second all-star berth .\nthe chicks finished fourth -lrb- 50 -- 60 -rrb- and lost to south bend in the first round of the playoffs in only two games .\nthe chicks clinched the aagpbl title in 1953 ,

to grand <mask> home ballpark for game 2 , and earlene risinger silenced the peaches ' bats to just two measly hits en route to a complete game , 2 -- 0 shutout .\nher clutch performance was backed by timely hitting by ziegler , who hit a rbi single in the seventh inning to give her a 1 -- 0 lead , and dolores moore , who drove in the game 's final run with a sacrifice fly in the eight .\nin game 3 , grand rapids starter dorothy mueller pitched well enough to beat rockford , 4 -- 3 , and the chicks advanced to the championship series to face the kalamazoo lassies , managed by mitch skupien , who have eliminated fort wayne in the other playoff contention .\nin the final series , grand rapids swept kalamazoo in the best of three game set , by the scores of 5 -- 2 and 4 -- 1 .\nin game 1 ,

three batters in order , striking out isabel alvarez , retiring dorothy schroeder with a pop fly to shortstop ziegler , and inducing june peppas on a sharp grounder to the mound throwing to voyce at first base for the final out of the game .\nin <mask> , with cold weather around 40 degrees and windy , both teams ' managers agreed to play the game 2 in just seven innings .\nrisinger started for the chicks and pitched one of the best games of her career .\ngrand rapids gave her a one-run lead in the second inning , and wrapped up the scoring by producing three runs in the sixth , keyed by a two-run double off the bat of ricketts .\nrisinger gave up a rbi single to <mask> , and yielded only one extra-base hit , a solo home run by doris sams during kalamazoo 's two-run rally in the sixth inning .\nin the bottom of the <mask> , the lassies tried to rally again .\nfern <mask> opened with a single , but risinger retired the next two batters .\nnevertheless , she lost her control temporarily and issued back-to-back walks to schroeder and peppas .\nwith the bases loaded , woody english was on the verge of yanking risinger , but he instead sent ziegler to the pitching mound .\npulling off her glove , the ziegler looked up at the tall risinger .\n`` okay , beansie , can you get her out ? ''\nshe asked .\nblowing on her hand to keep her fingers warm against the fast-chilling night , the pitcher replied , `` i do n't know ziggy '' .\nsnapping the brim of her cap in place , the diminutive ziegler energetically ordered , `` well do it ! ''\nas a result , risinger faced the dangerous sams and struck out her on three straight fastballs .\nshe fanned nine lassies batters and walked four in completing her pitching gem .\nziegler and the chicks returned in 1954 for what turned out to be the league 's final season .\nshe raised her average to .200 -lrb- 43-for-215 -rrb- and scored 33 runs with 21 rbi in 86 games .\nfor the fourth time she was selected at second base for the all-star team .\nthe chicks finished in third place -lrb- 46 -- 45 -rrb- and advanced to the playoffs to face regular-season champ fort wayne -<mask>- 54 -- 40 -rrb- .\nbut a dispute erupted before the two teams had played the opening game at <mask> ballpark .\ndue to an injury to fort wayne 's regular catcher , the league voted to allow the daisies to add rockford all-star ruth richard to the roster .\nthe chicks , claiming that using a new player was unfair , played the first game under protest , which won by an 8 -- 7 score .\nattempting to resolve the matter the next game in fort wayne , chicks manager english and daisies pilot allington ended up fighting at home plate .\nafter tempers calmed , the entire fort wayne team voted not to play , so the chicks forfeited , allowing fort wayne to advance to the championship round .\nin the end , the kalamazoo lassies won the last aagpbl championship series by defeating the daisies three to two games .\nfirst in <mask> , and later in grand <mask> , the chicks made the playoffs every year of their existence .\n<mask> was the only player to be on the team during its eleven-year history .\nfollowing her baseball career , <mask> went back to <mask> and worked as a court reporter .\n<mask> , who never married , had two nieces and two great-nieces .\nafter retiring she became an avid golfer , was devoted to her family and her cats , and helped out the elderly as an active participant in the meals on wheels program .\nalma <mask> was a longtime resident of los osos , california , where she died at the age of <mask> ."}

though with less than half the aggregates of ernest tyldesley , hallows and makepeace .\nit was from 1923 , however , that he leaped to the top of the tree though increasing his finger spin to make him a deadly bowler on the many sticky pitches found in the north .\nhe took 140 wickets that year , and in 1924 - a summer so wet that only one lancashire match was played throughout on a pitch `` un `` affected by rain - he was consistently deadly except against the most exceptionally skilled batsmen .\nhis record that summer won him a place on the ashes tour of 1924/1925 , but he was a dreadful failure on the cast-iron australian wickets where the ball came straight through .\nhis wickets for the whole tour cost `` 41 runs apiece '' - a remarkable contrast to his record in england !\nhowever , at home tyldesley maintained his form as a bowler exceptionally well , and after a slight lapse in 1927 and 1928 he was back at his best in 1929 , heading the bowling averages and invariably proving unplayable after showers in a very dry summer .\nwith australian paceman ted mcdonald , tyldesley formed a bowling combination that was sufficient to give lancashire a hat-trick of championship wins between 1926 and 1928 : during these three years mcdonald took 484 wickets and tyldesley 303 -
