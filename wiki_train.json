He then began having short episodes of vertiginous attacks in which he felt the room was \"constantly going out of focus\" and inability to \"lock in on any one thing\".  The pt had several episodes of these presyncopal attacks w/o LOC.  The pt had no associated CP or palpitations, however noted some increased rate of breathing.  The pt also noted some reflux sx a/w attacks.  He denies f/c, ns, d/c, diploplia/photophobia.  Had associated nausea without vomiting as well as tinnitus, which he usually has.  Attacks began to affect driving so he presented to EW.\n\n\n\nPt has one prior episode similar to this experience in 2082, for which he received imaging studies including CT of the head, MRI/MRA, TCDs which revealed no infarcts, but poor flow in the mid-basilar artery.

I discussed with him the reason for his persistent positive stress test and the posterolateral redistribution being related to the circumflex occlusion. There is good collaterals to this territory and I told Ted he needs to continue to exercise to build up those collaterals. We will repeat a stress test on him next spring to make sure he has not had progression of disease in his other arteries. \n\n\n\n\n\nCC:   Ulysses B.

He has been very stable\n\nclinically over these past six months.  I believe this represents\n\na composite of the following three major changes in his medical\n\nregimen.  As you know, we have discontinued all beta blockers,\n\nand this has been associated with a symptomatic stability.  He\n\nhad biventricular pacing box placed, certainly contributing to\n\nhis overall improved status and he is now taking a regular dose\n\nof Lasix.  He is on 80 mg alternating with 40 mg per day.  He\n\ndoes have symptoms of fatigue, but his overall volume status is\n\nquite reasonable.  He is currently on Aldactone 25 mg daily and\n\nLasix 80 mg per day alternating with 40 mg per day, Captopril\n\n6.25 mg p.o. t.i.d., Zocor, insulin, Glucophage, aspirin, and\n\nmexiletine.  His amiodarone has been discontinued.  He does have\n\nasymptomatic ventricular tachycardia, often paced out of this,\n\nbut I am reluctant to recommend ablation therapy for him at the\n\npresent time.  He has not been shocked by his ICD.\n\n \n\nFunctionally he seems quite stable.  He does have mild fatigue,\n\nbut is otherwise reasonably active.  He will hopefully be\n\ntraveling to Miami this spring.\n\n \n\nPhysical examination today is of note for a weight of 184 lbs. \n\nHis blood pressure is 118/70, his resting pulse 69.  His neck\n\nveins are in fact, quite unimpressive.  There is minimal jugular\n\ndistention, perhaps 6-7 cm.  There is no hepatojugular reflux.  \n\n \n\n \n\nRe:  Brady Duvall\n\n     MR #425-03-15-1                 -2-                07/18/98\n\n \n\nLungs were clear.  Examination of his heart reveals a quiet\n\nprecordium.  S1 and S2 seem normal.  No S3, no gallop and no\n\nmurmur or mitral regurgitation.  Abdomen is benign without\n\npalpable liver or spleen and there was no peripheral edema. \n\nThere are bilateral varicosities.\n\n \n\nHis electrocardiogram shows pace rhythm.\n\n \n\nMr. Brady Duvall is currently stable on this regimen. \n\nAccordingly, I have made no changes.

As you know, Ms.\n\n  Adler is a 49 year old woman with four years of\n\n  essential hypertension and mild dyslipidemia who is\n\n  postmenopausal and has noticed increasing symptoms of chest\n\n  tightness associated with exertion.  A stress MIBI SPECT\n\n  study ordered by you demonstrated inferolateral mid and\n\n  basal inferior ischemia consistent with a left circumflex\n\n  distribution.  The details of the study include an exercise\n\n  protocol for which the patient exercised for 7 minutes and\n\n  15 seconds for 8.9 mets, with an increase in heart rate from\n\n  74 to 159 (which is 94% of predicted peak heart rate), and\n\n  increase in blood pressure from 134/80 to 210/80 (with a\n\n  rate pressure product of 33,390).  The test was stopped due\n\n  to fatigue and moderately severe chest pain.  EKG\n\n  demonstrated 1.5mm of upsloping depression in II, III, F and\n\n  V4-V5, and there were no noted arrhythmias.  \n\n  \n\n  Her past medical history is otherwise unremarkable and her\n\n  current medications include estrogen, Premarin, Provera, and\n\n  verapamil 240mg q.d.  A recent lipid panel demonstrated a\n\n  total cholesterol of 203, LDL of 142, and an HDL of 39.\n\n  \n\n  On physical examination, she is comfortable, well appearing\n\n  woman with a weight of 186 pounds, pulse 68 beats per minute\n\n  and regular, blood pressure 140/82 in the left arm.  Jugular\n\n  venous pressure was approximately 6-8cm of water.  Carotids\n\n  demonstrates normal upstroke with no bruits.  Chest\n\n  examination was clear to auscultation.  Heart examination\n\n  demonstrated a normal S1, positive S4, physiologically split\n\n  S2, no murmurs or rubs.  Abdominal examination was \n\n  \n\n  \n\n  RE:  Adler, Imogene\n\n  MRN: 618-13-82-6\n\n  Page 2\n\n  March 23, 2079\n\n  \n\n  \n\n  \n\n  unremarkable.  Peripheral examination demonstrated no\n\n  peripheral examination and 2+ bilateral peripheral pulses.  \n\n  \n\n  EKG demonstrated normal sinus rhythm and otherwise normal\n\n  EKG.  \n\n  \n\n  I reviewed the findings suggestive of an obstructive\n\n  coronary lesion in the left circumflex distribution and the\n\n  probability of her having single vessel coronary artery\n\n  disease as the culprit for her chest pain.  We reviewed the\n\n  options which include medical therapy and/or coronary\n\n  angiography and possible angioplasty.  I made no solid\n\n  recommendations for her, but suggested that the angioplasty\n\n  approach was a relatively low risk approach which may lead\n\n  to curing the obstructive lesion as opposed to medical\n\n  therapy, which would also be a well supported decision, and\n\n  I reviewed the evidence to suggest medical treatment of\n\n  single vessel disease does not shorten one's life span and\n\n  only affects the quality of life depending on the symptom\n\n  tolerance.  She and her husband are going to reflect on\n\n  these recommendations and get back to me by the end of the\n\n  week.  If she does decide to undergo coronary angiography\n\n  and possible angioplasty, we will schedule her immediately\n\n  in Cardiology.\n\n  \n\n  I have scheduled follow-up in one month regardless to see\n\n  her in the office.  Please do not hesitate to contact me if\n\n  I can be of any further assistance.\n\n  \n\n  With warm regards,\n\n  \n\n  \n\n  \n\n  William Gomes, M.D. \n\n  \n\n  WG/anderson\n\n  \n\n ******** Not reviewed by Attending Physician ********\nRecord date: 2085-09-13\n\n\nInternal Medicine\n\n\nReason for visit\nHyperlipidemia\nWeight management\nHematuria\n\n\nHistory of present illness  \nThe patient is here for follow up on multiple issues.

He experienced mild central chest pain on the night prior to admission while working outdoors, pain resolved after about an hour and he attributed it to GERD.  However, he awoke at 5:30 AM on the morning of presentation with recurrence of chest pain, 6/10 severity, lasted for about 15-30 minutes and then resolved with Maalox.  Pain recurred about 9:30, of similar severity, associated with dyspnea, diaphoresis, non radiating, non-pleuritic.  He again took zantac and Maalox without improvement.  After 15 minutes he walked to the local hospital ER and during walk the pain increased in severity to 8/10.  He describes the pain as similar to his previous MI.\n\nUpon arrival to FHO found to have ST elevations antero-lateral.  Given lopressor, heparin, integrillin, morphine, ASA, and medivac to WCH arranged for cath.  He states that by the time he was in transit, his chest pain had resolved.  He arrived at WCH, was taken directly to cath lab, found to have a proximal LAD lesion with cypher stent placed.  He remained chest pain free following the procedure and was sent to the CCU in stable condition.\n\nAt baseline he states he can walk    a couple    of miles without rest, he rarely takes stairs on a daily basis.  He smokes profusely and has little interest in quitting.  He feels he has had no occurrence of chest pain since last one.

He underwent CABG x 3 in 2092 at WMMC after being diagnosed with CAD after presenting with symptoms of jaw pain and SOB. Immediately after surgery he was told there was likely a problem with one of the grafts. He began to have symptoms of jaw pain and dypnea within a few weeks of surgery and presented to Beloit State where he had cath within 6 weeks of CABG- at that time his LAD graft was down and his distal LAD was stenosed. Failed attempt to stent the distal LAD, but it was PTCA'd with no real relief of his symptoms. Last year, he presented here with further progression of his anginal equivalent and underwent cath which showed further stenosis of the distal LAD. There was no PCI option available. \n\nHe has been aggressively managed with medications and initially his jaw pain improved, but the dyspnea has persisted. Unfortunately the jaw pain has reoccurred and he has become more symptomatic. He now presented for cath. \n\nToday he arrived via SDA for cath that showed his native disease to be severe with a 70% stenosis involving the ostium of the first diagonal branch. The mid-distal LAD is small and tapering with diffuse disease  up to 80%. The first diagonal has a high grade ostial stenosis. LCX has 40-50% stenosis proximal to the first OM. RCA has 80% stenosis proximally with competitive flow from the SVG. The LIMA-&gt; D1 is patent and the SVG-&gt; RCA is patent. The SVG-&gt; LAD is not visualized. The mid-LAD lesion was treated with PTCA/stenting with a 2.25 x 12 mm Taxus stent. He arrived on floor 5 pain free and in no distress. \n\n\t\nPast Medical History\nCAD \nCABG x 3 2092 (LIMA-&gt; LAD, SVG-&gt; LAD, SVG-&gt; RCA)\nHyperlipidemia\nHypertension\nDiabetes\nAnxiety/depression \n\n\t\nAllergies\nACE-i-&gt; cough\nDiovan-&gt; fatigue\nZocor, crestor-&gt; myalgias\nMetformin-&gt; GI intolerance\n\n\t\nSocial History\nMarried, 4 children\nLives with wife\nRetired floor covering installer, works for son doing accounting\n\n\t\nHabits\nETOH: 3 drinks/week on average\nSmoking:  quit 30 yrs ago\nCaffeine: 5-6/day (coffee and diet coke)\nDiet: diabetic\nExercise: unable to do much d/t symptoms\n\n\t\nFamily History\n\n\t\n7 sbilings with HTN\nFather with heart problems- died at 86\n\nMedications\nAt Home:\n\nImdur 60 mg QD\nRanexa 1000 mg BID\nLasix 20 mg QD\nLipitor 40 mg QD\nPlavix 75 mg QD\nLexapro 10 mg QD\nLopressor 12.5 mg BID\nProtonix 40 mg QD\nKCL 10 mEq QD\nECASA 325 mg QD\nNorvasc 10 mg QD\nAmbien 10 mg QD\n\n\t\n\n\t\nPhysical Exam\nHeight: 67\"\nWeight: 180 lbs\n\n\t\nVS: 100/50, 63, 18\nMonitor: SR/SB\n\n\t\nGen: well appearing caucasian male in NAD\n\n\t\nNeuro: alert, oriented x 3, speech clear and articulate.

Since I last saw Ms. Law, she underwent a 3-vessel coronary artery bypass surgery, internal mammary to the left anterior descending artery, free right radial graft to the obtuse marginal branch of the left circumflex, and reverse saphenous vein graft to the posterior descending branch of the right coronary artery.  She tolerated the surgery quite well and had a short rehab stay.  Currently, she is doing some walking, but is still feeling quite tired and a bit deconditioned.  However, her breathing does feel better than prior to the surgery.  She has some residual sternal wound pain, but it has improved since her discharge.\n\n\n\nCurrent Medications:\n\n1.  Aspirin 325 mg daily.\n\n2.  DuoNeb.\n\n3.  Diltiazem 300 mg p.o. t.i.d.\n\n4.  Furosemide 40 mg p.o. daily.\n\n5.  K-Dur 20 mEq p.o. daily.\n\n6.  Metolazone 2.5 mg daily.\n\n7.  Toprol 100 mg p.o. b.i.d.\n\n8.  Pravastatin 20 mg p.o. daily.\n\n9.  Furosemide 40 mg p.o. daily.\n\n10.  Colace, ferrous sulfate, ibuprofen, senna.\n\n\n\nAdverse Medication Reactions:\n\n1.  Azithromycin.\n\n2.  ACE inhibitor, cough.\n\n3.  Latex, angioedema.\n\n\n\nOn physical examination, heart rate 81, blood pressure 106/75, and weight of 246.  In general, she is well appearing, in no apparent distress.  Jugular venous pressure is 6 cm of water.  Carotids are 2+, no bruits.  The chest is clear to auscultation and percussion, a well-healed median sternotomy, regular rate and rhythm.  No significant murmurs, gallops, or rubs.  Abdomen:  Soft, nontender, nondistended, no masses, bruits, organomegaly.  Extremities:  1-2+ edema.\n\n\n\nReview of labs dated 05/28/2134, potassium 4.3, creatinine 0.9, ALT 16, AST 16, total cholesterol 125, triglycerides 106, HDL 36, and LDL 68.\n\n\n\nIn summary, the patient is a 62-year-old woman status post CABG, doing well.  She does appear to be mildly volume overloaded today, therefore I will make the following medication adjustments.  As far as her cardiac meds, they will change to aspirin 81 mg daily, potassium 20 mEq daily, Lasix 40 mg p.o. b.i.d., metoprolol succinate 100 mg p.o. daily, and pravastatin 20 mg p.o. daily.\n\n\n\nI will titrate her Lasix on an outpatient basis to have her lose 5-7 pounds to improve her shortness of breath as well as her edema.

The patient has had a chronic arthritic pain throughout his body, which he has been complaining of for approximately 10 years involving his \nneck, shoulder, arms, knees, and back.  More recently in the past months to couple of years, his neck, left arm, and shoulder pain have been his predominant pain symptoms.  It has been a gradual onset.  He has had similar problems in the past.  He reports that his pain is intermittent and occurs daily.  He states the pain is burning, cramping, pins and needle, sharp, numb, shooting pain, dull achy, electric- like, throbbing, and pressure-like.  The pain involves numbness to his hands and fingers on his left arm.  His pain ranges from 10/10 at worst to 0/10 at best.  It is worse in almost all active positions including lying down, standing, sitting, walking, and driving.  Medications do not seem to help.  Relaxation and rest decreases the pain.  It is also worsened by lifting or bending his neck.  He tried physical therapy approximately 10 days ago at Manamana with minimal to no relief.  The patient has had injections to his cervical spine in the past, he has had shoulder injections, which helped in the past.  He had MRI performed of his \ncervical spine on March 21, 2161, which documented moderate- to-severe degenerative changes throughout his cervical spine with significant right neuroforaminal narrowing at multiple levels.  There is narrowing of the left neural foramen at \nC5-6.  \n \nPAST MEDICATIONS:  The patient is not clear what pain medicines he has taken in the past.  \n \nCurrent medications include Nexium, Colace, atenolol, aspirin, Neurontin 200 mg two times a day, insulin, Pravachol, glucosamine chondroitin, vitamin E, Lasix, and potassium chloride.  \n \nHe has allergies to penicillin, Vioxx, and Lipitor.   \nPast medical history is significant for high blood pressure, heart disease, insulin-dependent diabetes, \nhypercholesterolemia, congestive heart failure, and bladder cancer.  \n \nSURGICAL HISTORY:  He denies any spine surgery.  He has had two prior arthroscopic knee surgeries.  He had twice left shoulder surgery; he is not clear what this was.  He has had a TURP.  \n \nPSYCHOSOCIAL HISTORY:  He has high school eduction.  He is not currently engaged in regular exercise program.  His pain does limit his daily activities, especially bending over and also affects his recreational activities including regular yard work and lifting.  He also has lifting restrictions from orthopedic physician as well as yard work restrictions from his cardiac physician.  He is a retired wholesale specialist.  He worked for over 30 years in sales \nbusiness.  He is not currently working.  He is married and lives in Dickinson, Maryland.  He denies any history of alcoholism, detox program or current tobacco use.  He denies any history of psychologic evaluation or treatments including _____ and no history of abuse.   \nHe has family history heart disease and diabetes.  \n \nReview of systems is negative for any unexplained weight loss, fevers, chills, recent infections, bleeding, positive bowel or bladder incontinence, numbness in the genital area.  He does report some numbness and tingling in his arms as well as legs as reported above and some generalized weakness of his muscles, particularly with his left upper extremity muscles throughout.  He denies any problems with sleep.   \nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  In general, he is a well-appearing gentleman appearing his stated age, slight obese, well nourished, well groomed.  Psychiatric:  Normal attention and concentration, normal mood and affect.  Eyes:  Conjunctivae anicteric, no ptosis.  Skin:  No rashes or lesions.  Heart: Regular rate and rhythm.  Lungs:  No intercostal retractions \nor accessory muscle use.  Musculoskeletal:  Spine \ninspection, no significant kyphoscoliosis.  Cervical range of motion is limited throughout.  Flexion 20 degrees, extension 10 degrees, rotation is 20 degrees, right and left.  The patient is unable to side bend significantly. Reflexes are 2+, bilateral biceps, triceps, brachioradialis. Manual muscle testing is 5/5, bilateral upper extremities \nwith the exception of wrist extension, shoulder abduction, and shoulder flexion and extension, and internal, external rotation.  Muscle tone is normal with the exception of asymmetry in the left hand interossei.  Sensory testing is impaired to pinprick, throughout bilateral upper extremities to the elbows.  Intact grossly to light touch per the patient's report.  Gait is steady with a cane.  The patient has signs of limited range of motion in the left shoulder, status post multiple surgeries and limited range of motion in all directions.  He has some palpation tenderness of the cervical spine, in C5-6 and C4-5 paravertebral areas on the left.   \nMedical decision making involved review of the patient's radiology reports and radiology films.  \n \nIMPRESSION:  The patient has a significant degenerative disease of his cervical spine.  In addition, he has multiple levels of neural foraminal narrowing and herniation in the cervical spine.  In addition to this, he has symptoms consistent with diabetic peripheral neuropathy with also prior traumatic injury to his shoulder with possible brachial plexopathy.  \n \nRECOMMENDATIONS:  \n1.  Given the multiple etiologies possible for his symptoms in his left arm, which are his predominant symptoms:  Brachial plexopathy versus peripheral neuropathy versus cervical radiculopathy, we have referred the patient for an EMG to delineate the cause of his symptoms.  \n2.  He will return to clinic after his EMG and from that point, we will decide the course of action for pain management.  At this time, he will continue on the Neurontin 200 mg two times a day.  We will review his medications on next visit.  We provided the patient also with education in regards to his problems and the treatment options.   \n______________________________ \nTyler Quinonez, M.D.  \n \nDD:08/09/2161 \nDT:08/10/2161 \nYG:272499    :3240\nRecord date: 2162-01-22\n\n\n\n\n\nINTERNAL MEDICINE ASSOCIATES\n\nNORTHLAND MEDICAL CLINIC\n\n\n\nReason for visit   f/u\n\n\n\nMajor Problems\n\nHypertension\n\non atenolol50 QD.

He still has significant difficulty walking, and he is falling frequently at home. He has not sustained any significant injuries.  He has numbness and paresthesias of his feet, but there has been no interval change in his symptoms since his last visit in November 2162.\n\n\n\nMedications:  Neurontin 300mg TID, Lasix 40mg daily, aspirin, Atenolol 50mg daily, Zetia 10mg, Pravastatin 20mg, Nexium and multi vitamins.\n\n\n\nExamination:  reveals that strength testing in the legs is normal.  He has absent deep tendon reflexes of the ankles, trace to 1+ at the knees.  Romberg's test is positive, and the patient has difficulty standing without assistance.  Despite the degree of sensory ataxia, he is still able to feel position sense at the metatarsophalangeal joints in his feet. Vibration and pinprick sensation are diminished.\n\n\n\nData Review:  The patient does have a persistent low concentration of monoclonal protein in the slow gamma region.  This is unchanged compared to the previous study done in February 2162. This most likely is a MGUS.\n\n\n\nImpression and Recommendation:  The patient has poorly controlled diabetes, complicated by polyneuropathy.  The monoclonal protein is an incidental finding and is probably not accounting for his peripheral neuropathy.  Given that the monoclonal protein has not changed in concentration or character I do not believe that there is a need for additional testing at this stage.  He will continue with Neurontin to manage his neuropathic symptoms.  I have urged him to try and maintain good diabetic control.

These are consistent with his known occluded diagonal (also unbypassed).  His last cath in 6/62 showed patent vein grafts to his OM and to his RCA and a patent but atretic LIMA.  He has an occluded RCA, an 80% OM, and a 60% LAD in addition to the occluded diagonal (fills via OM collaterals).  \n\nHe was admitted to Fahey Center in May with syncope associated with bradycardia.  His atenolol was changed to coreg and he has had no difficulties since that time.  He does have a long-standing trifasicular block.\n\nHe denies any chest pain, orthopnea, PND, LEE, palpitations, or syncope since that admission.\n\nSomeone started him on Niaspan which has been associated with diffuse flushing, itching, and a burning sensation.\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\tPast medical history:\n\n   CAD with CABG in 4/61, LIMA to LAD, V to RCA PLVB, V to OM  -- he has an unbypassed occluded Diagonal with collaterals from the OM\n\nDressler's\n\nHTN\n\nlipids\n\nDM\n\nneuropathy\n\nFrozen shoulder\n\nGERD\n\nTIAs 2153 and 12/2160\n\nBladder CA\n\ns/p TURP\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\tMedications (Confirmed):\n\n\t\t\t\n\naspirin\n\nCoreg 3.125mg po qd\n\nDiovan\n\nInsulin syringes\n\nKlor con 10meq po qd\n\nLasix 40mg po qd\n\nNeurontin 300 mg po tid\n\nNexium 40mg po qd\n\nNPH insulin 48units sc qam\n\nOnetouch strips\n\nPravachol 20mg po qd\n\nregular insulin sc\n\nZetia 10mg po qd\n\n\n\nAllergies:\n\n\t\t\t\n\nDrug allergy   Vioxx.

His chest pain syndromes have resolved.  He has a long-standing trifasicular block and had what sounds like syncope a few months ago.  This was associated with bradycardia and has resolved with changing him to low dose coreg.\n\nCV risk factor modification remains our primary focus.\n\nPlan.\n\n1. CAD-increase asa to 325 and take at night with niaspan in hopes of lessening side effects.  He needs an ARB, so will try again to get him to take diovan at 80 a day (I gave samples and a Rx).\n\n2. LV dysfunction--we will check a GBPS for EF.\n\n3. DM-followed by Dr. Orton.  Continue to aim for an A1c of 7.0\n\n4. Carotid disease--this seems to be limited to the external carotid, so I don't think any intervention will be necessary.  Continue to Rx risk factors.\n\n5. Lipids-look great today.  Continue as is, but given his past intolerance of and noncompliance with meds, I suspect he will give up the Niaspan soon!  We will try to give asa with it to help with the side effects.\n\n6. HTN--home BPs have been higher too on coreg.  I am trying to get him on an ARB again.  Diovan at 80 a day.

As\nyou know, she has been complaining of leg cramps mostly at night. \nShe has been taking quinine for this, however develops palpitations\nwhenever she takes the quinine.  She has not been taking this since\nthe initial two doses.  I suspect that her leg cramps are probably\nsecondary to intermittent passing fluxes.  I have told her to eat\na banana during the evening and possibly this would avoid leg\ncramps in the evening.  In the meantime, her EKG showed sinus\nbradycardia at a rate of 50 per minute.

As you\nknow, we performed a persantine MIBI recently which showed inferior\nwall ischemia.  I wasn't sure whether or not this ischemia was new. \nOn review of her coronary artery bypass surgery notes, she did not\nhave her totally occluded right coronary artery bypass.  Therefore,\nI suggest that this reversible ischemia in the inferior wall is\nprobably old and was the result of the fact that they did not\nbypass this area.  She did have a LIMA to the LAD and two saphenous\nvenous grafts to the circumflex territory, the OM and the diagonal. \nShe has been doing relatively well with chest discomfort and I\nrecommended we continue her current cardiac medications.  However,\nshe has been complaining of pounding headaches and she did have a\nhistory of otitis media in her right ear.  Therefore, I think it\nwouldn't be unreasonable to refer her to ENT to have them evaluate\nher ears as a possible source of her pounding headaches.  In the\nmeantime, I have suggested that she take her nifedipine and\nnitroglycerin in the event that her blood pressure shoots up during\nthese episodes.  I suspect that her blood pressure rise during\nthese episodes is due more to anxiety than to intrinsic problem\nwith her cardiovascular system.  She will return to see me in\nfollow-up in three months time, at which time I will check her\ncholesterol level.\n \nAgain, thank you for allowing me to participate in the care of your\npatient.

As you know, Ms. Benitez has been having a\n\nterrible past month with increasing episodes of substernal chest\n\ndiscomfort.  One episode occurred during Ramadan when she was\n\nfasting and another occurred while she was in a restaurant.  Both of\n\nthese episodes were relieved with sublingual nitroglycerine.  I\n\nam concerned about her discomfort because of an earlier\n\nPersantine MIBI study showing anteroapical redistribution on her\n\ntest and the fact that it was relieved by nitroglycerine. \n\nCurrently she denies any PND, orthopnea or chest discomfort.  She\n\ncontinues to have back and bilateral hip pain and has been taking\n\ncorticosteroid shots for that.\n\n \n\nOn physical examination, she is an anxious, concerned, elderly\n\nwoman.  Blood pressure is 160/70 in the left arm.  Jugular venous\n\npulse is not observed.  She has bilateral carotid bruits.  Chest\n\nexam is clear.  Cardiac exam shows an S4 gallop, a normal S1, a\n\nphysiologically split S2 and a 2/6 systolic murmur at the left\n\nsternal border.  Abdominal exam is benign.  Peripheral exam shows\n\ntrace pedal edema.\n\n \n\nEKG shows sinus bradycardia at a rate of 50 beats per minute. \n\nThere are Q waves in V1 through V4, consistent with an old\n\nanterolateral MI.

My hope is that we will not have to\n\nrevascularize her again.  If we do, I am hoping to do so with\n\npotential angioplasty and stenting.  In the meantime, I have\n\nswitched her from Zocor 40 mg to Lipitor 40 mg a day in the hopes\n\nof targeting her LDL cholesterol to the new guidelines of 100. \n\nHer previous LDL cholesterol was 111.  I also suggested to her in\n\nthe meantime to cut down on her physical activities until we know\n\nthe results of the thallium test and also to forgo one episode of\n\nher steroid injection for her back.\n\n \n\nPlease let me know if you have any further questions or concerns\n\nregarding this patient.

There has been no diagnostic change since\n\nJuly 18, 2086.\n\n \n\nCarotid duplex ultrasound examination performed on October 31,\n\n2086 showed a 55% stenosis of the right internal carotid artery\n\nand a 50% stenosis of the left internal carotid artery.  The\n\nvelocity of the right internal carotid artery and the subsequent\n\ncalculation of stenosis was less than it had been in February\n\n2086.  \n\n \n\nGraft scans obtained on October 31, 2086 demonstrated patent left\n\nfemoral-anterior tibial artery bypass graft with increased\n\nvelocities consistent with a greater than 75% stenosis at the mid\n\nthigh level and this was increased from a study of August 06, 2086. \n\nThe right femoral-dorsalis pedis arterial bypass graft was patent\n\nwith no evidence of significant stenoses.  \n\n \n\nIn summary, her problems relevant to this visit include:\n\n \n\n1.  Coronary artery disease.  Status post coronary artery bypass\n\nsurgery.  LIMA to the LAD and SVGs to the diagonal and\n\nposterolateral left ventricular branch.  She has occasional and\n\nvery transient episodes of angina.  I have suggested continuing\n\nher current medical regimen.  As noted previously, I prefer to\n\nmanage her medically unless her symptoms worsen.  \n\n \n\n2.  Carotid artery disease.  She is asymptomatic.  I recommend\n\nperiodic surveillance with carotid ultrasound. \n\n \n\n3.  Peripheral arterial disease.  Both grafts are patent but the\n\nleft femoral-anterior bypass graft appears by ultrasound to have\n\na significant stenosis.  I have asked her to discuss this finding\n\nwith you further.\n\n \n\nBenitez, Wonda                                    MRN: 89276954\n\nNovember 07, 2086              -3-\n\n \n\n \n\n4.  Hypercholesterolemia.  A lipid profile will be checked today. \n\n \n\n \n\n5.  Systolic murmur and query antibiotic prophylaxis for dental\n\nprocedures.  I am evaluating her murmurs, which were presumably\n\naortic sclerosis and mitral regurgitation, with an\n\nechocardiogram.  \n\n \n\nSincerely,\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nThomas Waller, M.D.\n\n \n\ncc:\n\nTerry W.

As you know, he is a 61-year-old white male who has a history of myocardial infarction approximately six years ago and had stenting at that time and subsequently had another stent placed in 2076.  He has done well since that time without any exertional angina, dyspnea on exertion, PND, orthopnea, or pedal edema.  He has been followed here by Dr.  Opal Garner and has been noted to have an anteroapical aneurysm.  He underwent surgery for hip replacement of his left hip last summer and has recovered from that.  He did get on to about 220 pounds before the surgery, but has gained 20 pounds back and is now at about 240 pounds.  He says that most of this is because of inactivity.  He likes to work in his yard in Barnstable and plans to increase his activity and try and drop off some of that weight this summer.\n\n\n\nPast medical history:\n\n   Significant for diabetes, large anteroseptal myocardial infarction, sleep apnea, diverticulosis, tubular adenoma of the colon, and diverticulitis.\n\n\n\nCurrent Medications:\n\n  Imdur 30 mg qd\n\n Lasix 10 mg qd\n\n Lipitor 20 mg qd\n\n lisinopril 40 mg qd\n\n Plavix 75 mg qd\n\n aspirin 325 mg qd\n\n Prilosec 20 mg qd\n\n Toprol XL 25 mg qd\n\n nitroglycerin PRN\n\n\n\nFamily history:\n\n   Unchanged from previous visits.\n\n\n\nSocial history:\n\n   He is retired.  He lives in Barnstable.  He likes to work in his yard.  He quit smoking several years ago.\n\n\n\nReview of systems:\n\n   Unchanged from previous visits.\n\n\n\nPhysical examination:\n\n-Pulse:   66 and regular\n\n-BP: 130/70  \n\n-resp. rate:   12 and unlabored\n\n-General:   He is a well-developed, well-nourished white male in no acute distress.  Alert and cooperative.  Mildly overweight\n\n-Heent:   No xanthelasma, scleral icterus, proptosis, or lid lag.  Mucous membranes are moist.  Trachea is midline\n\n-Neck:   Thyroid is nonpalpable.  Carotids are 2+ without bruits, have a normal upstroke.  JVP is less than 7 cm of water\n\n-Chest:   Clear without rales, rhonchi, or wheezes\n\n-Cardiac:   Reveals a normal S1 and S2, with a grade 1/6 holosystolic murmur at the left sternal border\n\n-Abdomen:   Normal bowel sounds.  No organomegaly.  No pulsatile masses\n\n-Extremities:   Peripheral pulses are 2+ and symmetric.  He has trace pedal edema bilaterally\n\n\n\nProcedures:\n\nEchocardiogram test STATUS POST His last echo.  which showed an ejection fraction of 52% with some asymmetric septal hypertrophy with upper septal prominence.  There was trace MR and trace TR and the evidence of his apical aneurysm.\n\nStress test STATUS POST at that time as well as  07/10/2080. He exercised for 4 minutes, got to 44% of his predicted maximum heart rate.  There was no evidence of ischemia.  There was evidence of a previous anteroapical, anteroseptal infarct.\n\n\n\nEKG:\n\n    shows normal sinus rhythm, left atrial enlargement, right bundle branch block, and a possible old IMI and old ASMI.\n\n\n\nSelected recent labs:\n\n The patient's last blood work was 08/17/2080 and at that time his BUN was 9, creatinine 0.8, potassium was 3.8, blood glucose 145, cholesterol was 96, triglycerides 70, HDL 42, and LDL 40.\n\n\n\nAssessment and plan:\n\n   In summary, this is a very pleasant 61-year-old gentleman who has a history of a big anteroseptal MI approximately six years ago.  He has had stenting of his coronaries in 2076.  He is without any evidence of ischemia at this time.  He has a fairly good LV function.  There is an LV aneurysm, but Coumadin has been deferred and he has been treated with aspirin and Plavix.  He is on a good medical regimen.  Blood pressure seems to be well controlled.  He does not have any evidence of severe decompensated congestive heart failure.  He does have some trace pedal edema.  His weight has gone up significantly since the operation for his hip and I have encouraged him to start walking program and try and drop off that weight this summer.  I would like to do CBC, electrolytes, creatinine, BUN, and a CBC with lipids today.  My plan would be keep him on his current regimen and see him back here in another six months to see how he is doing with his weight.  Cholesterol has been in very good shape and I do not expect that to be a problem.\n\n\n\nChanges to Medications this visit\n\nImdur 30 mg   qd\n\nLasix 10 mg   qd\n\nLipitor 20 mg   qd\n\nlisinopril 40 mg   qd\n\nPlavix 75 mg   qd\n\naspirin 325 mg   qd\n\nPrilosec 20 mg   qd\n\nToprol XL 25 mg   qd\n\nnitroglycerin     PRN\n\n\n\nAs always, it is a pleasure to be able to participate in the care of this very pleasant gentleman.  \n\n\n\nBest personal regards.  \n\n\n\nSincerely yours,\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBrent Cameron MD, PhD\n\n\n\nSigned electronically by   Brent  Cameron MD, PhD  on  Apr 19, 2081\nRecord date: 2081-12-03\n\n\n\n\tCARDIOLOGY\n\n\t\n\n\tALGIERS MEDICAL CENTER\n\n\t\n\n\n\nNicholas M Osuna M.D. \n\nInternal Medicine\n\nAMC Interoffice Mail\n\n,  \n\n\n\nDear Dr.  Osuna:\n\n\n\n  I had the pleasure of seeing Mr.  Nicholas Cortez in my office today in Cardiology at AMC.

He has been noted to have an anteroapical aneurysm and when I saw him in October, was having some discomfort which may have been myocardial ischemia and angina.  His blood pressure was elevated, so we added Diovan to control the blood pressure.  He has had some dimunition in the symptoms and the frequency of these symptoms got arrangement for.  Exercise test was also put in place and the exercise results are now available as well as the echocardiography that had been scheduled at that time.  He still has occasional ankle swelling, but is able to walk without discomfort.  He has gained some weight over the summer and is having difficulties staying away from salty foods, particularly he likes pastrami.

Imaging showed an ejection fraction of 31%.  Perfusion images showed mild-to-distal anteroapical and septal scars associated with mild distal anterior ischemia.  The apex appeared more aneurysmal than the previous stress test and the LV was more dilated with a decrease in left ventricular ejection fraction from 38 to 31.\n\n\n\n\tEKG:\n\n    shows normal sinus rhythm, left atrial enlargement, and a right bundle branch block with an old IMI.\n\n\n\n\tAssessment and plan:\n\n   In summary, this is a very pleasant 61-year-old gentleman who has a history of a large anteroseptal MI approximately six years ago, had stenting his LAD in 2076, and now has a recurrence of what sounds like possible angina and a positive stress test has a decrease in LV function, increase in LV aneurysmal dilatation, and ischemia in the anterior distribution. There is a discrepancy between the ejection fraction on the echo and I suspect that has to do with differences in technique. I have talked with the patient about cardiac catheterization and I would like to get him in for that as soon as possible so we can assess the degree of coronary disease. Hopefully it is amenable to percutaneous angioplasty, but I am somewhat concerned about the left ventricular aneurysm. We will arrange for cardiac catheterization either next week or the following week and I will plan to see him back here in the office approximately a month which will be after his catheterization and hopeful angioplasty.\n\n\n\nChanges to Medications this visit\n\n\t\n\naspirin 325 mg   qd\n\nDiovan 80 mg   qd\n\nImdur 30 mg   qd\n\nLasix 10 mg   qd\n\nLipitor 20 mg   qd\n\nlisinopril 40 mg   qd\n\nnitroglycerin    \n\n\n\nAs always, it is a pleasure to be able to participate in the care of this very pleasant gentleman.  \n\n\n\nBest personal regards.  \n\n\n\nSincerely yours,\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\nBrent Cameron MD, PhD\n\n\n\n\tSigned electronically by   Brent  Cameron MD, PhD  on  Dec 08, 2081"}

All other vessels had only minimal irregularities.  Since that time, he has had only mild chest discomfort which is always relieved with nitroglycerin.  \n\n\n\nThis morning, he had a more severe episode of chest pain accompanied by SOB and diaphoresis that started when walking to the dock after starting his boat.  The pain was primarily in his back, similar to his angina prior to stenting.  The pain lasted for approximately 30 min despite SL NTG, although did go away eventually.  He had diaphoresis, SOB, and blurred vision associated with the pain.  He was brought to the ED by his family.  On arrival, he was pain free. P 60 BP 110/70.  He was treated with ASA and Lopressor.  EKG was unremarkable.  Two sets of markers were negative.  He is admitted to complete rule out MI and further diagnostic testing.\n\n\n\nHe currently denies pain and feels back to his baseline.

His cardiac history dates back to March 2095 when he experienced dyspnea and exertional chest pressure that radiated to his jaw and arms. Cardiac catheterization at that time showed LAD disease and he underwent PTCA/Taxus stent to his LAD. \n\nHe did well until August 2096 when he presented with a dull mid scapular discomfort that radiated to his upper chest. These symptoms were accompanied by diaphoresis, dyspnea and transient blurry vision. After evaluation and clearance by Neurology he underwent another cardiac catheterization. Catheterization revealed his LAD stent was patent but he had a 90% lesion proximal to the stent. He had PTCA/Vision stent to his LAD. \n\nSince 11/19/2096 he has had complaints of increasing dyspnea on exertion and chest pressure. He was treated with antibiotics and prednisone with relief of his dyspnea. He continues with daily exertional chest discomfort that resolves with rest and sl nitroglycerin. \n\nToday he presented for elective cardiac catheterization which show ed a proximal 90% occlusion and mild In stent restenosis. He had a cypher stent placed in his LAD.

As her history is well\nknown to you, I will repeat it briefly for our records.  Mrs.\nOlivier is a 62-year-old woman with a longstanding history of\ncoronary artery disease.  After several catheterizations in the\n2060's which failed to document significant coronary artery disease\n(done for evaluation of chest pain), angiogram in July of 2071\nshowed moderate circumflex coronary artery disease for which she\nwas managed medically.  However, she suffered a non-Q wave\nmyocardial infarction on February of 2072 at which time she\nunderwent cardiac catheterization now showing progressive coronary\nartery disease and therefore underwent a multi-vessel coronary\nbypass graft operation including a left internal mammary artery to\nher LAD and reverse saphenous vein grafts to her PDA, D1 and obtuse\nmarginal branch.  She underwent repeat catheterization in February\nof 2073 at the Comfrey Clinic which showed diffuse native disease\nbut apparently no significant bypass graft pathology.  She\nunderwent repeat cardiac catheterization in May of 2074 because of\na current angina and at this time she had evidence for a 60%\nproximal LAD stenosis, a proximal severe circumflex artery stenosis\nwith no occlusion at the origin at a first obtuse marginal branch\nand a 70% stenosis in the mid right coronary artery.  The saphenous\nvein graft to the diagonal branch was patent with a significant\nstenosis at its distal and astigmatic site, a saphenous vein graft\nto the second obtuse marginal branch was patent as was the\nsaphenous vein graft to the posterolateral branch.  The left\nintramammary artery to the LAD was a small vessel without discrete\nstenoses.  Left ventriculogram demonstrated a moderate area of\nposterior basal akinesis with a global ejection fraction of 60%. \nShe therefore was transferred to the Midwest Eire Center\nin early June where she underwent successful PTCA of her vein graft\nto her diagonal artery.  She tolerated this uneventfully and was \n \n \nOlivier, Christine\nMR #652-33-21-5                    -2-            July 05, 2074\n \ndischarged and since then has not had significant exertional chest\ndiscomfort.  Her primary complaint is one of fatigue and mild\nexertional dyspnea.  She has undergone extensive pulmonary\nevaluation in the past including pulmonary function tests which\nhave revealed an FEV1 of 1.3 which is 59% predicted, and an FVC of\n1.5 which is also 55% predicted giving her a pattern consistent\nwith restrictive rather than obstructive pulmonary disease.  In\naddition, she has a history of a seizure disorder, diabetes,\nhypertension and a nonspecific peripheral neuropathy.  \n \nMedications at present:  NPH insulin 60 units sub q qAM, CZI\ninsulin 30 units sub q qAM, NPH insulin 60 units sub q qPM, enteric\ncoated aspirin one tab po q.d., atenolol 50 mg po b.i.d., Captopril\n25 mg po t.i.d., amlodipine 5 mg po q.d., simvastatin 10 mg po\nq.d., nitroglycerin prn, Nitropatch .2 mg for twelve hours of a\ntwenty-four hour period, Neurontin 300 mg one tab po t.i.d.,\nTrusopt one drop ou q.d., Alantin one drop ou q.h.s. and albuterol\ninhalers two puffs q.i.d. prn.\n \nCigarettes - none at present.  \n \nPhysical exam reveals a well-nourished mildly overweight woman in\nno acute distress.  Blood pressure right arm sitting 140/70, heart\nrate 75 and regular, respirations 12 and unlabored, weight 172\npounds.  The neck is supple.  JVP flat.  Carotids are 2+ without\nsignificant bruits.  Chest is clear with a trace right basilar\nrhonchi.  Cardiac exam shows a normal S1, physiologically split S2\nand a I-II/VI systolic ejection murmur radiating from the apex to\nthe base, no significant diastolic murmur or rub.  The abdomen is\nbenign with bowel sounds well heard.  Extremities without\nappreciable edema.  Peripheral pulses are intact.  There is 1+\nbipedal edema. \n \nElectrocardiogram shows sinus rhythm at a rate of 75.  PR interval\nof .14, QRS .08, QT .34, axis -20 degrees.  There is evidence of a\nleft atrial abnormality and poor R wave progression in leads V1\nthrough V3.  \n \nImpression:  Mrs. Olivier is a 62-year-old woman with significant \natherosclerosis, diabetes and now a chief complaint of modest\nexertional dyspnea and fatigue.  She denies any active chest\ndiscomfort and apparently her recent angioplasty was successful at\nalleviating the chest pain syndrome.  The records available to me\nindicate that there is no continued efforts to diminish her beta\nblocker therapy however in the past this had lead to an\nexacerbation of her angina.  However, now that she is status post\nher PTCA it is possible she now again will tolerate beta blocker\nreduction and therefore, I suggested she decrease her atenolol to\n50 mg po q.d.  She will have her blood pressure checked within the\nnext several days and assuming she remains asymptomatic, I will\n \n \nOlivier, Christine\nMR #652-33-21-5                    -3-            July 05, 2074\n \nalso try diminishing her amlodipine in part because of peripheral\nedema and in part because she may no longer need this.  Otherwise,\nI have made no specific alterations to her medical regimen except\nto encourage her to continue her aerobic activity level as best she\ncan and watch her saturated fat and cholesterol intake and stay in\nclose contact with you should her chest pain syndrome at all recur. \nI would be happy to assist in her management in any way you deem\nappropriate.\n \nSincerely yours,\n \n \n \nIrineo Tovar, M.D.\nVereen Memorial Hospital\n25 Waverly St\nColorado City,  NY  88736\n \nDD: 07/05/74\nDT: 07/11/74\nDV: 07/05/74\n \n/outlaw\n \n \n \n ******** Approved but not reviewed by Attending Provider ********\nRecord date: 2074-12-05\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nDecember 05, 2074\n \n \nPaul Arteaga, M.D.\n228 Caldwell Road\nColorado City,  NY  43414\n \nRE:  Christine Olivier\n     MR #652-33-21-5\n \nDear Dr. Arteaga:\n \nMrs. Olivier returns for routine follow-up.

Currently it is not\nclear to me that her symptoms are secondary to recurrent ischemia,\nhowever I will have her undergo an exercise tolerance test\n(adenosine MIBI) to help to further evaluate this.  In addition, I\nwill obtain routine blood studies including an glycosylated\nhemoglobin.  It is certainly possible that her fatigue and\ngeneralized sense of lack of energy is from a non-cardiac cause. \nPending review of these lab studies however, I have not altered her\npresent regimen.

This is a \n65-year-old female status post multiple angioplasties and stent \nplacement.  She had recurrence of her typical angina at home, took \nthree nitroglycerin with minimal relief, and activated the 911 \nsystem.  Her pre-hospital electrocardiogram shows a small amount of \nST depression, perhaps 1 mm, and flattening V3-V6.  This is \ncomparable to a previous electrocardiogram in October, which may \nhave been her most recent presentation with ischemia.  She was \ngiven aspirin and nitroglycerin, and continued to have pain in the \nEmergency Department.  The total duration of pain was approximately \ntwo hours. \nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Her vital signs remained stable. \nLABORATORY EVALUATION:  Her initial enzymes were flat. \nTHERAPY RENDERED/COURSE IN ED:  She is being taken to the Cardiac \nCatheterization Laboratory for an urgent study to rule out acute \ncoronary syndrome. \nFINAL DIAGNOSIS:  Rule out unstable angina. \nDISPOSITION (including condition upon discharge):  The patient is \ntaken to the Cardiac Catheterization Laboratory.  The condition at \nthe time of this dictation is favorable. \n___________________________________                    FK981/1979 \nRONNIE PALMER, M.D.  RP400                           D:10/05/75 \n                                                       T:10/05/75 \nDictated by:  RONNIE PALMER, M.D.  RP400 \n ******** Not reviewed by Attending Physician ********\nRecord date: 2076-12-11\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nDecember 11, 2076\n \n \nPaul Arteaga, M.D.\n677 Mill Street\nShady Cove, NY 43414\n \nRe:  Christine Olivier\n     MR #652-33-21-5\n \nDear Dr. Arteaga:\n \nMrs. Olivier returns for follow-up.  Since last seen, she reports\nreturn in a non-exertional left shoulder discomfort syndrome,\noccasionally associated with mild dyspnea.  Of note, she underwent\na dobutamine MIBI stress test last June for evaluating a similar\nsyndrome, and at that time she developed her typical chest and left\nback pain syndrome in association with no diagnostic EKG changes at\na peak heart rate of 127, peak blood pressure of 160/60.  A\nsimultaneously obtained SESTA MIBI scan revealed a global left\nventricular fraction of 42%, a non-Q-wave myocardial infarction\ninvolving 2 out of 20 segments of the inferior wall and minimal\nperi-infarct ischemia.  In addition, a venous duplex ultrasound\nstudy done to evaluate her severe left greater than right\nperipheral edema showed no evidence of DVT.  \n \nCurrently she remains on a regimen of amlodipine 5 mg poqd,\natenolol 50 mg poqd, simvastatin 10 mg poqd, lisinopril 10 mg poqd,\nNitropatch .4 mg q.12 hours, Neurontin 400 mg potid, furosemide 40\nmg poqd (recently increased), Lamactil 150 mg pobid, Trusopt and\nXalantan drops, insulin 10 units of CZI with 72 units NPH qam and\n74 units NPH qpm. \n \nPhysical exam reveals an overweight woman in no distress.  Blood\npressure, right arm sitting - 110/70, heart rate - 70 and regular,\nrespirations - 12 and unlabored, weight - 174 pounds which is four\npounds below her weight of six months ago.  The neck is supple with\nJVP flat.  Carotids are 2+ without significant bruits.  Chest is\nclear.  Cardiac exam shows normal S1, physiologically split S2, and\na I/VI holosystolic murmur radiating from the apex to the axilla. \nNo significant diastolic murmur or rub.  The abdomen is benign. \nExtremities reveal marked left greater than right pedal edema. \nPeripheral pulses are diminished.  \n \nElectrocardiogram shows sinus rhythm at a rate of 70, PR interval\nof .12, QRS of .06, QT of .36, axis of -25.  There is borderline\nPaul Arteaga, M.D.\nDecember 11, 2076\nPage Two\n \nRe:  Christine Olivier\n     MR #652-33-21-5\n \n \nevidence for left ventricular hypertrophy with secondary ST and T-\nwave changes.  Compared with the last electrocardiogram, there has\nbeen no significant change. \n \nPresently, Mrs. Olivier has evidence of continuing chest and left\nshoulder discomfort which she believes is similar to her pre-bypass\nsurgery angina.  In this setting, a dobutamine stress test\nperformed last June showed no evidence of provokable ischemia.  I\nhave spent some time discussing with Ms. Olivier our various\ntherapeutic and diagnostic options.  She made it quite clear that\nshe would not consider repeat cardiac catheterization at this time,\nand furthermore, was very disinterested in pursuing the possibility\n(should she require it) of either mechanical or surgical re-\nvascularization.  It is not entirely clear to me that her left\nshoulder syndrome is in fact ischemic in origin, and she certainly\nunderstands it may be secondary to musculoskeletal abnormalities. \nI have suggested that she discuss that further with you.  In the\nmeantime, I have asked her (as her back and chest discomfort\nsyndrome appears to occur mostly at night prior to lying down for\nbed) to apply her Nitropatch in the evening and take it off in the\nmorning.  She will call me within the next several days to report\nhow this helps her discomfort syndrome.  I do not believe that she\nis having GERD to explain her symptoms.  In light of her reluctance\nto undergo any further diagnostic cardiac studies, I will try to\ntailor her anti-ischemic medications to minimize her chest\ndiscomfort syndrome.  I, of course, will keep you fully informed as\nto her progress, and I thank you for allowing me to assist in her\ncare. \n \nSincerely yours,\n \n \nIrineo Tovar, M.D.\n/vuong\n \nDD: 12/11/76\nDT: 01/14/77\nDV: 12/11/76\n \n ******** Not reviewed by Attending Physician ********"}

I hope you are doing well.  I am writing to let you know about your recent test results.  \n\n\n\n\n\nThe following tests were essentially negative, normal, or unchanged from prior testing and do not require follow-up at this time.\n\n1) Kidney test.\n\n2) Cholesterol.  Your cholesterol results are as follows:\n\n     Total Cholesterol = 129,\n\n     HDL (the 'good' cholesterol) = 43,\n\n     LDL (the 'bad' cholesterol) = 70,\n\n     triglycerides = 82.\n\nMy records indicate that your total cholesterol has increased since 01/11/2072.  Given your medical history, we would like to keep your LDL (the 'bad' cholesterol) below 100.  Please continue to follow a heart-healthy diet.\n\n3) Hemoglobin A1c.  This is a blood test that indicates how well you have controlled your blood sugar over the past 3 months.  For patients with diabetes, we would like to keep it below 7.  Your Hemoglobin A1c value was 6.5 on 04/04/2073.  It has remained stable compared to the last value of 6.5 on 07/12/2072.  Please continue to check your sugars regularly and take Metformin as prescribed.\n\n4) X-ray.  No fractures were detected on the X-ray of your spine, but it did show changes consistent with osteoarthritis.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe following tests were abnormal or require follow-up.\n\n1) PSA.  As we discussed during our visit, this is a blood test that measures activity in your prostate, and is one way to measure your potential risk of prostate cancer.  This is not a perfect test, and its use for prostate cancer screening is controversial.  My records indicate that your PSA has mildly increased since 4/01/72.  I recommend that you follow-up with a urologist for a prostate biopsy, which we can arrange when you return for your follow-up appointment.  At that time, we will again discuss the specifics of the PSA test and the risks/benefits of different treatment/follow-up options.\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you have any questions, please do not hesitate to reach me at my office at 191-537-1871.  I will see you on 5/16/73 at 9:40am for our next appointment.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n_____________________________________________\n\nBailey Bray, M.D.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n______________________________                              \n\n\n\nBailey Bray, M.D.\nRecord date: 2074-04-02\n\n                                                       Patient Name: LOUIS,ROBERT [ MRN: 85588852LGH ]\n\n                                                         Date of Visit: 04/02/2074\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHistory of Present Illness\t\n\n*H&P conducted with interpreter present.\n\n\n\n70M DM, HTN, CAD, CHF (CAD vs EtOH), COPD, elevated PSA, here for routine follow-up appointment.  \n\n\n\n1) R>L groin/testicular/buttock pain x1mo.

Hypertension.  The patient's atenolol was recently decreased from 50 mg to 25 mg because of bradycardia and lisinopril was increased to 60 mg because of microalbuminuria.  The patient's heart rate is appropriate at 64 even though his blood pressure remains borderline elevated.  We will check a microalbumin today.\n\n4.  Recent TSH was mildly suppressed and we will repeat this today.\n\n5.  Regular healthcare maintenance.

He was admitted on 07/23/2082, one month after previous admission for abdominal pain.  In retrospect, that admission may have been related in part to GI symptoms of heart failure.  He came in complaining of continued GI discomfort, orthopnea, lower extremity edema, and 9 pounds of weight gain with increasing abdominal girth.  His medications at the time of admission included beta-blockers and ACE inhibitors for hypertension, with no diuretics.\n\n\n\nDuring his hospitalization, he underwent 7.5 kilograms of diuresis with resolution of his jugular venous pressure from approximately 25 cm to 8 cm.  His echocardiogram showed an ejection fraction of approximately 20% with LV dimension of 5.1, enlarged right ventricle with mild decrease in RV function, but severe RV pressure overload with estimated PA pressure 80 plus the right atrial pressure.  After he had his diuresis, he underwent right heart catheterization, which revealed a right atrial pressure of 8, pulmonary capillary wedge pressure of 18, PA pressure of 65/35.  He underwent a trial with IV nitroglycerin, then with sildenafil.  The IV nitroglycerin decreased his BLANK pressures only by approximately 8-10 mm but he noted a further improvement in his dyspnea.  There was no clear improvement with the sildenafil in either his symptoms or hemodynamics.  His cardiac output varied between 3.1 and 4.5 on all the medications.  The decision was just to put him on oral nitroglycerin in addition to the other standard heart failure medications.  He also underwent a MIBI looking for any evidence of active ischemia, which there was none.\n\n\n\nAt the time of discharge, he is walking easily without postural change or symptoms.  His medications are Isordil 10 t.i.d., Lasix 40 mg p.o. b.i.d.  He is on Toprol-XL 12.5 daily.  His lisinopril was decreased from 40 mg to 20 mg, but should he have any problems with hypotension, this could certainly be decreased further to 10 or even 5 mg if necessary to allow him comfortable ambulation.  He is on Plavix 75 mg daily as well and simvastatin 40.  His discharge blood pressure is 102/60, jugular venous pressure is 8-9 cm.  His creatinine is 1.3 with a BUN of 44, hematocrit 40, white blood count 5000, potassium 3.9, sodium 139.\n\n\n\nIt has been my great pleasure to participate in his care.  He is trying very hard to learn how to manage his disease at home, with the help of his family.  We have emphasized not only the salt restriction but also a fluid restriction to 2 liters a day, which includes all fluids,   We would encourage him to resume his daily exercise such as walking.  He has an appointment to see Dr. Anderson on 08/20/2081, and is looking forward to returning to your care. \n\n\n\n I would be happy to answer any further questions about it.\n\n\n\nSincerely,\n\n\n\n\n\n______________________________\n\nUrsula Michael Troyer, MD\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\neScription document:3-8959007 IFFocus\n\n\n\nCC: Forrest T.

Valladares, M.D.\n\nMedical Director\n\nJanuary 27, 2089\n\n\n\nMedical Record Number:  8751045  Francisco, Xue\n\n\n\nProcedure:  The patient is a 56-year-old Spanish-speaking female scheduled for laparoscopic cholecystectomy.  Surgery is scheduled on January 28, 2089 by Dr. Xavier Israel kenneth Xenos.\n\n\n\nChief Complaint & Present Illness:  Patient briefly evaluated on 12/30/88 as part of preoperative evaluation for a laparoscopic cholecystectomy then scheduled for 12/31/88.  Over the past year patient has had difficulty with right upper quadrant pain as well as epigastric pain.  These episodes tend to happen more frequently after she has had a rich meal.  Other symptoms that occurred include nausea and vomiting.  Patient denies jaundice.  Today, patient states that she still has some abdominal tenderness greatest at the right costal margin and radiating into right flank.\n\n\n\nAt the time of evaluation on 12/30/88 patients had symptoms of URI and LRI.  She reported back/green sputum, mild shortness of breath and increased use of her grandson's inhaler.  After consultation with Dr. Valladares it was decided that patient should be evaluated by her primary care provider for further treatment of her respiratory tract infection and then follow-up with surgeon to reschedule her surgery.  Patient reports that she went to University Hospital and there they treated her with antibiotics and inhaler.  Unfortunately patient is unable to recall the name of the antibiotic or the inhaler.  Currently she denies any symptoms of sputum production, cough, shortness of breath, or wheezing.  Also denies fever, chills, nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea.\n\n\n\nPatient does have a history of coronary artery disease.  She is status post an MI 11/82.  Patient had cardiac catheterization at OSH 12/3/82 that reportedly showed a critical mid right lesion and a mild left main and left anterior descending lesion.  12/09/82 patient underwent cardiac catheterization at PVH and a PTCA was done.  Patient did well until 10/83 when she was admitted to PVH with symptoms of chest tenderness, left arm pain, tachycardia, palpitations, diaphoresis, dry mouth, shortness of breath, dizziness, and darkening of revision.  Patient did rule out for MI by serial enzymes and there are no changes seen on her ECG.  Patient denies any difficulty with chest pain or left arm pain since that time.

Pt reported that pain has been lasting anywhere from 20 min to 1 hour and that it emanates from the L sternal border with radiation to L lateral thorax and radiation to L arm, accompanied by tingling/numbness in L digits + occasionally right digits, as well as down the L leg. In PVH ED, pt describes the pain as    like a bleeding scar    and states    my heart is bloated    through her daughter who acted as her interpreter.  She reports that the pain, at it's worst is 5/10, but has improved to 2/10 after NTG en route to the ED and once in the ED.  She affirms nausea and diaphoresis accompany pain. Pain has no relationship to position or activity -- has occurred during sitting, ambulation, and reclining. Pt lives on the second story of her building and has noted that walking up stairs has been been more difficult over the past two weeks secondary to calf and ankle pain, L > R, follow by chest pain.  Pt has not had to use more pillows in the past two weeks when sleeping, and reports no change in the number of times per week that she wakes up short of breath, which varies between one to two times per week.  Pt denies increased swelling in extremities over the past two weeks or increase in weight.\n\n\n\nAllergies\n\n      * Celebrex    - SOB : \"that triggered her asthma\"\n\n\n\nMedications\n\n      Aspirin (ACETYLSALICYLIC Acid)    81 MG,  1 Tablet(s)  PO QD\n\n      Calcium Gluconate    500MG,  2 Tablet(s)  PO x1\n\n      Vitamin D (ERGOCALCIFEROL)      PO QD\n\n      Nitroglycerin 1/150 (0.4 Mg)    1 TAB SL  : PRN\n\n      Vioxx (ROFECOXIB)    25MG,  1 Tablet(s)  PO QD PRN leg pain\n\n      Nifedipine (EXTENDED Release)    90MG,  1 Tablet(s)  PO QD\n\n      HYDROXYCHLOROQUINE   200MG,  1 Tablet(s)  PO BID x 30 day(s)\n\n      ATENOLOL   50MG,  1 Tablet(s)  PO QD\n\n      Protonix (PANTOPRAZOLE)    40MG,  1 Tablet(s)  PO QD x 30 day(s)\n\n      PREDNISONE   10MG,  1 Tablet(s)  PO QD x 30 day(s)\n\n      Isosorbide Dinitrate    30MG,  1 Tablet(s)  PO QD\n\n\n\nSocial History\n\n Pt originally from Hawley, Puerto Rico.

However, given pt's cardiac history, will obtain two more sets of cardiac markers.  Adenosine stress test scheduled for a.m. with echocardiogram pending, as well.  Pt's Atenenlol switched to Lopressor during admission.  Pt Dilatrate-SR changed to Isordil.    Continuing home meds of Nifedipine and ASA.  Pt to be NPO after midnight for am cardiac testing.\n\n\n\n2.\tSLE: Continuing home dose of prednisone, as well as Vitamins C and D.  Will notify Dr. Xie that pt is in-house per request of PCP, to determine if any further Rheum w/u is necessary.\n\n\n\n3.\tGI: Will repeat amylase and lipase.  Prednisone is a known cause of pancreatitis and pt's continued abdominal complaints may be pancreatic in origin. although unlikely as elevation is minimal.\n\n\n\n\n\nOlivia H.

CAD.\n\nPt had negative stress MIBI in 12/91 and has not had cardiology follow up for multiple years. She is being referred to the Internal Medicine ward service for consultation. Specifically, she remains on a nitrate (isordil) which may exacerbate GERD. She also merits being placed on an ACE inhibitor to prevent reinfarction.\n\nShe is well beta blocked and her BP is well controlled by the current regimen of atneolol and isordil.\n\nChecking fasting lipids.\n\n3. SLE.\n\nShe is being followed by Dr. Xie.\n\nShe and I are curious about her prednisone dosing and I will discuss the regimen with Dr. Xie. \n\n4. Prednisone.\n\nHad BD of hip last year which was negative; continues on calcium/vitamin D.\n\nNeeds further monitoring of HgbA1C as elevated from prior measurements and hyperglycemic from steroids.\n\n5. Mammogram.\n\nOrdered this visit for routine HCM.\n\n6. Pain control.\n\nShe has multiple complaints of chronic pain which are not documented in this note. She has used Vioxx previously and needs Stuart Hospital authorization which is being sought following this visit.\n\n7. GERD. \n\nWell-controlled with new regimen of Protonix 40 BID.\n\n8. LE dysesthesias.\n\nRemeasuring A1C but unlikely to have microvascular complications without overt DM.\n\nStarting amitriptyline.

Hood, M.D.\n\n\n\nAttending note:\n\nPt seen and discussed with Dr. Hood, and agree with his evaluation and plan.\n\nPt with symptoms and signs of impingement syndrome due to rotator cuff tendinitis vs partial tear, and also tenderness and positive cross-over test c/w A-C arthritis. Will check X-ray, get PA for Vioxx, and would benefit from PT referral. If no improvement, consider MRI vs empiric subacromial/?A-C joint steroid injection.\n\nSeems to have a painful peripheral neuropathy, cause uncertain. Will try low-dose TCA, would also check B12, consider EMG/NCV.\n\nWill obtain cardiology review for CAD. Regardless of level of lipids, there is evidence for benefit of statin, and would encourage pt to resume. If current chest pain syndrome more likely due to GERD than ischemia, could consider D/C nitrates.\nRecord date: 2093-01-28\n\n\n\nProblems\n\n      Health maintenance\n\n      Depression    : Per daughter, depression significant component of back pain.

In brief, the patient is a 81 y/o man with CRI, Type II DM and hypertension who was in his USOH until Thursday evening, when he developed substernal chest pain around 7pm, associated with dyspnea, but no  radiation diaphoresis, nausea, vomiting.  The pain lasted approximately 15-20 minutes.  EMS was called, who brought him to the HCC ED, where he was found to be tachypneic, with an O2 of 85%.  His pain was alleviated with IV NTG, and BiPap improved his O2 saturation.  He was found to have an interventricular conduction delay and a positive troponin.  He was begun on aspirin, lopressor, lasix, heparin, and integrelin and sent to the cath lab, where he was found to have 3-vessel disease not amenable to percutaneous interventions.  He was sent to the SDU, where he was started on lasix 60IV BID and a CABG pre-op workup was begun.  Since admission to the SDU, he has been stable, with excellent RA sats.  His Troponin-T peaked at 2.91 and was slow to return to normal, 2.65 on last draw today. He was diuresed aggressively and transferred to the floor with no oxygen requirement, having no chest pain.\n\tOn the floor, he was stable but had a 15-beat self-limited run of MMVT, his BP was 110/60 and he was asymptomatic, with no chest pain or dyspnea.  He was given 4 gm iv of MgSO4, 60 mEq of KCL.  Repeat cardiac enzymes drawn at the time were significant for a troponin-T of 3.73 but with a CK of 133 (303) and CK-MB of 5.2 (16.2).  \n\nPast Medical History:   \nCAD\nCHF- EF 38% on TTE on 3/24/64\nHTN-Took Lisinopril before admission\nDMII-Takes Glyburide before admission\nCRI- Baseline Pcr is between 1.6-1.8\n\nMedications on transfer:\nLopressor 12.5 mg PO BID\nCaptopril 6.25 mg PO BID\nLipitor 80 mg PO qd\nZantac 50 mg IV q12h\nColace 100 mg PO TID\nInsulin SS\nASA 325 mg PO QD\nLasix 60 mg IV QD\nHeparin IV SS \n\nALL:  NKDA\nSH: Patient quit tobacco 30 years ago, smoked 2 ppd x 34 yrs.

As you know, this is an 81 year-old man with a history of chronic renal insufficiency and diabetes.  He underwent an off-pump double bypass on 3/31/64.  He had an excellent post-operative recovery being discharged on day five.  Since home, he reports having no further symptoms of shortness of breath or chest pain.  He has been gradually increasing his daily activity and is now walking about five to ten minutes a day and two flights of steps.  I have suggested that he gradually increase his daily exercise.\n\n\n\nOn examination today his heart rate was 80 and regular.  His chest incision was well healed and his sternum stable.  His lungs were clear bilaterally.  He had mild edema at his right ankle and a well-healed endoscopic vein harvest site.  His current medications are aspirin 325 a day, Nexium 20 a day, Lisinopril 2.5 a day, Atenolol 25 a day, Plavix 75 a day, Glimepiride 1 mg. PO b.i.d., and Lipitor 80 mg. a day.\n\n\n\nOverall, I am obviously delighted to see Mr. Isenberg having recovered without complication from his revascularization.  I trust that you have received a copy of his Discharge Summary previously.  If not please let me know and we   ll forward you this.  Thanks for letting us participate in the care of this pleasant gentleman and let me know if I can be of further assistance.\n\n\n\nSincerely,\n\n\n\n\n\nIan K.

He recently underwent a two vessel CABG in April 2064. At that time he had presented to HCC in CHF and w/ an NSTEMI. Cardiac catheterization revealed severe disease in the LAD and LCx territory and moderate disease in the RCA. He underwent CABG on 03/31/2064, off-pump, w/ a LIMA to the LAD graft and an SVG to the circumflex OM. His post-operative course was uncomplicated.\nHe presented to DSH on 8/14 w/ SOB, found to be in CHF (BNP 482). He denies any chest pain and at DSH he had no ischemic EKG changes but was found to have positive cardiac biomarker w/ an initial TnI of 0.6 rising to 23.8 o/n. His biomarkers continue to rise and on transfer were CK 745 and CK-MB of 80.3 with a fraction of 10.7%. He was transferred to HCC where he underwent cardiac catheterization that demonstrated continued severe disease in his native vessels as well as significant stenosis of his LIMA at its touch-down and complete occlusion of his SVG. A PA line and an IABP were placed and the patient was transferred to the CCU for further management.\n\nPMH / PSH:\nCAD     S/p  2-V CABG off pump in 4/64\nCHF- EF 38%, mild MR, diffusely hypokinetic LV w/ apical aneurysm, RVSP 46mmHg, upper \nsegment septal hypertrophy w/o evidence of obstruction on TTE on 3/24/64\nHTN\nHyperlipidemia\nDMII\nCRI- Baseline Pcr is between 1.6-1.8\n\nMedications: \nPlavix 75 mg qd\nAspirin 325 mg qd\nLipitor 80 mg qd\nLisinopril 2.5 mg qd\nAtenolol 25 mg qd\nFluoxetine 10 mg qd\n\nAllergies: NKDA\n\nFHx: Mr. Isenberg   s father died at 63, and his mother at 69, neither from cardiac causes.

Duplex ultrasonography after compression showed no evidence of a pseudoaneurysm. A CTA done yesterday to evaluate his thyroid was  read as: \n\n\n\n\" Hematoma around right subclavian artery.  Narrowing of the artery. Apparent filling defect, most likely artifactual.  If thrombus is of clinical concern, upper extremity ultrasound may be obtained.\"\n\n\n\nOn physical examination, he has mild non expansile hematoma of the right chest wall. His right hand is warm and well perfused, with 1+ radial and brachial pulses. There are no thrills or bruits.\n\n\n\nMy review of arterial components of the CT show the following:\n\n1). Hematoma- to be expected\n\n2). Diffuse arterial calcifications- obscures the ability to read what is or is not in the lumen.\n\n3). Venous contrast bolus delivered on the right side- obscures our ability to discern the anatomy in the area of the subclavian artery.\n\n4). Contrast bolus inadequate to comment on arterial anatomy.\n\n\n\nBased on his clinical exam, and the fact that he is on an anticoagulant, a follow up subclavian artery ultrasound examination is in order. This test should be geared towards determining whether there is any evidence of a pseudoaneurysm. If there is an intraarterial filling defect, I would not pursue it. He is anticoagulated and his arm is viable. There are no stigmata of atheroemboli.\n\n\n\n\n\nUriel A. Xavier, MD"}

I will review his history for you.  Mr. Nielson is a 76-year-old gentleman who states that approximately three months ago, he had some increased swelling of his left leg.  About three to four weeks ago, this became increasingly evident and the patient was evaluated at Elders Home in Brandon, Indiana.  At that point, a CT scan was performed.  CT scan of the abdomen revealed significant adenopathy in the retroperitoneal space with a 2.0 cm node between the IVC in aorta and a 1.5 cm node just posterior to that, also a 1.0 cm retrocrural node was seen.  CT scan of the pelvis performed on the same day revealed a chain of retrocrural nodes in front of the aorta and vena cava extending to about 2.0 to 3.0 cm below the bifurcation as well as bulky adenopathy in the external iliac chain with an iliac mass measuring 3.0 to 3.5 cm in diameter on the left side.  The largest node in the inguinal area measures approximately 6.0 cm in diameter.  The patient was then seen by Dr. Lopez on April 12th who noted firm edema in the left leg and referred him to me for evaluation.\n\n\n\nPAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  \n\n\n\nWegener s granulomatosis initially diagnosed in 2083.  The patient says at that point he came to the Hilton Head Medical Center with severe photophobia and was diagnosed with scleritis.  This recurred in 2093.  He has been treated intermittently with low-dose azathioprine and steroids.  He is currently on a minimal dose of steroids.  \n\nstatus post bilateral knee repair\n\nstatus post right-sided hip repair\n\nhistory of diabetes mellitus type II\n\nhiatal hernia\n\nhistory of asbestos exposure\n\ncoronary artery disease\n\nrenal transplant donor s/p left nephrectomy in the 2060s\n\n\n\nCURRENT MEDICATIONS:  \n\n\n\nMicronase 10 mg po q day, Lipitor 10 mg po q day, Lasix 40 mg po q day, multivitamin, prednisone 5 mg po q day, Tylenol PM qhs and the patient is currently off of aspirin.\n\n\n\nALLERGIES:  \n\n\n\nNo known drug allergies.  No food allergies.\n\n\n\nREVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  \n\n\n\nThe patient denies fevers or night sweats.  Does report 30 to 40-pound weight loss over the last year.  Reports increasing fatigue for the last year.  Denies heat or cold intolerance.  Reports his vision has been progressively worse, especially his near vision over the last six to eight months.  His hearing is quite poor especially in his left ear, however has not changed recently.  Has had no effect of sense of smell for the last many years.  Denies trouble chewing or swallowing but does gag when he drinks water intermittently. Denies wheezing.  Does report an intermittent dry cough secondary to nasal drip for the last two weeks.  Reports a runny nose for the last two weeks.  Increase in shortness of breath over the last month.  No muscle pain or muscle aches.  Denies chest pain.  Does report a sensation of burning pressure over his chest lasting approximately 4 to 5 minutes at a time, with exertion, this happens at least once a week, sometimes twice a week, it resolves quickly when he rests.  Denies palpitations.  Does report that he has been bruising more easily over the last several months.  No abdominal pain, nausea or vomiting.  Intermittent constipation.  No diarrhea.  No weakness, numbness or changes in his mood or affect.\n\n\n\nSOCIAL HISTORY:  \n\n\n\nThe patient lives at home in Bisbee, Indiana with his wife.  His wife is wheelchair bound and he is her sole caregiver.  He has four sons and two daughters.  He has grandchildren, four boys and four girls.  The patient was the long time Chief of Security for Cisco.  This job is currently held by his son.  He smoked about a pack a day from age 14 to age 50 quitting about 26 years ago.  Did drink significantly in the past, but usually only on the weekends, but did not drink everyday.\n\n\n\nFAMILY HISTORY:  \n\n\n\nThe patient s father had colon cancer, which was apparently cured and died at age 87 of old age.  The patient s mother had breast cancer, which was cured and died at age 89 of old age.  The patient s brother had some sort of new cancer in his armpit; the exact histology is unknown.\n\n\n\nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  \n\n\n\nWeight of 268 pounds, temperature of 97.5, blood pressure of 140/82, pulse of 84 and respiratory rate of 20.  General:  A well-appearing, well-developed gentleman in no apparent distress accompanied by his son today.  Head is normocephalic and atraumatic, thinning head of grey hair.  Pupils are equal round and reactive to light and accommodation.  Extraocular muscles are intact.  Oropharynx is moist.  No mucositis, pharyngitis, thrush or increased lymphoid tissue is seen.  The patient has a scar in the inside of his left buccal mucosa.  He has numerous actinic keratoses over his scalp and behind his left ear.  Otherwise, skin reveals no jaundice, rash or suspicious lesions.  Tongue is midline and well papillated.  The patient has a hearing aid in his right ear.  Neck is supple and somewhat full.  No jugular venous distention or thyromegaly is visible.  Lungs:  Slightly decreased breath sounds throughout and clear to auscultation.  No wheezes, rales or rhonchi.  Back:  No costovertebral angle or vertebral body tenderness.  There is a very old healed scar in the left posterior flank consistent with prior nephrectomy.  Heart:  Soft systolic ejection murmur, no gallops or rubs, intermittent skipped beats, otherwise regular rate and rhythm, S1 and S2 normal.  Abdomen is obese, soft, nontender and nondistended.  Positive bowel sounds.  No hepatosplenomegaly is palpable.  Extremities:  2+ edema on the right and 3+ on the left, pitting.  Lymph node exam:  No anterior or posterior auricular, no anterior or posterior cervical, no submandibular, submental, infraclavicular or supraclavicular lymphadenopathy.  The patient has a 1.0 cm lymph node deep in the right axilla.  No epitrochlear lymphadenopathy.  Inguinal region:  A 4.0 to 5.0 cm left inguinal lymph node mass is palpated.  Neurologic exam:  Cranial nerves II through XII intact to specific examination.  Strength 5-/5, bilateral grip, bicep, triceps, deltoids, knee flexion and extension.  Sensory exam intact to light touch bilateral upper extremities and decreased sensation to light touch in the left lower extremity.\n\n\n\nLABORATORY STUDIES:  \n\n\n\nRecent laboratory values from April 12th reveals a creatinine of 1.5, glucose of 244 and calcium of 11.  Liver function tests are within normal limits.  Hemoglobin A1c is 6.  White count of 5.2, hematocrit of 33.9 with an MCV of 81 and a platelet count of 155,000.\n\n\n\nIMAGING STUDIES:  \n\n\n\nThe patient has a PET/CT scan which was performed this morning and has not been read.  To my initial evaluation, there is notable PET avid lymphadenopathy both in the retroperitoneal space as well as in the left inguinal region.\n\n\n\nASSESSMENT AND PLAN:  \n\n\n\n1.  Mr. Danny Nielson is a 76-year-old gentleman with notable lymphadenopathy both by report from the outside hospital as well as by my initial evaluation of his CT scan from Mount Ascutney Hospital.  This is very likely to be consistent with lymphoma.  I discussed lymphoma in general terms with the patient and his son.  I informed them that many lymphomas were treatable and some of them would indeed be curable.  This would all depend on the exact histology that was revealed by biopsy.  These sites of biopsy would be the left inguinal region.  I informed them that the treatments that would be considered would include either antibodies, chemotherapy or radiation and these would depend significantly on the type of lymphoma that was found.  The fact that there are no B symptoms and that he feels relatively well might indicate that this is a low-grade lymphoma.  However, the relatively rapid onset of his leg swelling in the left leg may be more consistent with a higher-grade process.  I feel that his left-sided edema is very likely due to decreased lymphatic drainage from the left leg.  However, further discussion of his lymphoma will have to wait final pathology.  I introduced the patient to Dr. Victor Ashley who is scheduled to perform a core needle lymph node biopsy later this afternoon.\n\n2.  Cardiovascular:  I am very concerned about the patient s history of intermittent burning chest pressure.  If he will be diagnosed with an aggressive lymphoma and will need anthracycline, it would be important to have Cardiology on board.  He has a significant murmur and his symptoma are suggestive of angina.  The patient will be evaluated by Dr. Square Turk later this week.  In follow-up, Mr. Nielson will see me back in clinic next Sunday six days from now.  At that point, we should have a firm and final biopsy report in hand and the staging studies also have been completed.  At that point, we will be able to discuss therapy in a meaningful way.  The patient will call me back if problems arise in the meantime.\n\n\n\nSincerely,\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGene Quadri, M.D.\n\n\n\n\n\nGQ/NV/whalen/whalen\t\t28-39407838.doc\nRecord date: 2097-08-28\n\n \n\n\n\nINTERN/MED STUDENT ADMIT NOTE, Team 3\n\n\n\n\n\nName:  Mr. Danny Nielson\n\nMR #:  9156593\n\nDate of admission: 08/28/2097\n\nAdmitting Physician: Dr. Gene Quadri, MD\t\n\nPCP: Dr. Ulises Noel\n\nSource of Hx:  Patient, Available note\n\nCode: Full\n\n          \n\nCC:     Want to get my chemo   \n\n\n\nID: Mr. Nielson is a 77 yoM w/ Stage IIIB diffuse large B-cell lymphoma s/p 4 cycles of CHOP and 1 cycle of R-ICE who presents now for cycle 2 of R-ICE.  \n\n\n\nHPI:   Mr. Nielson was in his usual state of health until March of this year when he began noticing increasing swelling in his left leg over a period of three weeks.  He also developed b/l groin swelling greater on the left; the swelling in the left groin was tender.  He presented in early April where CT and PET scan of the pelvis and abdomen revealed a 6.0 cm inguinal node, a chain of nodes in the retrocrural space, adenopathy in the external iliac chain (largest 3.5 cm), and two nodes in the retroperitoneal space in between the IVC and aorta.  He underwent biopsy of the left groin mass two weeks later revealing DLBCL confimed by immunophenotyping.  Subsequent bone marrow biopsy revealed polyclonal B-cell populations and an inverted CD4/CD8 T Cell ratio, with no evidence of monoclonal proliferation.  The patient underwent his initial two cycles of CHOP in May, and experienced no adverse effects except for generalized weakness.  PET exam in early June revealed larger left groin mass, improvement in lymphadenopathy, and a small pancreatic cystic lesion.  It was undetermined whether this represented treatment effect or worsening of disease.  \n\n\n\nThe patient subsequently had his next two CHOP treatments in mid June and early July.  PET scan and lymph node biopsy in early July revealed unchanged disease with evidence of fibrosis and inflammation.  The patient was seen in clinic by Dr. Quadri twice in July, with the second visit revealing increased PET avidity and persistence of the primary mass.  Given the persistence of the mass and lack of response to CHOP, the patient was evaluated by Dr. Rodgers of the WDMC one week later on 7/28 for consideration of auto-SCT vs more aggressive chemo regimen.  Due to the patient's age and consideration of risk/benefit, it was decided that the best approach would be to attempt a more aggressive chemo regimen first.  Mr. Nielson was admitted on 8/2/2097 to receive his first cycle of R-ICE with dose-reduced Ifos and carboplatin becuase of h/o nephrectomy.  He tolerated the treatment fairly well with some panycytopenia.  Patient felt the R-ICE regimen was a little    harder    on him than the CHOP regimen.  He felt effects including fatigue and constipation that resolved back to baseline in a few days.  On 8/9, he was given 2 units of packed red cells due to anemia and on 8/16, he was given a unit of pheresis platelets for his thrombocytopenia as well as two units of packed red blood cells for his anemia.  He was initially scheduled to receive cycle 2 of R-ICE on 8/22 but that was delayed due to his thrombocytopenia.  He says that he currently feels cold-intolerance and fatigue that is the same as when he first started his chemotherapy in May.  He denies any recent N/V, diarrhea, constipation, lightheadedness, orthostatic dizziness, hematuria, BRBPR, or melena.  Side effects of note from previous cycles of chemotherapy include generalized weakness, cold-intolerance, and constipation. \n\n\n\nPMH:\n\n1.

He underwent salvage with two cycles of R-ICE and unfortunately continued to have PET avidity in the area.  As a result, we scheduled him to begin therapy with Zevalin next Monday.  He is here for a follow up physical and count check to make sure he has adequate platelets for this immunotherapy.  \n\n\n\nINTERVAL HISTORY:\n\n\n\nHe describes an episode approximately one week ago of sudden onset of shortness of breath and tightness in his chest.  He sat down for approximately 10 minutes, it resolved, and has not recurred since then. However, we also have the reports of a follow up PET/CT scan which was performed yesterday which show a new accumulation of bilateral pleural effusions which the radiologist feels are most consistent with heart failure.  In addition, the scans also showe the prior area of PET avidity in the leg continues, although less avid. This area is in the medial compartment of the left thigh within the adductor muscles.  Mr. Nielson is not excited about this.  In addition, we also have results from laboratories today which show his platelets at 88,000, so  he is not eligible to begin Zevalin next week.  \n\n\n\nMEDICATIONS:  \n\n\n\nglyburide 10 mg \n\natorvastatin 10 mg daily\n\nfurosemide 40 mg daily\n\nmultiple vitamin daily\n\nprednisone 5 mg daily\n\nTylenol p.r.n.\n\nBactrim DS q. Sunday, Tuesday, Thursday\n\n\n\nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  \n\n\n\nWeight is 260 pounds, temperature is 97.1 degrees, heart rate is 120, blood pressure is 130/80, and respiratory rate is 20.  Pain index is 0/10.  Fatigue index is 5/10.  Heart rate is tachycardic with an ejection murmur and occasional missed beats.  Lungs do have reduced breath sounds bilaterally.  \n\n\n\nLABORATORY STUDIES:  \n\n\n\nWhite blood cell count is 3.2, hematocrit is 33.5, hemoglobin is 11.4, platelet count 88,000, neutrophil count is 2.45.  Chemistries examination reveals sodium of 141, potassium of 3, chloride of 104, carbon dioxide of 28.3, calcium of 9.1, BUN of 24, creatinine of 1.6, total protein 6.3, albumin of 3.7, total bilirubin of 0.8, alkaline phosphatase of 58, SGPT of 21, SGOT of 22, and LDH of 208.  \n\n\n\nASSESSMENT/PLAN:  \n\n\n\nGiven his current status, we have decided to transfer him to the emergency department today for further evaluation of his cardiac symptoms, particularly to rule out myocardial infarction and assess whether he is, indeed, in new heart failure  We attempted to contact cardiology for an outpatient evaluation, but we were unable to do so.Therefore, he will be transported to the emergency department for an emergent workup of his new symptoms.  I suspect he will be admitted.  Hopefully, they will be able to get his cardiac issues under control.  Unfortunately, from an oncologic point of view, it is uncertain whether his platelet count will reach at least 100,000 in order to give this man therapy.  As a potential other therapy, we will discuss the ability of radiation oncology to increase the number of cGy to that local area considering he only received 30 at the onset.  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdward Quiambao, PA-C\n\n\n\ncc:\tDr. Ulises Lopez, MAH\n\n\n\nEQ/sharpe\t\t39-90766020.doc\nRecord date: 2098-02-22\n\n\n\nKekela Team 3 Intern Admission\n\nName:  Danny Nielson\nMR#:  9156593\nAdmit Date: February 21, 2098\nOnc Attending:  Dr. Quadri\nOnc PA: Edward Quiambao\nPCP: Ulises Lopez\nAdmitting intern: Ulyssa Neff\nCode: FULL\n\nSource: Patient\n\nChief Complaint:  diarrhea\n\nHistory of Present Illness:  \n77-year-old gentleman with Stage IIIB diffuse large B-cell lymphoma s/p 4 cycles of CHOP-R with increased PET avidity of left groin nodal mass and biopsy c/w DLBCL then s/p R-ICE cycle #2.

The patient reports having a longstanding history of greater than four months of worsening pain, paresthesias, and \"numbness\" on the right worse than left hand.  This is worse at night and does occasionally wake him up from sleep.  Also bothers him during prolonged activity.  He also reports recently over the past few months noting difficulty with the key pinch, grasp, and fine motor function.  Previous evaluation consisted of cervical spine MRI as well as EMG nerve conduction studies demonstrating findings significant for severe compression neuropathy of the median nerve at the level of wrist.  He now comes for evaluation for potential carpal tunnel surgery release.   \nPAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Glucose intolerance, history of previous CVA, status post CABG, hypertension, GER.   \nMEDICATIONS:  Lopressor, Zocor, Ecotrin, Effexor, and Nexium.  \n \nALLERGIES:  None.  \n \nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  On examination today, he is very pleasant, well appearing in no apparent distress.  \nExamination of the right hand demonstrates marked thenar atrophy.  There is no active abductor pollicis brevis and \nvery weak opponens.  He has a positive Tinel's, positive Phalen's, and positive median nerve compression test at the wrist.  His interossei and extensors are full.  Sensation is intact throughout.  \n \nEMG studies from 11/09/2071, performed here at Folsom Convalescent Hospital, significant for right worse than left median nerve compression neuropathy at the wrists.   \nIMPRESSION:  The patient is seen and examined with Dr. Santiago.  At this time, we feel that Larry has indeed a significant, right worse than left, bilateral carpal tunnel syndrome.  Given the amount of weakness and thenar wasting, he has difficulty with abductor pollicis, we have recommended proceeding with both carpal tunnel release as well as \npossible FTS of ring finger to thumb tendon transfer.  We discussed with Larry the risks and benefits of this procedure and he is in agreement of the plan.  We will try to schedule him to proceed with surgery at some point in the near future.  We filled out both history and physical, as well as a surgical consent form today in the office.   \n__________________________ \nAndre-Israel Santiago, M.D.  \n \nCC:  \nStephen Mccullough, M.D.  \nFolsom Convalescent \nDictated by: _____ \n \nDD:11/20/2071 \nDT:11/22/2071 \nCH:18306     :0077\nRecord date: 2073-04-02\n\n\n\n\n\nINTERNAL MEDICINE ASSOCIATES\n\nFOLSOM CONVALESCENT HOSPITAL\n\n\n\nReason for visit   Annual examination.\n\n\n\nHistory of present illness   The patient has done very well over the last year.  He has maintained his weight, which has been quite difficult given the social commitments that he has.  He is requiring to eat out quite a bit.  He has also done a large amount of traveling over the last three to four months.  This caused him to be more exhausted than usual.  His incarcerated hernia repair has stood up.  He has some discomfort occasionally in that area, but for the most part feels that this is back to normal.  He is careful with his diet as much as he can be.  He had a cold over the last month or so.  It slowly resolved.

His cardiac risk management is doing fine.  His blood pressure is in good control.  His recent cholesterol profile is excellent.  He has slightly elevated fasting blood sugars.  We discussed options including diet and exercise which I think he has been very good on.  Discussed starting metformin based on recent data that this may help prevent his development of diabetes.  We will begin metformin 500 mg PO QD.  We will check his renal and liver function in one week and his bruising is likely due to his aspirin.  We need to follow up on a renal ultrasound for cysts that were discovered during his hernia operation, and I will make these arrangements.

He has reduced his exercise to three days a week-he exercises vigorously when he does exercise, but this seems to give him a little bit more in the way of stamina.\n\n\n\n\tPast medical history:\n\n   Noncontributory.\n\n\n\nCurrent Medications:\n\n  Nexium 40 mg BID\n\n Ecotrin 325 mg qd\n\n Toprol XL 50 mg qd\n\n Effexor 75 mg qam; Dir: and 37.5 mg qpm\n\n metformin hydrochloride 850 mg BID\n\n Zocor 40 mg; Dir: 4 days a week and 80 mg 3 days a week\n\n ranitidine HCl 300 mg qhs\n\n flaxseed oil; Dir: Gel\n\n vitamin b12 1 mg qd\n\n vitamin c\n\n Omega 1 tab tid; Dir: 3 fatty acids\n\n\n\n\tFamily history:\n\n   Noncontributory.\n\n\n\n\tSocial history:\n\n   He has four children and 10 grandchildren.  He just returned to Tunisia to visit family.  He does not smoke.  Minimal alcohol.  His wife recently had quite a bad fall.\n\n\n\n\tReview of systems:\n\n   Weight is stable.  No GI problems.  Otherwise negative.\n\n\n\nPhysical examination:\n\n\t\n\n-Pulse:   60\n\n-BP: 145/70    140-145/70\n\n-resp. rate:   16\n\n-General:   He looks great\n\n-Neck:   The jugular venous pressure was less than 5.  No carotid bruits.  No palpable lymph nodes\n\n-Chest:   The lungs were clear to percussion and auscultation\n\n-Cardiac:   Showed an S4.  Normal S1.  No murmurs\n\n-Abdomen:   Liver and spleen are not enlarged\n\n-Extremities:   Good femoral, popliteal, and pedal pulses\n\n\n\n\tEKG:\n\n    shows first-degree AV bock and minor ST and T changes.  No change from July 2075.\n\n\n\n\tAssessment and plan:\n\n   Mr.  Lilly is generally doing well.  His blood pressure is a little higher than it usually is in the office today, and we probably should have him on ACE inhibitor with his mild diabetes.  On the other hand, he is a little worked up over his wife's injury, and we will monitor his pressure.  For now, we will sit tight.  He will have a full battery of chemistries tomorrow-he sees Dr.  Mccullough, so far so good with respect to his cardiac sinus.  \n\n\n\nPlan: Monitor blood pressure.  Low threshold for starting an ACE inhibitor.  Chemistries tomorrow.  See again in six months.\n\n\n\nChanges to Medications this visit\n\n\t\n\nNexium 40 mg   BID\n\nEcotrin 325 mg   qd\n\nToprol XL 50 mg   qd\n\nEffexor 75 mg   qam and 37.5 mg qpm\n\nmetformin hydrochloride 850 mg   BID\n\nZocor 40 mg    4 days a week and 80 mg 3 days a week\n\nranitidine HCl 300 mg   qhs\n\nflaxseed oil     Gel\n\nvitamin b12 1 mg   qd\n\nvitamin c    \n\nOmega  1 tab  tid 3 fatty acidsCC:\n\n\tStephen N Mccullough M.D.\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\tSigned electronically by   Michael  Delarosa MD  on  Dec 15, 2075"}

Though you know her history well, I will\n\nrecount it for the purposes of record keeping.  Ms. Yerger is\n\npresently 81 years old.  Her vascular risk factors include\n\ndiabetes, hypertension, dyslipidemia.  She had no prior diagnosis\n\nof coronary disease until she presented in early October with flash\n\npulmonary edema after which she ruled in for a small non-ST\n\nelevation myocardial infarction.  Coronary angiography at the\n\nTitonka revealed complex diffuse disease of the proximal LAD,\n\nthrombotic lesion of the proximal circumflex with subsequent\n\ncomplete occlusion and a complex lesion of the first large marginal\n\nas well as a 70% osteal stenosis of a large PLV.  Angiography also\n\nrevealed a 90% left renal artery stenosis.  The patient underwent\n\nsubsequent successful stenting of her right renal artery followed\n\nby coronary artery bypass grafting by Dr. Susan Abreu.  (SVG to\n\nramus, OM2, RCA, and LIMA to LAD).  Ms. Yerger's postoperative\n\ncourse was notable for persistent pleural effusion and transient\n\nepisode of atrial fibrillation.  \n\n \n\nSince her discharge, she has been slowly increasing her level of\n\nactivity experiencing mild dyspnea on exertion while on extending\n\nshopping trips.  Overall, these symptoms have continued to improve. \n\nShe denies orthopnea, PND, or shortness of breath at rest.  She has\n\nhad persistent mild ankle edema on the site of her saphenous vein\n\ngraft harvesting.  She denies palpitations, presyncope, TIA, CVA\n\nsymptoms or claudication.  \n\n \n\nDetailed review of all other pertinent systems is negative.  Ms.\n\nYerger tells me that she has recently had an erythematous rash on\n\nher upper and lower extremities that you have been managing as a\n\npossible viral exanthem.  \n\nYerger, Urania\n\nMR #583-48-90-0               -2-            December 14, 2078\n\n \n\nPast medical history is notable for chronic renal insufficiency\n\n(baseline creatinine 2), vascular risk factors as delineated and\n\nprior right knee replacement.  \n\n \n\nHer current medications include enteric coated aspirin 325 mg po q.\n\nday, Lasix 40 mg po q. day, Glipizide 10 mg po q. day, Lisinopril\n\n5 mg po q. day, Lopressor 25 mg po t.i.d., atorvastatin 10 mg po q.\n\nday, Avandia, multivitamins, Protonix and Nystatin cream.\n\n \n\nSocial History:  The patient lives alone but has many family\n\nmembers in the area.  She is currently staying with her daughter. \n\nAt baseline, she has been able to ambulate slowly with a cane but\n\nis limited by chronic knee pain.  She denies alcohol or tobacco\n\nuse.  Her father died of a myocardial infarction at age 60.\n\n \n\nOn physical exam, Ms. Yerger looks extremely well today.  She is\n\ncomfortable seated on the exam table.  Her skin is warm and dry. \n\nShe has a diffuse erythematous macular papular rash predominantly\n\non her extremities.  Her blood pressure is 140/80, her heart rate\n\nis in the 70's.  She has no jugular venous distention.  Her\n\ncarotids are 2+ without bruits.  Her chest reveals decreased breath\n\nsounds at the left base.  There are no crackles or wheezes. \n\nCardiac exam reveals a nondisplaced PMI with regular rate and\n\nrhythm, S1, S2 and S4 is present and P2 is slightly increased. \n\nThere was a grade II/VI holosystolic murmur radiating toward the\n\napex.  Her abdomen is soft and nontender.  Her extremities are free\n\nof cyanosis or clubbing.  Distal pulses are 1+.  She has mild edema\n\nof the left lower extremity.\n\n \n\nHer ECG reveals sinus rhythm 79 beats per minute, normal axis and\n\nintervals, persistent deep anterior T wave inversions.\n\n \n\nOverall, Ms. Yerger continues on a steady course of recovery after\n\nher non-ST elevation MI and coronary artery bypass grafting in mid\n\nOctober.  Her persistent dyspnea on exertion may be related to\n\npersistent pleural effusion.  We will reevaluate today with a\n\nrepeat chest x-ray.  In the meantime, I think that we should\n\ncontinue her oral diuretic regimen.  It is possible that her\n\npersistent rash is related to her Lasix.  Although not certain to\n\nbe successful, we have made a change to Bumex 1 mg po q. day today\n\nin the hopes that if Lasix is responsible for her rash this may\n\nresolve.  I have made no other changes to her medical regimen.  We\n\nwill continue aspirin, beta blockade, ACE inhibition and statin for\n\nsecondary prevention.  I look forward to seeing her again in\n\napproximately eight to twelve weeks.  In addition, she will follow-\n\nup with Dr. Abreu for possible thoracentesis if she has a\n\npersistent pleural effusion that may be contributing to her\n\nsymptoms.\n\n \n\nYerger, Urania\n\nMR #583-48-90-0               -3-            December 14, 2078\n\n \n\nIt is a pleasure being involved in Ms. Yerger's care.

At her last visit her\nheart failure had improved, but she still was hypertensive.  We increased both her Losartan and\nher Toprol dosing.  Today her blood pressure is substantially improved.  She has generally been\nfeeling well.  She has continued to walk outside the home with her daughters, going shopping. \nShe denies orthopnea or PND.  She has had stable ankle edema.  \n\nHer current medications are aspirin 325 mg PO q. day, Lasix 40 mg PO q. day, Glipizide 10 mg\nPO q. day, Losartan 100 mg PO q. day, Toprol XL 100 mg PO q. day, Simvastatin 10 mg PO q.\nday, Avandia, and multivitamins.\n\nOn physical examination, her blood pressure today is 130/60.  Her heart rate is in the high 60s. \nShe is comfortable seated on the examination table.  Her jugular venous pressure is less than 8. \nHer chest examination has a few coarse crackles at the bases.  Cardiac examination reveals a\nnon-displaced PMI with normal intensity S1 and S2.  She has a grade II/VI holosystolic murmur\nat the apex and a grade II crescendo/decrescendo systolic murmur at the right upper sternal\nborder.  She has 1 - 2+ edema of both lower extremities and they are warm to touch.\n\nHer ECG reveals sinus rhythm at 68 beats per minute, normal axis and intervals.  There are\nnonspecific ST abnormalities.\n\nOverall, Ms. Yerger has improved significantly with better control of her blood pressure.  She\nhas signs of very mild volume overload on examination, with preserved perfusion.  We elected\nto maintain her present dosing, but discussed increasing her dose to 40 mg PO q. a.m. and 20 mg\nPO q. p.m. should her lower extremity edema increase or her weight rise.  \n\n\nUrania Yerger\nMR #583-48-90-0\nPage 2\nNovember 15, 2079\n\nI look forward to seeing her again in approximately six months.

Since increasing her Lasix dose approximately 12 months ago, she has had substantial improvement in her heart failure symptoms.  She continues to admit to fatigue and musculoskeletal pain as limiting her exertion, but no longer experiences significant dyspnea.  She denies orthopnea, PND, or ankle edema.\n\n\n\nHer current medications are aspirin 325 mg p.o. q.d., Lasix 60 mg p.o. q.d., glipizide 10 mg p.o. q.d., losartan 100 mg p.o. q.d., Toprol-XL 100 mg p.o. q.d., simvastatin 10 mg p.o. q.d., Avandia, and multivitamins.\n\n\n\nHer blood pressure today is 165/70 and her heart rate is in the low 60s.  She is comfortable seated on the exam table.  Her jugular venous pressure is approximately 8 cm with prominent V waves.  There are very rare crackles at the bases.  Cardiac exam reveals a nondisplaced PMI with regular rate and rhythm, normal intensity S1 and S2.  P2 is increased.  There is a grade 3/6 holosystolic murmur, loudest at the apex.  She has no edema of the extremities and they are warm to touch.\n\n\n\nHer ECG reveals sinus rhythm with normal axis intervals.  There is nonspecific ST abnormality, unchanged from her tracing in August.\n\n\n\nIn summary, Ms. Yerger remains free of recurrent angina or heart failure symptoms.  She does have evident persistent elevated right cardiac pressures on exam that may be related to her underlying pulmonary disease.  In light of her systolic hypertension, we increased her Toprol to 150 mg p.o. q.d.  She will have her blood pressure checked in the coming week and call the result to me.\n\n\n\nI look forward to seeing her again in approximately six months.  It remains a pleasure being involved in this delightful woman's care.\n\n\n\nSincerely yours,\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n______________________________\n\nVaughn A.

She had follow-up with her orthopaedist on 1/15/81 at which time she was noted to have an eschar with poor wound healing around the medial malleolus.  She was therefore admitted yesterday for I&D of the open lesion on her ankle, as well as hardware removal.  There is no operative report from the procedure.  Reportedly there was non-union of the fracture, so hardware was removed.  Tissue appeared fairly healthy.   \n\n \n\nShe denies having any recent fevers, chills, night sweats, or particular pain in the ankle.  She has been doing some weight bearing with use of a walker.  She has had some mild serous drainage from the ankle, but no purulent drainage.  \n\n\n\nROS: See HPI for positives.

If the swabs were obtained from the superficial wound, then this may represent merely a wound infection which requires 2 weeks of antibiotics.  However if the infection was felt on surgical inspection to extend to the region of the removed hardware, then this represents osteomyelitis by definition, and she will need 6 weeks of IV antibiotics with consideration of the removal of the remaining hardware.  \n\n\n\nAfter discussion with the ortho resident, it seems that the culture was obtained from the site of screw removal.  Thus, we have to assume hardware infection with concomitant osteomyelitis.  Thus 6 weeks of IV antibiotics is necessary.  We cannot rule out infection of the remaining hardware, however I understand the reluctance to remove the remainder of the hardware by the ortho service.  Thus would pursue 6 week course of therapy, then monitor closely for signs of failure. \n\n\n\n1.\tContinue vancomycin until susceptibilities are available; will determine whether the addition of rifampin in necessary given retained hardware based on susceptibility results\n\n2.

On 8/01/83 he was scheduled for a Colonoscopy, so his PCP suggested he have an UGI Endoscopy at the same time.  The Colonoscopy demonstrated Diverticulosis and the UGI Endoscopy demonstrated a partially obstructing esophageal/gastric cardia tumor which was biopsied.  Pathology revealed moderately to poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma.  On 8/10/83 an Abd and Pelvic CT were done showing:  marked thickening of the wall of the distal esophagus (35-40cm by endoscopy - partial obstruction and circumferential) extending into the gastric cardia, consistent with biopsy proven adenocarcinoma. Also felt to be bleeding silently so placed on Fe replacement. Also, enlarged gastroepiploic, celiac and aortocaval lymph nodes consistent with metastatic disease.  On 8/10/83 a Chest CT revealed thickening of the lower esophagus extending into the chest esophageal junction.  This is associated with lymphadenopathy in the (L) axilla, gastrohepatic ligament, celiac axis and retrocrural space.  The appearance is highly suspicious for esophageal cancer and nodal spread.

He is doing quite well. Given the fairly asymptomatic nature of his cancer we have opted to start with radiation first, as his primary mass is fungating in nature and there has been evidence of blood loss. After radiation is completed in 3-4 weeks, I will see him for consideration of chemotherapy but only after re-staging. If he remains asymptomatic and there has been little progression of disease, we may opt to observe him closely without treatment. If the scans show significant progression or he becomes symptomatic, then we will start systemic treatment soon afterwards. He is not a surgical candidate given his stage of disease and lack of symptoms.\n\n\n\nRTC in 5 weeks to assess symptoms and to arrange restaging scans.\n\n\n\n_____________________________________________\n\nXavier Otero, M.D.\n\n\n\ncc: \n\n\n\nDr. Geno Guidry\n\nDr. Gregory Mcguire\nRecord date: 2084-01-07\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\nFellow/NP\n\nXiang\n\n\n\n\n\nReason for Visit:  \n\ntaxotere weekly chemo\n\n\n\nDiagnosis/Treatment Summary: \n\nStage IVB (axillary and retroperitoneal LN and very large celiac axis LN mass) \n\ns/p XRT to esophagus\n\nRenal vein thrombus on Coumadin \n\n\n\nHistory:  Patient is a 72 year old man who began having dysphagia 6/83.

Past medical records.\n\n\n\nHistory of Present Illness  \n\n\n\nMr. Vollmer is a pleasant 73-year-old man with a past medical history significant for metastatic esophageal adenocarcinoma s/p XRT and chemotherapy, CAD s/p LAD stent placement, and borderline DM who presents to the Health Care Center complaining of 48-hour history of dizziness and subjective fevers.  He was in his usual state of health until three days prior to admission, when he awoke in the morning with a severe headache.  As he got out of bed, he felt extremely lightheaded.  He describes the dizziness as internal, and    not like the room was spinning.     He laid down, with some resolution of the symptoms.  Of note, he reports that the dizziness is less severe when he lies down and comes on with standing or sitting up.  Throughout the day, he developed a cough productive of green sputum, a subjective fever, continued headache, and nausea without vomiting.  He denied any chills, shortness of breath, chest pain, palpitations, or pain upon deep breathing.  That evening, two nights prior to admission, he developed night sweats but had no rigors.  He continued to feel similarly throughout the day prior to admission, and presented to the emergency room for further evaluation.  \n\n\n\nThe current presentation is in the context of increasingly poor PO intake secondary to chemotherapy and treatment for esophageal cancer.  He reports a four-to-five month history of poor appetite, eating chicken soup.  He denies any trouble swallowing solids or liquids.  Of note, the day prior to the onset of symptoms, he was NPO for a restaging CT scan.  He reports eating two scrambled eggs after the scan, and a chicken potpie for dinner the night prior to symptoms starting.\n\n\n\nIn the emergency room, vitals were temperature of 95.6, pulse 52, blood pressure 132/68, RR=20, 95% on room air.   He received Zofran 4 mg IV once, levofloxacin 500 mg PO once, and a NS 500 cc bolus.  CXR showed bibasilar infiltrate and bilateral pleural effusions.\n\n\n\nOncology History (per attending notes)\n\nPatient is a 72 year old man who began having dysphagia 6/83.  On 8/01/83 he was scheduled for a Colonoscopy, so his PCP suggested he have an UGI Endoscopy at the same time.

Physical exam reveals decreased bibasilar breath sounds, right greater than left.  The constellation of symptoms can be attributed to the pneumonia found on chest imaging.  The possible causes of the pneumonia include aspiration, infectious, and post-obstructive causes. The patient reports no problems with swallowing and has not vomited, making aspiration pneumonia lower on the differential.   The chest CT does not show any evidence of tumor obstruction around the bronchi.  Further, the pneumonia and pleural effusions are bilateral, meaning that the obstruction would have to be higher in the bronchial tree, making obstruction less likely.  In this case the most likely cause is infectious in nature; the agents most likely to cause pneumonia in this patient are the typical bacteria, such as pneumococcus, H. influenza, Staphalococcus, and other gram-negative bugs, atypical bacteria such as Legionella sp, Mycoplasma pneumoniae, and Chlamydia pneumoniae, and viral causes.  Based upon imaging findings, pneumonia most consistent with a bacterial infectious agent.\n\na.\tStart Levofloxacin 750 mg daily for antibacterial coverage.\n\nb.\tSputum gram stain and culture\n\nc.\tBlood cultures\n\nd.\tPneumococcus antigen screening\n\ne.\tU/A, urine Legionella\n\nf.\t  NS at 75 cc/hour.

Potential causes include orthostatic causes secondary to hypotension, dehydration, or poor sympthathetic tone; anxiety; cardiac causes (dysrhythmias, CAD), anemia, and electrolyte abnormalities (e.g. hypoglycemia).  This patient has a history of CAD, but EKG findings and cardiac enzymes do not suggest cardiac insult.  The patient has not had an increase in the BUN or creatinine from baseline, making dehydration less likely.  Labs did not show any electrolyte abnormalities; therefore hypoglycemia is low on the differential diagnosis.  The dizziness was positional in nature.  The patient reports long-standing poor PO intake, particularly because he was NPO for much of the day prior to the start of symptoms. In this patient, the cause of the dizziness is most likely orthostatic in nature, secondary to poor PO intake and decreased sympathetic tone.  \n\na.\t  NS at 75 cc/hour.  If PO intake is not increased, will switch fluids to D5  NS.\n\nb.\tCheck orthostatics daily.\n\n3.\tMetastatic esophageal adenocarcinoma:  Patient presents with known Stage IV-B metastatic esophageal adenocarcinoma with new CT findings suggestive of disease progression, particularly in the retroperitoneum.

Agree with above excellent HCC3 note.  Briefly, the patient is a 73 year-old male with h/o esophageal CA (Stage 4B), DM, HTN, CAD s/p LAD stent, renal v. thrombosis on Coumadin.  He presents today with 2 days of malaise, nausea, and    dizziness,     which he states does not consist of \"room spinning\" but that he does feel off-balance and is associated with nausea.  His PO intake has been decreased due to nausea.  Has has had a cough productive of green sputum, and CXR evidence of bibasilar consolidations and decreased breath sounds on exam R > L.  He was admitted to medicine for treatment of PNA in the setting of multiple comorbidities, and for lightheadedness on standing which is likely orthostatic.  \n\n\n\nWill treat with Levofloxacin 750 PO QD to cover CAP.  Send legionella urinary Agn, and sputum cx (blood cx sent in ED).  Check orthostatics.  IVF gentle hydration.  Need to clarify goal INR in setting of Coumadin use for renal vein thrombosis.  Microcytic anemia-will check anemia labs; already on iron supplementation.  EKG and 1 set of cardiac enzymes do not suggest an acute cardiac event.  Will treat nausea symptomatically.  Discussed with onc fellow (Dr. Kramer).\n\n\n\n\n\n____________________________\n\nGerald Echols MD\n\nPager 69793\nRecord date: 2084-05-26\n\nHCC CANCER CENTER ADMIT NOTE\n\n\n\nPATIENT:  Ulyses Vollmer\n\nMRN:        8740465\n\nDOA:        May 26, 2084\n\n\n\nCC:  73M w/ metastatic esophageal CA presenting to ED after presyncopal episode\n\n\n\nOncologic History\n\n6/83  Dysphagia\n\n7/83  EGD GE jnc mass; mod-poorly differentiated adenoca.

She continues to\ncomplain of rare retrosternal chest discomfort only occasionally\nsecondary to exertion.  These episodes occur on a roughly once a\nmonth basis lasting anywhere from seconds to several minutes. \nAddition of long acting nitrates to her medical regimen has had no\neffect on the frequency or severity of this syndrome and she does\nnot take Nitroglycerin for it.  A stress test performed last\nJanuary showed Mrs. Joshi exercising for 4 minutes and 30 seconds\nof a Bruce protocol stopping at a peak heart rate of 119, peak\nblood pressure of 150/70 secondary to dyspnea.  She had no ischemic\nEKG changes noted, however, a simultaneously obtained Sesta-MIBI\nscan revealed a minor fixed anterior wall defect as well as a small\nsurrounding area of transient ischemia.  In addition, there was a\nmoderately severe fixed inferior wall defect again with peri-\ninfarct mild ischemia.  Of note, her last serum cholesterol was 266\nwith an HDL of 52 and an LDL of 192. \n \nShe remains on a regimen of Isosorbide mononitrate 60 mg p.o. q.d.,\naspirin 1 tab p.o. q.d, Metoprolol 50 mg p.o. b.i.d., NPH 12 units\nS.C. q a.m. with 6 units CZI S.C. q a.m., and 15 units NPH S.C. q\np.m.. \n \nPhysical exam reveals a well nourished, overweight woman in no\nacute distress.  Blood pressure right arm sitting 160/90, heart\nrate 67 and regular, respirations 12 and unlabored, weight 264\npounds, which is six pounds above her weight of one year ago.  The\nneck is supple.  JVP flat.  Carotids are 2 + without bruits.  Chest\n \n                             Page 2\n \nKathy Joshi\nILC #158-42-11-2\n11-29-62\n \nremains clear.  Cardiac exam reveals normal S1, physiologically\nsplit S2 and a soft I/VI systolic ejection murmur.  The abdomen is\nbenign.  Extremities without appreciable edema.  \n \nElectrocardiogram shows sinus rhythm at a rate of 67, P-R interval\n.22, QRS .10, Q-T .36, axis 20 degrees.  There are isolated atrial\npremature depolarizations noted along with first degree AV block\nand a prior inferior posterior myocardial infarction with minor\nnonspecific ST and T wave changes.  Compared to his last\nelectrocardiogram there has been no significant change.\n \nImpression:  Mrs. Joshi continues to have evidence of mild, stable\nangina.  I have asked her to begin Simvastatin at 20 mg p.o. q h.s.\nfor her significant hyperlipidemia and I strongly encouraged her to\nmore aggressively try to lower her caloric intake and increase her\naerobic activity level.  In addition, I have asked her to obtain\nher blood pressure at least two or three more times on an\nambulatory basis and told her that if she remained reliably above\n140/85 then I would consider initiating pharmacologic\nantihypertensive therapy.  In addition, as long as she remains\nactive and asymptomatic, I will plan on repeating her exercise MIBI\nstress test in one to one and a half years time.  Beyond this I\nhave not altered her present regimen. \n \nOf course, I thank you for allowing me to assist in her care.\n \nRespectfully yours,\n \n \n \n \nBrandon W.

Currently, she complains of\n\nexertional fatigue, exertional dyspnea, and mild peripheral\n\nedema.  Since last seen, she has continued to find it quite\n\ndifficult to lose weight, and has thus far declined seeing\n\nmembers of our obesity clinic.  As you know, in the past, she\n\nalso has declined any consideration of attempted cardioversion or\n\nother invasive studies.  Presently, she remains on a regimen of\n\nenteric-coated aspirin 325 mg p.o. q.d., simvastatin 20 mg p.o.\n\nq.d., metoprolol 50 mg p.o. b.i.d., isosorbide nitrate 60 mg p.o.\n\nq.d., Avapro 150 mg p.o. q.d., Actos 45 mg p.o. q.d., potassium,\n\n10 mEq p.o. q.d. Pumex 2 mg p.o. q.d., Coumadin, magnesium oxide,\n\nHumulin insulin 20 units subcutaneous q. a.m. along with 50 units\n\nsubcutaneous q. p.m., and Humalog 26 units subcutaneous q. a.m.\n\n \n\nPhysical examination reveals a markedly overweight woman in no\n\nacute distress.  Blood pressure right arm sitting at 106/62,\n\nheart rate 65 and irregularly regular, respirations 16 and\n\nunlabored, weight 306 lbs, which is 6 lbs above her weight 10\n\nmonths ago.  The neck is soft.  JVP is flat.  Carotids without\n\nsignificant bruits.  Chest is clear.  Cardiac exam reveals a\n\nnormal S1, a physiologically split S2, with a1-2/6 systolic\n\nmurmur radiating from apex to the base.  No significant diastolic\n\nmurmur or rub.  The abdomen is obese, but otherwise benign.\n\nExtremities reveal 1-2+ bipedal edema, peripheral pulses are\n\nintact albeit mildly diminished.\n\n \n\nElectrocardiogram shows atrial fibrillation with a variable QRS\n\nresponse.  The P waves are more organized than one might usually\n\nsee, suggesting the possibility of fibrillation/flutter as well. \n\nQRS 0.11, QT 0.38, axis 90 degrees, there is evidence of a prior\n\ninferior myocardial infarction.  Compared with his last\n\nelectrocardiogram, there is no significant change.\n\n \n\nImpression:  Mrs. Joshy continues to suffer from morbid obesity,\n\nand I had a long discussion with her and her daughter regarding\n\nthe essential nature of her engaging in an aggressive weigh\n\nreduction program.  I once again have strongly encouraged her to\n\nmake an appointment with our obesity clinic to assist in\n\nextensive weight reduction.  I also discussed with her my\n\nconcerns regarding her symptoms of slowly progressive peripheral\n\nedema, particularly as it pertains both to her weight, and atrial\n\nor tachyarrhythmias.  As in the past, she told me that she would\n\nrefuse any consideration for attempted cardioversion or other\n\nstudies.  She did, however, agree to continue with her current\n\nmedical regimen.  I obtained routine blood studies today to\n\nverify the adequacy of her lipid control and diabetes management.\n\n I have introduced her to Hayden Nutter, her nurse practitioner, who\n\nwill assist in trying to achieve a little more diuresis overt he\n\nnext few weeks.  We have given her a prescription for Zaroxylyn\n\nto begin at 2.5 mg p.o. q.d., which will help result in some\n\ndegree of mild diuresis.  Nonetheless, she understands that\n\nsignificant weight loss can only occur through a weight reduction\n\nprogram.  I have of course explained to her the increased cardiac\n\nmorbidity associated with her current lifestyle.  Beyond this, I\n\nhave not altered her current medical regimen.\n\n \n\nOf course, I thank you for allowing me to assist in his care.\n\n \n\nSincerely yours,\n\n \n\nDictated By: Brandon Neilson\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n______________________________\n\nBrandon Neilson, M.D.\n\n \n\n \n\neScription document:8-5334486 AFFocus\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nDD: 10/01/70\n\nDT: 10/02/70\n\nDV: 10/01/70\n\n ******** Not reviewed by Attending Physician ********\nRecord date: 2071-07-20\n\nEDVISIT^15842112^Joshi, Kathy^07/20/71^KATZ, LAURA\n\nThis patient was seen, interviewed, and examined by myself\n\nprimarily.\n\nHISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 65-year-old female who\n\npresents with body swelling and shortness of breath.  The patient\n\nis unable to say when she specifically noted her lower extremity\n\nswelling.  She states that approximately 1 year prior to arrival\n\nshe had to throw out all of her shoes except for 2 pairs because\n\nall those shoes had become tight.  At the present time, the\n\npatient is only able to wear sandals and apparently her\n\nco-workers noted her to be significantly swollen and suggested\n\nthat she see a physician.  The patient states that there was no\n\nacute change in her swelling today.  She states that she has had\n\na cough for 1 month.  Again, there was no acute change.  Today,\n\nshe denies any chest pain at any time.  She does complain of\n\ndyspnea and specifically dyspnea on exertion, no PND, no\n\northopnea, and no change in her overall energy level.\n\nPAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  MI, atrial fibrillation, and diabetes\n\nmellitus.\n\nMEDICATIONS:  Coumadin, aspirin, insulin, Lasix, and Avapro. \n\nOtherwise as per the written note.\n\nALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.\n\nSOCIAL HISTORY:  Significant for no tobacco use, no alcohol use. \n\nThe patient works as an animal trainer.

Moist mucous membranes.  Extraocular motions are\n\nintact.  Sclerae are anicteric.  Neck is supple.  Full range of\n\nmotion.  JVD is difficult to assess due to the patient's body\n\nhabitus.  Lungs:  Positive crackles in the lower 1/4 of the lung\n\nfield bilaterally.  There is no dullness to percussion.  Cardiac:\n\n Irregularly regular, not tachycardic, no murmur is auscultated. \n\nRectal:  Heme-negative stool.  Abdomen:  Positive bowel sounds,\n\nsoft, distended, no fluid wave, no hepatomegaly is palpated but\n\npalpation is somewhat limited by the patient's body habitus. \n\nSkin is warm, dry, and intact.  There are various ecchymotic\n\nlesions on the extremities.  Extremities:  2+ edema of the\n\nbilateral lower extremities in the mid thighs.  Neurologic: \n\nAlert and oriented x3.

Taylor, M.D.\n\nIllini Community Hospital\n\n66 Cardinal Circle\n\nThree Rivers, NM  11424\n\n\n\nDear Dr. Taylor:\n\n\n\nMrs. Joshi returns to the office for routine followup.  Since last seen, she apparently was without evidence of increasing BUN and creatinine and for this reason was advised to transiently hold both her lisinopril and Zaroxolyn.  By doing so, her creatinine fell from 2.2 to 1.6 and BUN from 117 to 57.  She subsequently has resumed her lisinopril therapy, as apparently her blood pressure increased off her ACE inhibitor.  In addition, as part of her followup last March, she underwent an adenosine MIBI stress test during which time she achieved a peak heart rate of 65, peak blood pressure of 129/50, stopping because she reached the end of the adenosine infusion protocol.  Her gated SPECT imaging demonstrated a global left ventricular ejection fraction of 38% with a mildly dilated left ventricle and akinesis of the basal inferoseptal and entire inferior wall.  Her rest-stress perfusion imaging showed similarly a large fixed perfusion defect in the inferior and basal inferoseptal wall without any area of reversible ischemia.  Her last echocardiogram performed in July 2071 showed a residual of left ventricular ejection fraction mildly reduced at 45% with severe inferoseptal and inferior hypokinesis.  In addition, at that time showed evidence for trivial mitral and tricuspid regurgitation and her echo was essentially unchanged from her prior study in March 2071.\n\n\n\nCurrently, she is concerned primarily about her inability to lose weight, and in fact states that during a recent vacation she actually discontinued her diet.  Presently, she continues on a regimen of Toprol-XL 37.5 mg p.o. daily, simvastatin 80 mg p.o. daily, lisinopril 5 mg p.o. daily, potassium chloride 20 mEq p.o. b.i.d., furosemide 160 mg p.o. b.i.d., Coumadin, enteric-coated aspirin 81 mg p.o. daily, Niferex 150 mg p.o. daily, Humulin N 20 units subcutaneous q.a.m. and Humulin N 20 units subcutaneous q.p.m.\n\n\n\nPhysical exam reveals a pleasant, mildly overweight woman in no acute distress.  Blood pressure right arm sitting 120/52, heart rate 45 and irregularly regular, respirations 14 and unlabored, and weight 253 pounds, which is 12 pounds above her weight of six months ago.  The neck is supple.  JVP is flat.  Carotids are without significant bruits.  Chest remains clear.  Cardiac exam shows normal S1, physiologically split S2 with a soft systolic ejection murmur radiating from the apex to the base.  No significant diastolic murmur or rub.  The abdomen is overweight, but otherwise benign without evidence of abdominal aneurysm or bruit.  Extremities reveal trace bipedal edema.  Peripheral pulses are detectable, albeit mildly diminished.\n\n\n\nElectrocardiogram shows atrial fibrillation flutter with at times of significant AV block with pauses as high as approximately 2 seconds.  There is evidence of a prior inferior myocardial infarction and minor nonspecific ST and T-wave changes.  Compared with her last electrocardiogram, her heart rate at times is slower.\n\n\n\nImpression:  Ms. Joshi remains stable from a cardiovascular perspective, however, I am obviously concerned about her potential for lightheadedness in light of her bradycardia.  I have asked her to decrease her Toprol-XL to 25 mg p.o. daily and to repeat an EKG four to five days after doing so.  I of course have reminded her as to the importance of getting in contact with you or myself straight away should she develop any symptoms suggestive of lightheadedness or dizziness.  She understands that she may require a permanent pacemaker in the future.  Most recent blood studies show a significantly elevated glucose of 183 (she states she is trying to tailor her insulin regimen with you) and in January, normal liver function studies except for an alkaline phosphatase of 304 and lipid profile last September notable for a cholesterol of 134, triglyceride of 74, HDL 58, and LDL 61.  She understands the importance of continuing to adhere to a low-saturated fat, low-cholesterol diet while remaining on her antilipemic therapy.  She will discuss with you and her nephrologist the optimal management of her mild renal insufficiency.  In light of both her diabetes and coronary disease, it certainly would be optimal if possible to continue her on her ACE inhibitor.  At the present time, she does not meet criteria for prophylactic placement of an AICD and her New York Heart Association class I to II status precludes the need for consideration of biventricular pacing.  Other than reducing her beta-blocker regimen as described above, I have not further altered her current medical program.\n\n\n\nI thank you very much for allowing me to assist in her care.\n\n\n\nSincerely yours,\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBrandon W Neilson, M.D.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\neScription document:0-2421626 RU\n\n\n\nCC: James Nolen M.D.\n\n48 Auburn Street\n\nRehoboth, NM 42761\n\n\n\n\n\nDD: 07/06/72\n\nDT: 07/07/72\n\nDV: 07/06/72"}

I confirm that I have\n\ninterviewed and examined the patient, reviewed the resident's\n\ndocumentation on the patient's chart, and discussed the\n\nevaluation, plan of care, and disposition with the patient.\n\nHISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 73-year-old male with a\n\nhistory of cough and pleuritic type chest pain.  The patient\n\ndenies any nausea or vomiting.  He does have history of MI as\n\nwell as multiple risk factors for coronary artery disease.  He\n\nalso reports lower extremities swelling worse than usual, and has\n\nleft greater than right edema at baseline due to a reconstructive\n\nsurgery following motor vehicle collision.  Of note, the\n\npatient's medications include Coumadin, which he is on for atrial\n\nfibrillation.\n\nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  The patient is awake, alert, and in no\n\ndistress.  His vital signs show heart rate of 70, respiratory\n\nrate of 24, blood pressure 112/72, and oxygen saturation 96% on\n\nroom air and 98% on 2 liters.  His lungs are clear and heart is\n\nirregularly irregular.  This is somewhat limited due to body\n\nhabitus.  The abdomen is soft and there is a chronic left upper\n\nquadrant tenderness.  The back shows left CVA tenderness.\n\nLABORATORY DATA:  The laboratory analysis shows a hematocrit of\n\n42.1 and a white blood cell count of 7.6.  Cardiac biomarkers are\n\nnegative, and the troponin is less than 0.1.  A d-dimer is less\n\nthan 200.  The INR is 1.7.  UA is pending.  ECG shows an atrial\n\nfibrillation with some nonspecific T-wave changes in leads V3\n\nthrough V6.\n\nIMAGING STUDIES:  A chest radiograph was a markedly limited due\n\nto patient's habitus.\n\nDECISION MAKING AND EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT COURSE:  There was no\n\nclear etiology to the patient's shortness of breath.  Given his\n\nanticoagulation and a negative d-dimer, we feel that this is\n\nunlikely to be PE.  It is clearly possible to be cardiac, given\n\nthe history of coronary artery disease and a slightly abnormal\n\nelectrocardiogram.  This may be pneumonia, and the chest x-ray is\n\nnot terribly helpful.  We are obtaining a CT scan of the chest\n\nwithout IV contrast to better delineate the pulmonary\n\narchitecture, and are admitting the patient to the Medicine\n\nService for monitoring and cycling of enzymes and ECGs.\n\nDIAGNOSES:\n\n1.  Shortness of breath.\n\n2.  T-wave inversions on electrocardiogram.\n\n______________________________\n\nELROD, RYLEY M.D.\n\nD: 07/25/85\n\nT: 07/25/85\n\nDictated By: ELROD, RYLEY\n\neScription document:5-9812947 BFFocus\n\n ******** Not reviewed by Attending Physician ********\nRecord date: 2088-11-29\n\nLCFMC D Housestaff Admission Note\nIntern: Woods\nAtt:Ball\n\n\n\n\nCC: \n\nDyspnea/Chest pain\n\n\nHPI: 76 year old Spanish speaking male with numerous medical problems (IDDM, Afib, HTN, PVD, Cr baseline 1.7, no prior HF,, normal echo 2085, normal MIBI 2085) who was just dishcharged 28 days ago for LE edema admission, who complains of 3 weeks of sore throat.

Dr. Remigio Allison was present for or performed all salient aspects of the history and physical exam and together we discussed with the patient the work-up and treatment plan. We spent greater than 50% of the visit in education and counseling of the patient and family.\n\nHPI: As you know, Ms. Klein is a 74 yo RH woman with history of HTN, hyperlipidemia, CAD s/p LAD stent (2144), migraine, who was in her USOH until the afternoon of 2/6/50 when she experienced sudden onset of garbled speech and difficulty \"expressing myself\" while cooking lunch for she and her husband.  This episode was accompanied shortly thereafter by a dull, L fronto-temporal headache that persisted for several hours.  She states she did not have word-finding difficulties but simply had trouble articulating herself.   In particular she related several examples of semantic paraphasic errors.  The episode came on suddenly and lasted 1-2 hours before she resolved back to baseline.  In addition to headache, associated symptoms included generalized weakness, feeling cold and mildly nauseated.  She denied visual changes, chest pain, sob, palpitations, lightheadedness, vertigo, difficulty with swallowing, coordination or gait.  She describes having a glass of orange juice with the thought that her sugar might be low, without apparent effect.  She recalled one similar episode ~ 2 years ago at which time she had her husband drive her home and she went to bed.  The speech difficulty had resolved by morning, and she apparently never told her physician or had any further work-up.  She has no known history of seizures but migraines occur 1-2x/year, last 30 minutes to several hours and are typically preceeded by scintillating scotoma (   jagged horizontal lines   ), associated with nausea/photophobia, and relieved by sleep.\n\nGiven her multiple vascular risk factors, she was admitted for TIA work-up which was unremarkable with the exception of mildly elevated HbA1c (7.0) including lipids, ESR, homocysteine, lipoprotein (a), TTE and holter.  CT/CT-a and MRI did not show any evidence of acute stroke or significant cervical or intracranial arterial stenosis.  She was discharged on her home medications, which included ASA 325mg po qd, with a diagnosis of complex migraine.  Since return home, she has had additional typical episodes of migraine, (about every 2 weeks) without the aphasia which brought her into the hospital.  She has tried Excedrin migraine a few times recently, with good results.\n\nROS:  Sometimes    sees stars    when she stands up too quickly after bending over.  Similarly feels that her balance is transiently affected when getting out of bed in the morning (   I rock   ).  She is awaiting thyroid biopsy of the nodules incidentally discovered on CT-CT-a.  Negative in detail including change in weight, energy, appetite, CP, palpitations, SOB, DOE, N/V/D/cough, fever, chills, rash, BRBPR, melena, abdominal pain, change in bowel or bladder habits.  In addition, patient denies change in vision, hearing, tinnitus, vertigo, numbness, weakness, slurred speech, difficulty with language, swallowing, eating, or gait.\n\nPast Medical History: \nCAD s/p LAD stent 2144\nHTN\nHyperlipidemia\nMigraine HA: +scintillating scotoma, +photophobia, +nauea, relieved with sleep.\nFamilial tremor\nNephrolithiasis\nS/p appendectomy\nS/p mastoid surgery as ahild\nS/p borderline DM\n\nMedications: \nASA 325\nLipitor 10\nIsordil\nVerapamil 240\nAtenolol 25\nProtonix 40\nHCTZ 12.5\nMVI\nB6/B12\n\nAllergies: Sulfa drugs cause hives, laryngeal edema\n     \nSocial History: Lives at home with husband, mother of 4 children, works as performer.\nDenies tobacco, ETOH, or illicit drug use.\n\nFamily History:  Father with history of asbestosis, construction.

Since discharge, she has continued to have her baseline migraines at a frequency of ~ 2x/month.  At this point, we would not recommend beginning prophylactic therapy, but would consider doing so if attacks become more frequent.  Given her clinical response to Excedrin migraine, we have suggested continuing this drug for abortive therapy, but have spoken at length about the phenomenon of rebound headache and cautioned her about using it more than once every 10-14 days.  We have discussed the phenomenon of complex migraine and reinforced the inherent difficulties of distinguishing these attacks from TIA/stroke; thus we have urged to continue to take unusual non-stereotyped deficits seriously.  She will follow-up with us in 4-6 months or sooner if the need arises. \n\nThank you for allowing us to participate in the care of this patient.  We look forward to seeing her in follow-up.\n\nSincerely,\n\n___________________________________\nOlen X.

You know Michelle well, she does have coronary artery disease, has had an LAD stent placed in 2148, and had a normal stress sestamibi study in November 2151.  She has moderate mitral insufficiency.  Her left atrial dimension is 52 and RV pressure 42.  She is diabetic and has hypertension.  She was hospitalized with a diarrheal bleeding issue attributed to salmonella infection attributed to tomatoes it also affecting her husband and this was accomplished at the Copley Hospital.\n\nHer medications were modified somewhat.  She presently takes atenolol 50 mg a day, verapamil 120 mg per day, Lipitor 10 mg a day, Diovan 80 mg per day, they held her aspirin and her Imdur, she takes Prilosec 40 mg BID, and metformin 500 mg BID.  Her blood pressure remains high today at 147/70, it had been similar range when I saw her in June this year.  Pending her diarrhea at home, we may need to go back up on some of her medications, but at this point we will change.  She is symptom free vis-a-vie her heart.\n\nHer exam shows no cyanosis, clubbing, or edema.  Normal thyroid, normal neck veins, and arteries.  Clear lungs.  Normal abdomen, nontender, and no mass felt.  Her heart palpates normally.  There were no thrills and no scars.  Her first sound is soft and second is normal.  There is a 1/6 apical mitral insufficiency murmur with positive response to isometrics.  There were no diastolic murmurs.  Blood pressure is 145/70.\n\nThe electrocardiogram was normal with trace nonspecific ST flattening.\n\nI will plan to reassess Michelle in four months and she will have a recheck several times a month of her blood pressure at home and she will send diaries to me.  If her blood pressure is continued at home to be in her present level, we will advance her medications to accommodate this.  If there are any questions feel free to call me.\n\nSincerely yours,\n\n\t\nTony Wilkinson, MD\n\n\t\nSigned electronically by  Tony Wilkinson, MD\nDocument Status: Final\nRecord date: 2154-07-21\n\n\n\tCARDIOLOGY\n\t\n\n\tVALLEY COUNTY HOSPITAL\n\t\n\nEva  Newby M.D. \nValley County Hospital\n____\n,  \n\nDear Dr. Newby:\n\n  I was happy to see Michelle Klein (2474410: DOB August 6, 2075) who comes along with her husband, Nathaniel, for follow up cardiac evaluation. Michelle has been stable from a cardiac point of view. She has coronary artery disease and underwent LAD stent placement in 2148. She had negative stress sestamibi study in November 2151. She has been free of angina or cardiac-related symptoms. She notes occasional orthostatic dizziness. Her prior stamina symptoms have improved greatly. She has well-controlled hypertension on stable medical regimen. Her recent diagnosis of myelofibrosis has been followed through closely by her hematology group here at Valley County and we have discussed this at length. Michelle feels far better than at her last several visits and I am very happy to see this.\n\nOn clinical exam, blood pressure right arm is 130/80 mmHg, pulses are equal, normal and all well felt. First heart sound is normal to soft. Second is normal. There is a 1+/6 systolic apical murmur. No diastolic murmurs are present. No cyanosis, clubbing or edema. Thyroid is postoperative and stable. Neck veins are flat. Carotid upstrokes are normal. Lungs are clear. Abdominal exam is normal. I do not feel enlargement of the abdominal aorta.\n\nThe electrocardiogram is unchanged. It continues to show minimal nonspecific ST flattening and left atrial prominence.\n\nMedications: Michelle no longer takes the verapamil, atenolol 50 mg per day, Lipitor 10 mg per day, Diovan 40 mg daily, Protonix 40 mg b.i.d., Synthroid 1.12 mg per day, vitamin B12 500 mg, B6 100 mg, magnesium 400 mg per day, and D3 2000 IU per day.\n\nIf there are any questions at anytime, please call me. I am happy to see Michelle 's spirits are good and that she is feeling better and actually, her clinical exam seems excellent as well. She does not manifest tachycardia. I note that her hematocrit is 31%.  Visit duration 40 min.-half in discussion re he cardiac and hematologic issues.\n\nBest regards.\n\nSincerely yours,\n\n\t\nTony Wilkinson, MD\n\n\t\nSigned electronically by  Tony Wilkinson, MD\nDocument Status: Final"}

She must stop at the top to rest. She denies chest pain, lightheadedness, orthopnea, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, syncope, or lower extremity edema. A recent echocardiogram in February revealed an ejection fraction of 71%, mild mitral regurgitation, aortic stenosis with a peak gradient of 45mmHg, mean of 29mmHg, and a valve area of 0.8 sq cm. There are no wall motion abnormalities of the left ventricle. A stress test in February revealed a reduced exercise capacity with a small area of mild apical ischemia and ejection fraction of 77%. A cardiac catheterization on 3/8 revealed 50% left main stenosis, 40-50% left anterior descending, 30% circumflex and 50% right coronary artery stenosis. Aortic valve area was noted at 0.98 sq cm. Carotid non-invasive studies revealed bilateral 20-49% stenosis.\n\nShe was referred to Dr. Gonzalez for an aortic valve replacement and coronary artery bypass graft surgery.

We did her surgery, and she had a very uneventful postoperative course.  \n\nShe was discharged home on postoperative day seven and has continued to make progress.  She is walking each day.  Her medications include 5 mg of Norvasc, 25 mg of Toprol-XL, 20 mg of simvastatin and an aspirin and her Plaquenil.  She has no complaints of pain.  She is eating well.  She is sleeping well.  Her incisions have healed nicely.  Her sternum is stable, and she has no murmurs.  Overall, I am extremely pleased with her progress.  I told her to suggest to you that she was interested in cardiac rehab which she should be able to start in the next week or two.\n\nThank you so much for the opportunity of caring for her.\n\n\nNorma Gonzalez, M.D.\n\n\ncc:Holly Xavia Avalos, M.D.\nJackson X.

She is followed in rheumatology for mixed connective tissue disease. She was initially seen in March 2094, when she was admitted with fever, nausea and chest pain. Her chest CT showed an interstitial pattern and a patulous esophagus; the interstitial lung disease was thought to be in part due to the mixed connective tissue disease and in part due to aspiration. She was also noted at that time to have an ANA 1:2560 speckled with positive RNP, negative Scl-70. Clinically, she had Sjogren's with sclerodermatous changes to her hands and telangiectasias across her face. The Raynaud's was exacerbated by the extensive peripheral vascular disease and she had to undergo stenting of the right common femoral artery 11/2095. Slowly these lesions healed. \n\n\nInterim Issues:\nThe diabetes and hypertension slowly became well controlled. But on exercise tolerance test, she presented with significant coronary artery disease and was noted to have significant aortic stenosis. In April 2097 she underwent stenting and she had a prosthetic aortic valve placed. Recovering from surgery has been slow. But it has been steady and uncomplicated. She can now go up 2 flights of stairs, then rest to go the third flight to her home. She has had no recurrent chest pain. She keeps her hands and feet warm and has had no tissue damage. She feels a little tightness in the chest wall in taking a deep breath (points anteriorly), but no dyspnea per se. She healed well postoperatively. She has recently been seen by cardiology and Dr. Nichols and seems to be in good shape. Her medications were reviewed and updated in the LMR. \n\n\n\nIn terms of the MCTD, she continues to have some Raynaud's. She tries to keep her hands warm and she has had little breakdown of the tissue but rather thickening of her hands. What troubles her most is the intermittent synovitis. She felt much better on 5 mg of prednisone daily. She remains on Plaquenil 200 mg daily. She has had no worsening swallowing.  She has had no fever, pneumonia or progressive dyspnea on exertion. She sleeps on two pillows. She denies waking up with any bitterness in her mouth. She continues on omeprazole. Complete ROS in detail is otherwise negative. \n\n\nMEDS:\nAmlodipine 5 MG QD \nAspirin  325 MG QD  \nHydrochlorothiazide 12.5 MG QD \nLisinopril 2.5 MG QD \nMetformin 500 MG BID \nMetoprolol Succinate Extended Release 25 MG QD \nPlaquenil  200 MG  QD \nSimvastatin 20 MG  QHS\n\n\n\nFH/SH: She comes in with her husband, who feels she is doing very well and is delighted to see her better. Ms. Cantu went back to work 3 months after surgery. \n\n\nPMH: \n\nDM. \n\nHypertension. \n\nPeripheral artery disease. \n\nASCVD with mild bilateral carotid stenosis (2096). \n\nMelanoma (surgical resection right thigh in 2077). \n\nT&amp;A.\n\n\n\n\nALLERGIES: NKDA. \n\n\n\nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION: \nBP 132/71, P 86, RR 16, Temp 97.7 F, Wt 132 lb\nO2 SAT 98\nPAIN LEVEL (0-10) 0\nShe has telangiectasias over her face. She looks well to me. Her color is good and she smiles easily. She has profound dryness of her mouth, but no particular injection of her eyes. Her neck is reasonably supple, the skin tightened here. Perhaps tightened a bit over her face as well. But the chest wall itself has no scleroderma. The midline scar has healed beautifully. The respiratory excursions appear full. There is no splinting. There are some bilateral crackles. Her hands are thickened from the scleroderma aspect of her disease. There are no nail bed infarcts. There is some peripheral pitting of digits. Her feet are well healed, warm and well perfused. Her joints are benign today with no active synovitis. Heart: S1, S2 with a soft crisp, S2 noted. No insufficiency murmurs. \n\n\n\nIMPRESSION: \n\nMCTD/Raynaud's.\nSjogren's\n\nASCVD with aortic valve replacement 4/2097. \n\nPVD. \n\n\nPLAN\n\nEducation regarding the importance of protection re: trauma to finger tips and prevention of Raynaud's. \nContinue Prilosec, refill Plaquenil\nPrescribe prednisone 5 mg p.r.n. arthritis. I think it would be safe for her to take every morning as long as her diabetes remains well controlled and she feels much better on it; that is, the benefits outweigh the risks. \n\n\nHer labs have been sent and a chest x-ray obtained. \n\n\nI will see her in 6 months, sooner if there are any issues in the interim. \nInterview time 45 minutes due to medical history review, questions and verification of medications with the patient. \n\n\nShe and her husband agree with this plan. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n___________________________\n\nLucille Jackson, M.D.\n\n\nDictated Date:  01/26/2098                        Dictated by:  Lucille Jackson, M.D. \n\n\n\n\nDD: 01/26/2098 12:19:21\n\nTD: 01/26/2098 15:22:25\n\nTR: 8279572\n\nBackJob ID:  0324547\n\nVoiceJob ID:  01397820\n\n\n\n\nResults01/26/2098 NA 141,  K 4.9 (H),  CL 99 (L),  CO2 28.4,  BUN 19,  CRE 0.74,  EGFR &gt;60,  GLU 124 (H)01/26/2098 ANION 1401/26/2098 CA 10.0,  PHOS 4.0,  MG 1.8,  TBILI 0.3,  TP 8.9 (H),  ALB 4.8,  GLOB 4.1,  25 OH-VITD PEND01/26/2098 ALT/SGPT 10,  AST/SGOT 20,  ALKP 82,  TBILI 0.301/26/2098 CK 5201/26/2098 FE 63,  TIBC 33801/26/2098 WBC 6.4,  RBC 4.08,  HGB 11.9 (L),  HCT 35.0 (L),  MCV 86,  MCH 29.3,  MCHC 34.1,  PLT 30601/26/2098 RDW 14.7 (H)01/26/2098 METHOD Auto,  %NEUT 74 (H),  %LYMPH 18 (L),  %MONO 6,  %EOS 2,  %BASO 001/26/2098 ANEUT 4.73,  ALYMP 1.15,  AMONS 0.40,  AEOSN 0.11,  ABASOP 0.0101/26/2098 ANISO None,  HYPO None,  MACRO None,  MICRO None01/26/2098 ESR 83 (H)01/26/2098 CRP-MG/L 3.0\n\nCXR\nResultsRadiologyExam Number:  55708166                        Report Status:  FinalType:  Chest 2 ViewsDate/Time:  01/26/2098 12:35Exam Code:  MTNS5Ordering Provider:  Jackson, Lucille MDHISTORY:       Chest pain - RoeID04109093     REPORT     Frontal and lateral views of the chest.

So, I had him back today to discuss diabetic management and also review his general health in terms of his diabetes and his other medications.\n\n\n\nWe went over his medications to start with and he is taking them exactly as it was shown in the computer.  These include atenolol 25, Glucotrol 10 twice a day, Actos 45, Lipitor 40 a day, Lasix 40 a day, and Procardia XL 60 mg q.d., and Coumadin.  He is followed by Dr. Itzel Jaimes for his cardiac problems and by a diabetologist at the Claiborne for managing his diabetes.\n\n\n\nHe had no other complaints.  His bowel movements are regular.  He still has nocturia x3 and was recently seen by a urologist who felt there was no need for any intervention.\n\n\n\nHe otherwise was in good spirits and has no immediate complaints.\n\n\n\nHis social situation, his allergies and and his family history and past medical history, are overall as previously recorded.  There are no other pertinent findings in the review of systems.\n\n\n\nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  His blood pressure was 140/60.  He looks well.  I did not measure his weight.  His heart rate was around 64-68.  His pupils are equal and reactive to light and extraocular movements were full.  Mucous membranes of the mouth and tongue were normal.  Lungs were clear to percussion and auscultation.  Cardiac exam showed regular sinus rhythm, a normal S2 and no significant murmurs.  Liver and spleen were not palpable.  He had only 1+ peripheral edema which is less than usual.\n\n\n\nASSESSMENT AND PLAN:  He seems stable, I think the biggest problem is regulation of diabetes and I have asked him to get a hemoglobin A1c and to measure his blood sugar when he gets up in the morning and in the afternoon before he has supper.

She felt that his urine output had decreased at home, and that his urine had been foul-smelling for two days.  He was treated empirically with levofloxacin and transfused 2U PRBC for HCT 26.  His Cr was elevated at 3.1, and his K was 6.4.  He was admitted to a telemetry bed on the medical service for management of the above issues.  The patient has been hemodynamically stable, and his only subjective complaint has been general malaise.\n\n\nWe are consulted with the question of whether his stents may be changed during his current admission.\n\n\nPMH:        Duchenne&#8217;s muscular dystrophy, COPD (2.5L home O2), IDDM, recurrent UTIs w/ previous Candida tropicalis fungemia (followed by Dr. Phoebe Abreu), B ureteral obstruction s/p ureteral stent placement, CAD s/p CABG, PVD, SZ disorder, hyperkalemia secondary to hyperaldosteronemia (type III RTA), CRI (baseline 1.5)\n\n\nPSH:        CABG; cystoscopy, B RPG, B ureteral stent placement 11/93; cystoscopy, B ureteral stent change 2/94\n\n\nMED:        vancomycin, ceftriaxone, fluconazole, lactulose, senna, kayexalate, tramadol, sarna, nystatin, paxil, lipitor, lantus, humalog ISS, keppra, labetalol, meclizine, prilosec\n\n\nALL:        PCN\n\n\nPE:           AVSS\n                NAD; alert, responsive, and interactive\n                S/NT/ND\n                Phallus uncircumcised w/ easily retractible foreskin; meatus WNL\n                Testes descended bilaterally and nontender\n                Foley to gravity draining clear urine with sediment\n\n\nLABS:      Chem7 (12/24) &#8211; 137/6.0/108/16/83/2.7/79\n                CBC (12/24) &#8211; 6.4/33.4/233\n                Coags (12/24) &#8211; 13/58/1.1\n                U/A (12/23) &#8211; 305W, &gt;100R, tr LE, neg NIT, 1+ bac, + pro, lg heme\n                UCx (12/23) &#8211; NGSF\n\n\nRADS:     CT A/P W/O CONTRAST &#8211; pending\n\n\nA/P:  77M w/ multiple medical problems including muscular dystrophy and B ureteral obstruction, now admitted w/ ARF, hyperkalemia, anemia, and a presumed UTI.  His U/A and UCx are not overwhelmingly c/w a UTI, but his clinical presentation was reportedly similar to prior UTI presentations.  He is being managed by ID.  His ureteral stents were last changed 2/94, but he has never obtained a diagnosis for his B ureteral obstruction.  His abdominal CT is pending.  He remains clinically stable, with significantly improved cognition and awareness since admission.  As such, we recommend:\n--F/U UCx and ID recs, as you are doing.\n--F/U CT A/P to assess for recurrent hydronephrosis.  Depending on the results of this study, we will consider ureteral stent change vs. staged removal.  Regardless of his eventual stent plan, he should be medically cleared for an operative procedure, which would entail stabilization of his hyperkalemia prior to undergoing anaesthesia.\n\n\nD/w Dr. Ferreira, who agrees with above plan.

CV: BP well controlled today, but in the absence of his wife it is entirely unclear what medications he is taking.  We had added imdur at our last visit for BP and antianginal control, and I had suggested re-starting Diltiazem.  It is unclear if either of these changes are occurring.  I will attempt to call his wife to discuss medication regimen, and we will hold on any changes for now.\n       - F/u with Dr. Vest\n       - Follow INR\n       - Discuss current cardiac regimen with his wife\n\n\n#. Oliguric ESRD: He had been doing well via his AVF but with recent sutures after bleeding they have been using his tunneled HD line, which now remains since 3/30/97 unless changed over wire at HD.  He is dialyzed at Ochsner Health Center Denham Springs in Pahrump. His Nephrologist is Dr. Frank Marquez, and he is pageable at951-440-0959 (Northwest Hospital).  \n\n\n#. GI: His LFTs are now normal, and his HCV viral load/genotype have not been able to be determined.  It is possible that he has cleared HCV infection in the past.  We will continue to follow HCV viral  load and consider referral to GI to discuss treatment if LFTs rise of unclear etiology.  His synthetic function is mostly preserved.  #. DM2: Again, in the absence of his wife it is difficult to determine his current regimen.  Last A1C was 6.0, and with recent evidence we will continue his current regimen.\n  \n#. OSA: Sleep study completed, qualifies for CPAP, and using with good effect.  \n\n\n#. Other: Repeat utility letter\n\n\nD/W.

He came back from Pennsylvania after being there about a month.  He has had an eventful past six months.  In October, he apparently had a TIA or small stroke.  He was evaluated with an MRA of his neck and was told that there was not enough blockage to warrant surgery.  His symptomatology fortunately clear.  His symptoms were related to loss of feeling in his right upper extremity.  About this time, he also developed a traumatic lesion of the left second toe.  He apparently develops some cellulitis and was treated with ampicillin.  Not long after this, he went into renal failure.  He was told that they could not tell if that was due to the antibiotics or the gadolinium.  According to the patient and his wife, his creatinine went as high as 9.  Fortunately, it is currently back down to 2.4.\n\n\nHis toe lesion has been very slow to improve.  He describes pain in the toe and often has to sleep in a chair with his foot dependent.  He has seen various physicians and podiatrists in Pennsylvania, without much improvement.  They finally told him, he would do well to come back here for further care and evaluation.\n\n\nOn examination today, I can feel femoral and popiteal pulses.  I do not feel any definite pedal pulses on either side but noninvasive study show good pulsatile flow at the calf and transmetatarsal level.  Resting ABI is good, although his diabetic calcinosis probably makes this unreliable.  He has some slight pulsatile flow at the right toe level and flat tracings at left toes.  He has 1 cm escharover the dorsum of his second toe.  There is some erythema of the toe and proximal dorsal forefoot.  This certainly has the appearance of some cellulites.  There is minimal to no swelling of the toe.\n\n\nWe will place him on Keflex 250 mg q.i.d. for 7 to 10 days to see if this helps with any possible associated cellulitis.  I will refer him to Dr. Caldwell for recommendations regarding wound quick care and an opinion whether or not hyperbaric oxygen therapy might be worth considering.  I do not think there is anything further we can do to improve his distal blood flow.  Further imaging will also be very difficult in view of the possible problems with gadolinium as well as his creatinine, which limit contrast administration.  His noninvasive studies suggest that his problems are all diabetic small vessel disease and it is unlikely that we could be of benefit with this.  I will await Dr. Caldwell&#8217;s opinions.\nRecord date: 2105-08-11\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\nVascular Surgery/Emergency Department Surgical Admission Note\n\n\n\n                                                                                                             \n\nPatient: Jorgenson, Andrew C.  \n\nMRN: 9125902\n\nDate: 8/11/05\n\n\n\nCC: cool right foot and progressive claudication\n\n\n\nHPI: The patient is a 74 yo male with a history of CAD, PVD s/p right femoral to above knee popliteal bypass with PTFE (5/00) who presents to the ED with right foot pain. \n\n\n\nThe patient has developed progressive R calf pain over the past 2 months, which has become worse over the past 10 days. \nHe is unable to walk more than a half block without cramping pain in his calf.  Because of his previous bypass surgery and current complaints, he underwent vascular studies today demonstrating critical atherosclerotic disease in the RLE, with markedly reduced flow through the R graft. \nThe toe-brachial index was not able to be calculated on the R, and was 0.31 on the L.   He is currently taking ASA 325 mg po daily, but no plavix or Coumadin.  \n\n\n\nOver the past week, the patient reports that his pain has become more severe.  He has otherwise felt well and in his normal state of health, and denies fevers/chills, chest pain, shortness of breath, and all other symptoms.   \n\n\n\nPast Medical History:\n\nCAD w/ EF 50%\n\nPVD s/p bypass surgery as above\n\nRA \n\nDM\n\nHTN \n\nCRI \n\nh/o TIA (RUE weakness) \n\nh/o esophageal \n\nstricture s/p esophageal dilation 4/2104\n\n\n\nPast Surgical History:\n\ns/p L CEA 5/05\n\nAngioplasty of L SFA, Pop, Tibioperoneal trunk 6/05/04\n\nRight femoral to above knee popliteal bypass graft with 6 mm PTFE. 5/00\n\nCABG x 3 (2099)\n\nEsopahgeal hiatal hernia with Schotzsky ring\n\nBilateral hernia repair 2089\n\nAppendectomy 2060\n\nLithotripsy 1/99, 4/99\n\n\n\nMedications:\n\n1.

The case was complicated by large blood loss anemia and hypotension.  In the PACU the patient continued to be hypotensive and have low uop. We placed a central line (starting CVP was 0) and continued resuscitation. The patient developed ST changes and also had acute on chronic renal failure (RIFLE F). WE transfused and transferred him to the ICU.  We discussed this at length with the surgical service as well as cardiology.\n \nI examined the patient reviewed the chart and discussed the case. I agree with history and exam as outlined in residents note\n \nIssues:\nCardiac ischemia:  Ischemia was mostly due to hypotension and low HGB as well as tachycardia .  Will give aspirin and lower HR to 70's with Beta blockers. Contue statin.  Willt ransfuse to HGB around 10 and continue to check troponins\n \nDecreased myocardial function: he has low central venous saturation and increased lactate . Will give fluids and transfuse the patient.  Will get echo in am. If his central venous sat  and lactate does not signficantly improve with these measures would stay away from inotropes for now given his rate related ischemia\n \nAcute blood-loss naemia: will transfuse to \n \nMetabolic acidosis: the patetin has signifcant metabolic acidosis. We will for now give volume. \n \nAcute renal failure: He has significantly decreaed uop. We are sending  urine lytes and casts. Will increase filling pressures.

Blood pressure 130/80. \n\nMEDICATIONS:   He finished Flagyl last night, and he took his last dose of levoflox\ntoday.  Glyburide is on hold.  He is taking hydrochlorothiazide 25 mg q.d., Lovastatin\n20 mg q.d., fosinopril 40 mg q.d., verapamil SR 240 mg q.d., ASA 1 q.d., metoprolol\n75 mg three times a day and Glucophage 1000 mg b.i.d.  \n\n(1)  Diverticulitis and history of colon cancer.  \n\n     S:   His pain is gone although he continues to have a bad taste in his mouth\n          since he has been on antibiotics. \n\n     O:   His abdomen is soft with normal bowel sounds.  There is no tenderness\n          today.  \n\n     P:   He will need colonoscopy at the Atlantic North in a month or so. \n\n(2)  Diarrhea.  \n\n     S:   He has continued to have several soft, dark bowel movements a day\n          while he has been taking the antibiotic.  He has not seen any bright red\n          blood per rectum.  He has been using Equal and eating ice cream.  \n\n     O:   Stool for C. diff. and stool C&S were both negative. \n\n     P:   I asked him to discontinue artificial sweeteners and milk products,\n          except for yogurt, for 3 days.  He will call if the diarrhea persists off the\n          antibiotic.  \n\n(3)  Guaiac-positive stool on examination last week.  \n\n     O:   His hematocrit had increased to 35.7 last week.  \n\n     P:   Recheck CBC.  He will bring me the name of his GI physician at the\n          Atlantic North so that I can communicate with him about the recent events\n          and arrange for follow-up colonoscopy.  \n\n(4)  Dizziness.  \n\n     S:   This has resolved. \n\n(5)  Diabetes. \n\n     S:   He stopped glyburide as directed last week when his 4 p.m. blood sugar\n          was 44.  His fingerstick blood sugar was 192 this morning.  He reports\n          that he is eating much better.  \n\n     P:   He will restart glyburide 5 mg q.d. when his blood sugar is greater than\n          200.\n\n(6)  Systolic murmur and right bundle branch block.\n\n     P:   His echocardiogram has been requested but he has not yet received the\n          appointment.  \n\n(7)  Coronary artery disease.  \n\n     S:   He has had no chest pain.  He apparently had an appointment last week\n          for an exercise tolerance test at the Atlantic North but the technician was\n          not there.  He has another appointment later this week with the doctor\n          at the Atlantic North.\n\n     P:   I gave him a copy of the final NYSH discharge summary from his recent\n          hospitalization as well as copies of the EKGs done during the\n          hospitalization and a copy of the abdominal CT report to take to his\n          doctor at the Atlantic North.\n\n(8)  Proteinuria during the hospitalization. \n\n     O:   His serum creatinine was 1.5 (likely elevated given his age).  Repeat\n          urinalysis showed 1+ albumin with no other significant abnormalities. \n\n     P:   Check 24-hour urine for protein and creatinine.  Check serum protein\n          electrophoresis and urine immunoelectrophoresis. \n\n(9)  Chronic anemia.  \n\n     O:   He had normal iron studies, B12 and folate several months ago.  His\n          hematocrit was stable as of last week.  \n\n     P:   Check serum protein electrophoresis and urine immunoelectrophoresis.  \n\n(10) Decreased HDL.  \n\n     A:   We could either add niacin or change his statin from Mevacor to Lipitor\n          to increase the HDL.  \n\n     P:   I have deferred this issue to his primary care physician. \n\nHe will return for follow-up in 2 weeks so that we can make final arrangements for\nthe colonoscopy and to check progress with his diabetes. \n\n\n\nCiara J.

Five days PTA, the Pt became SOB while walking up the stairs to his apartment on the 3rd floor.  He took a SL NG pill which he says alleviated the SOB and allowed him to continue.  Over the next few days, his SOB became progressively worse and occurred at rest.  His SOB would awaken him from his sleep, occurring 3-4x/ night.  He states that SL NG pills alleviated his PND.  The Pt sleeps on one pillow.  During the course of his worsening SOB, his exercise tolerance decreased from a baseline of walking 2.5 hours without any SOB to walking for 1.5 hours with multiple stops due to SOB.  These episodes of SOB were not associated w/ CP (pleuritic or otherwise), palpitations, F/C, N/V, diaphoresis, abdominal discomfort, or pain in his arms or jaw.  \n\n\n\nAlso during this time, the Pt noted progressive b/l swelling of his legs (from ankles to knees) and increasing abdominal girth.  He states that his legs would pit when he pressed on them.  The LE swelling were not associated w/ calf pain.  On the day before admission, however, he did develop a non-productive, dry cough.  On the DOA, his Sx had worsened to the point where he felt like he needed to be seen by a doctor.  He was subsequently driven to NYSH-East by his wife and son, where he was seen and then re-directed to NYSH.     \n\n\n\nAt NYSH-East, the Pt's vitals were: T 97.6 P 52-55 BP 167/77 O2Sat 98% Wt 188.5# w/ clothes.\n\nThe Pt received Lasix 40mg IV and O2 @ 3L/min.\n\n\n\nAt NYSH-Ed, the Pt's vitals were: P 48 BP 157/78 RR 20 O2Sat 99% on 2L\n\nThe Pt received ASA 325mg PO. \n\nSince receiving the Lasix, the Pt's LE edema has drastically diminished, and the Pt states that he feels a lot better.\n\n\n\nThe Pt has not experienced any recent weight loss and is on a regular diet without salt restriction (he uses salt 2-3x/wk).  He also claims that he is adherent to taking his meds.\n\n\n\nPMHx:  \n\nDM\n\nHTN\n\nhyperlipidemia\n\ns/p MI - 6/93\n\nAICD - 9/93 \n\nCAD w/ LAD stent - 2092\n\nchronic anemia - Hct w/in the 30-33 range\n\ncolon cancer resection - 2078\n\ndiverticular disease\n\n\n\nMEDS:\n\nAmlodipine 7.5mg QD\n\nASA\n\nFosinopril 40mg BID\n\nHCTZ 25mg QD\n\nMetoprolol 100mg BID\n\nLipitor 10mg QHS\n\nGlucophage 1g BID\n\nGlyburide 10mg BID\n\nOmeprazole 20mg QD\n\nViagra 100mg PRN\n\n\n\nALLERGIES: oxycodone, plavix    rash\n\n\n\nSOCIAL Hx: The Pt lives at home w/ his wife (49yo in good health) and son (27yo in good health).

Although, there were no \n\nCP or calf pain suggestive of DVTs.  Consider D-dimer to rule out recent PE.   \n\n\tIschemia  - EKG and the negative set of cardiac enzymes x2 does not suggest this. However, Pt \n\nhas not had any acute Sx while on the floor. \n\nPNA - This is less likely given the lack of fever or elevated WBC.\n\nTumor - This is also less likely given the lack of weight loss, the acute nature of the symptoms, \n\nand the lacko f lymphadenopathy.\n\n\n\n1)\tSOB - Most likely CHF>PE/DVT>ischemia>>PNA,tumor; however, he currently appears asymptomatic. PE is still possible given the lack of diagnostic studies to rule out, although there were no CP or calf pain suggestive of DVTs, and the onset was not acute.  The Pt may have had an exertional ischemia but the lack of CP and EKGs changes makes this less likely; however, the Pt has been asymptomatic on the floor and so no EKG tracings concomitant with the SOB are available to completely rule out this possibility.  PNA and tumor are less likely given the lack of fevers and chills and any hx of weight loss.  \n\n\n\nWill start the Pt on O2 in addition to his normal medicinal regimen of diuretics, beta-blockers, and ACE-I.  Will consider the addition of spironolactone.  Order echo to determine EF and to identify structural myocardial changes if any.  Order LFT's to check for decreased perfusion to vital organs.  Monitor UOP for kidney functions.  Monitor EKG for any changes.  Will send for a D-dimer to r/o recent PE. \n\n\n\n2)\tHTN - Poorly controlled, may be 2o to missing meds today. Will also be treated using meds for CHF.\n\n3)\tDM - Sugars elevated.  Will treat w/ his home medication of glucophage and glyburide.\n\n4)\tHyperlipidemia - Stable. Cont home medication of Lipitor.\n\n5)\tFEN - Switch to low salt diet with no concentrated sweet.  Consider a diabetic diet as well.\n\n6)\tDispo - Will d/c once Pt is stabilized.\n\n\n\nWillie Nix, TMS III\n\nPager:  20243\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n12/10/94 Intern addendum:\n\n\n\nPatient seen and examined with med student above.  Agree with overall assessment above.  Briefly:\n\n\n\nThis is a 73M with a hx of CAD s/p MI, s/p AICD, IDDM, HTN, and hyperlipidemia, who presents with DOE, PND and bilateral leg edema x4 days.  DOE is not associated with anginal symptoms including CP, nausea, vomiting, and diaphoresis, although the patient reports it is relieved by nitroglycerine.  Physical exam findings here are notable for a flat JVP, absence of crackles, 2/6 SEM at LLSB and apex, and mild, symmetric, pitting edema in bilateral lower extremities.  Per chart notes, in clinic he was noted to have bulging neck veins.  \n\n\n\nFavor CHF >?pacer malfunction, ischemia > PE.  CHF is a somewhat confusing picture as symptoms suggest L-sided failure with pulmonary edema while there is little objective data (no crackles on exam, CXR clear) to suggest this.  Prior to our evaluation he received 40 of IV Lasix and diuresed at least one liter (with subjective improvement), which may account for this discrepancy.  \n\n\n\nPlan is for echo to evaluate his LV function, pacer interrogation, and stress.  D-dimer should be sufficient to pursue PE as this is a low-prob possibility.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNoah Escobar, MD, PhD\n\nInternal Medicineintern\n\nPager #08163"}

Says that transplant clinic wanted her to return a month after the last visit but she did not want to do so. She thinks that it was for follow-up of an elevated WBC. However, her WBC has been normal over the last several visits. \n\nNeuropathy:\tNot consistent with taking the Neurontin, and notes it she misses it.\n\nCardiac:\tNo chest pain or unusual dyspnea on exertion.

The last p-CABG ETT was done in September, 2074, and did not included nuclear images. The electrocardiographic portion of both tests was considered to be uninterpretable because of inadequate elevation of the heart rate. Dr. Dotson asked her to double the atenolol dose. Since she has had low BP in the past, we increased it to only 25/12.5. BP 80/50-90/60 at home and she has not felt so well, tired. Not sure whether the dyspnea on exertion that led us to get the ETT has changed since she has not challenged it. \n\n\n\nHome Blood Tests:  Not very good by history. A1c over 9%.

He is followed in PIMA for \nmultiple medical problems.  Refer to the problem list.\n\nHISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient reports that he was informed that he \nhad borderline diabetes in the past.  He apparently called Dr. Frantz with present poly \nsymptoms.  He was advised to come to the office for serum glucose check.  The patient \ndoes have a brother with diabetes.  To his knowledge, neither one of his parents had \ndiabetes.  The patient does not have much knowledge regarding diabetes.  He basically is \nnow complaining of polyuria, polydipsia, and weight loss.  He reports that he has had an \n18 pound weight loss since 1/78, visit with Dr. Frantz.\n\nOBJECTIVE:  Serum glucose in the office random is 376.  Weight is 173.75 pounds.  \nDiabetes instructions as follows, pathophysiology of diabetes is reviewed.  Action and \nrationale for oral agent versus insulin reviewed.  Hyper and hypoglycemic symptoms \nreviewed.  Acute and chronic complications of diabetes reviewed.  Gross no concentrated \nfruits diet reviewed.

A radiogram in December \n\nshowed that he has osteoarthritis in that hip.  He has been taking \n\nMotrin twice a day and finds that he does get some relief with that.\n\n\n\nHis left shoulder has been bothering him for awhile but it is actually \n\nis somewhat better than it has been.  It hurts to abduct him more than \n\n90 degrees or to reach behind his back.\n\n\n\nHis left wrist is bothering him some now.  It is sore with most types of \n\nmotion.\n\n\n\nRegarding his diabetes, his blood sugar today was 190 early this \n\nmorning.\n\n\n\nRegarding his coronary disease, he has been walking every morning.  He \n\nhas had no chest pain pressure or discomfort.\n\n\n\nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Blood pressure is 110/70, weight is 192 pounds, \n\npulse is 70 and regular.  He is a pleasant black man in no apparent \n\ndistress.  Neck is supple without lymphadenopathy or thyromegaly.  Chest \n\nis clear to auscultation and percussion.  Cardiac, S1, S2, regular rate \n\nand rhythm, no murmurs or gallops.  Abdomen is soft.  Extremities, \n\nwithout edema.  Right hip, no pain with leg rolling.  Left shoulder is \n\nable to abduct to 90 degrees with no discomfort at all and is able to \n\nabduct completely with only minimal discomfort.  It is nontender to \n\npalpation.  Left wrist, he is a little tender over the medial joint \n\nline.  \n\n\n\nASSESSMENT AND PLAN:\n\n\n\n1.\tRight hip:  I think he has degenerative joint disease and I want him \n\nto continue on the Motrin as needed.\n\n\t\n\n2.\tLeft shoulder:  I may well have bursitis here.  He feels this has \n\nimproved a lot and he would just as soon not do anything different \n\nfor now but will let me know if it causes more problems.\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\tIckes, Jr., William\n\n\t81071628\n\n\t02/02/79\n\n\tPage 2\n\n\t\n\n3.\tLeft wrist:  He probably also has some arthritis in his left wrist.  \n\nHe is tender in the joint line today.  It is bothering him a little \n\nbit but not enough that he would like to do anything about it.\n\n\t\n\n4.\tCoronary disease:  He has been doing well from this prospective.

Briefly, she was admitted in early April with Group B strep bacteremia and AoV endocarditis with mod to severe AI.  The source of GBS bacteremia remains unclear although she had an episode of shingles a few weeks prior and may have caused a cutaneous innoculation.  Pre-op angiogram showed no significant CAD.  On 4/5/89 she underwent composite aortic root replacement with a 20mm life net aortic homograft by Dr. Jerome.  Due to heavily calcified RCA ostium, a button for re-implantation couldn't be created so she recieved a single vessel SVG to prox RCA.  Post op course was complicated by afib with high grade AV block for which she recieved a dual chamber PPM.  She was discharged to rehab with a PICC to complete a course of IV PCN.  However, she was re-admitted in early May while still at rehab with an episode of chest pain at rest.  ECG was paced but biomarkers were mildly positive (troponin ~0.5).  TTE showed the valve was well seated without suggestion of recurrent endocarditis.  There was a new apical WMA.  She underwent cath which showed patent BPG and no significant CAD.  The episode was attributed to embolic phenomenon (? from afib, INR 1.5 on admission).  She was discharged back to rehab and has done well since.\n\n\n\nShe was seen in the ID clinic and the PICC line was pulled.  She's back home from rehab now and seems to be fairly well.  She gets fatigued easily and has to rest after walking about a 100 yards.  However, she denies CP, SOB, palpitations, presyncope or focal neurologic deficits.  No F/C or weight loss.  She has a long history of bilateral calf caludication but she isn't exerting herself enough to elicit symptoms.  While at rehab, she was sleeping on 4 pillows and would develop orthopnea if sleeping flat.  Now she's sleeping on 2 pillows for comfort and doesn't seem to have anymore orthopnea.  However, she does experience what sounds like PND a couple of times per week.  She denies LE edema.  She's tolerating all medications well.  Home BS checks have been running 90-130.\n\n\n\n\tPast medical history:\n\n   - GBS AoV endocarditis s/p aortic root replacement with 20mm homograft\n\n- PAF/SSS s/p dual chamber PPM\n\n- PVD: \n\n-> s/p R CEA; CNIs (4/89) mod 50-69% R ICA (peak vel ~250cm/s), mild L ICA stenosis\n\n-> long history of bilateral calf claudication after 10-15 mins ambulation; improved on pletal\n\n- patent foramen ovale\n\n- DM2\n\n- breast CA s/p bilateral mastectomies; on letrozole\n\n- back surgery with rod placement at MSHMC 2088\n\n- GERD\n\n\n\n\n\n\tMedications (Confirmed):\n\n\t\n\nAdvair  250/50mcg spray inh bid\n\namiodarone  200mg po daily\n\naspirin  325 mg po daily\n\nCombivent  120/21mcg/spray inh qid\n\nCoumadin \n\nFemara  2.5mg QD\n\nLipitor  20mg po daily\n\nLopressor  25mg po bid\n\nmetformin hydrochloride  500 mg po daily\n\nophthalmic pilocarpine solution  0.5% QID\n\nOs cal  500mg/125 units po bid\n\nPletal  100mg PO BID\n\nPrilosec  40mg po BID\n\nZantac  300mg po at bedtime\n\n\n\nAllergies:\n\n\t\n\nNo known drug allergy   \n\n\n\n\tSocial history:\n\n   Retired Welder, widowed, lives alone, 2 children\n\nTob - former 1 ppd x 30 yrs, quit 2079\n\nEtOH - rare\n\nDrugs - none\n\n\n\n\tReview of systems:\n\n   otherwise negative in detail\n\n\n\nPhysical examination:\n\n\t\n\n-BP: 98/66  left arm\n\n-Pulse: 70s  regular\n\n-weight: 123  lbs.\n\n-General appearance:   well appearing\n\n-Skin:   well healing mid-line sternotomy, pacer pocker C/D/I\n\n-Neck:   carotids 2+, soft R>L bruits, JVP<7cm\n\n-Chest:   decreased BS at bases, o/w clear\n\n-Cardiac:   RRR, I/VI early sys M at RUSB, no R/G\n\n-Abdomen:   soft, NT, pos BS\n\n-Extremities:   trace symmetric LE edema\n\n\n\nProcedures:\n\n\t\n\nTransthoracic echocardiogram STATUS POST EF 56%, well seated AoV bioprosthesis (peak 12, mean 6), apical WMA, normal RV fxn, L->R shunting by Doppler c/w PFO\n\n\n\n\tEKG:\n\n   A-V sequentially paced at 70\n\n\n\n\tImpression:\n\n   Overall, Ms. Kong seems to be recovering quite well after a difficult couple of months.  Her exercise tolerance is fairly poor, likely reflecting deconditioning.  To that end, I've referred her to the cardiac rehab program at Glenbeigh Hospital (closer to home).\n\n\n\nShe has occasional episodes of possible PND but no other evidence of volume overload on exam.  If her symptoms persist, I've asked her to notify me and we'll try a low dose of lasix.\n\n\n\nIn terms of rhythm issues, she is now completely paced.  She probably doesn't need amio anymore so we'll stop it today.  In terms of coumadin, it's probably reasonable to continue for 3 months following valve replacement.  She's due to see Dr. Jerome next month; we'll defer to him in terms of the duration of post-op anti-coagulation from a bioprosthetic valve perspective.  With regard to Afib, she had post-op Afib but now she's atrially paced.  If future PPM interogations don't reveal underlying Afib, she may not need coumadin in the long run.\n\n\n\nShe'll return to clinic in 6 months or sooner prn.

The\n\npatient had a plan for cardiac catheterization the day after this\n\nED visit but presented on this day for an episode of chest\n\ndiscomfort which occurred at rest, which was unlike his previous\n\nepisodes of chest discomfort which usually occurred with\n\nactivity.  He took nitroglycerin with relief and then presented\n\nfor further evaluation and treatment.\n\nMEDICATIONS:  Metformin, Toprol, Cozaar, nitro, aspirin, and\n\nAltace.\n\nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  He is awake and alert, in no distress,\n\nchest pain free.  Afebrile with pulse 72, blood pressure 129/69,\n\nand O2 saturation 98% on room air.  His lungs are clear to\n\nauscultation.  Heart:  Regular rate and rhythm.  Abdomen is soft\n\nand nontender.  Extremities are warm and well perfused.  No\n\nelevated JVP.\n\nEMERGENCY DEPARTMENT COURSE:  An EKG was done revealing right\n\nbundle-branch block, but sinus rhythm at 67 with no ischemic\n\nchanges.  IV access was established.  Labs were sent revealing\n\nessentially normal CBC and electrolytes.  Initial troponin was\n\nless than assay with an INR of 1.1 and chest x-ray, which was\n\nnormal.  The patient has been taking aspirin prior to arrival. \n\nHeart rate was in the 60s in the emergency room and no additional\n\nbeta-blockade was given to the patient.  However, based on his\n\nstory, which was suggestive for unstable angina, he was given\n\nLovenox in the emergency room.  I spoke to the Cardiology B\n\nattending on call who agreed to take the patient on to his\n\nservice for probable cardiac catheterization in the near future. \n\nWith this plan, he was admitted in stable condition with a\n\ndiagnosis of unstable angina.\n\nCRITICAL CARE TIME:  50 minutes.\n\n______________________________\n\nYERGER, DESEAN MD\n\nD: 08/01/60\n\nT: 08/01/60\n\nDictated By: YERGER, DESEAN\n\neScription document:0-0255081 BFFocus\n\n ******** Not reviewed by Attending Physician ********\nRecord date: 2060-07-28\n\n\n\n\nGIPSON, ALEC\n32707420\n07/28/2060\n\n\nVernon Lozano, M.D.\nCV Division, Ireton Medical Clinic\n91 Neptune Lane\nAbilene, FL  81494\n\nDear Vernon,\n\nI write to summarize for your records the recent IMC course of your patient, Dr. Alec Gipson, who was admitted to our cardiology service on 07/25/2060 with progressive angina and a small, non-ST elevation MI.  His cardiac troponin rose to 0.13.  There were no demonstrable ECG changes, though we queried the possibility of a left circumflex event.  He had been previously scheduled for semi-urgent catheterization and angiography on 07/26/2060.\n\nHis condition stabilized with institution of anti-thrombotic and anti-ischemic therapy.  He was taken to the catheterization laboratory by Dr. Otero on 07/26/2060.  Angiography demonstrated a high-grade lesion in the proximal portion of a large first diagonal branch, as well as a significant stenosis in the first obtuse marginal branch.  The diagonal lesion was managed with angioplasty and deployment of a drug-eluting stent.  A drug-eluting stent could not be delivered to the obtuse marginal lesion; a bare-metal stent was positioned without difficulty.  He did have smoldering chest discomfort of an anginal nature following the procedure.  The cardiac troponin elevated further to a peak value of 0.86 as of 07/27/2060 (08:54).  He also had a mild, vagal reaction characterized by flushing and transient bradycardia.\n\nHe felt much improved the following day.  A repeat cardiac troponin returned at a lower level of 0.75.  An abdominal ultrasound showed no evidence of an AAA.  After consultation with you, we felt that he could return home, under the care of his wife.\n\nHe was discharged on the afternoon of 07/27/2060.  His medications included Ecotrin 325 mg daily, clopidogrel 75 mg daily, losartan 100 mg daily, metformin 500 mg b.i.d., Toprol-XL 50 mg b.i.d., niacin 500 mg b.i.d., ramipril 2.5 mg daily, and nitroglycerin if needed.\n\nPlease let me know if I can provide you with any further information.\n\nSincerely yours,\n\n\n______________________________\nVictor Quijano, M.D.\n\n\n\n\n\neScription document:6-5332849 DFFocus\n\n\n\nDD: 07/28/60\nDT: 07/29/60\nDV: 07/28/60\nRecord date: 2061-01-31\n\nEDVISIT^32707420^GIPSON, ALEXANDER^01/31/61^VELASQUEZ, WALTER\n\nThis patient was seen by myself and Dr. Hardin on 01/31/2061.

He says although this\n\nwas quite significant, it was not like his prior MI discomfort. \n\nHe denies any radiation to his back or his arm.  He denies any\n\njaw pain.  He denies any fever, chills, or sweats.  He denies any\n\nvomiting.  He denies any headache or neck pain.  He denies any\n\nbowel or bladder changes and no lower extremity edema.  He is\n\ntaking his medicines.  He also took an aspirin, did get some\n\nnitroglycerin.\n\nPAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Diabetes, hypertension,\n\nhypercholesterolemia, and CAD.\n\nMEDICATIONS:  Cozaar, aspirin, Altace, metformin, and Toprol.\n\nALLERGIES:  He has no known drug allergies.\n\nSOCIAL HISTORY:  He is a past smoker, not a drinker or drug user.\n\n He lives with his family.\n\nREVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  As noted in the HPI, otherwise negative.\n\nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  He is in no acute distress at rest.  He\n\nsays his chest pain is essentially gone on oxygen.  Vital signs\n\nare as noted.  Head, eyes, ears, nose, and throat:  Normocephalic\n\nand atraumatic.  Pupils are equal and reactive to light. \n\nExtraocular motions are intact.  Oropharynx is unremarkable. \n\nNeck is supple.  There is no jugular venous distention.  Chest is\n\nclear to auscultation.  Heart is regular rate and rhythm.  His\n\nabdomen is soft and nontender.  There is no hepatosplenomegaly. \n\nThere are no masses.  His skin is warm and dry.  There is no\n\nlower extremity edema.  He has equal pulses.  His neuro exam is\n\nalert and oriented to person, place, and time.  His cranial\n\nnerves are intact.  He is grossly nonfocal.\n\nLABORATORY DATA:  He has a white count of 8, hematocrit of 46,\n\nand platelet count of 200,000.  His SMA-7 is unremarkable.  CK-MB\n\nand troponin are flat and INR is 1.  His EKG shows less than 1 mm\n\nST depressions in V2, without any reciprocal or other changes.\n\nASSESSMENT:  The patient with a history of CAD with concerning\n\nsymptoms.  He did have a fight earlier in the day, although was\n\nnot under significant stress at the time of this event.  Given\n\nhis prior CAD history, the patient was given Lopressor.  Decision\n\nwas made to admit him for rule out acute coronary syndrome.  The\n\npatient was admitted in stable condition.  The patient had\n\nalready got an aspirin and the patient remained in stable\n\ncondition until he was admitted.\n\nDIAGNOSIS:  Rule out acute coronary syndrome.\n\n______________________________\n\nVELASQUEZ, WALTER M.D.\n\nD: 01/31/61\n\nT: 02/01/61\n\nDictated By: VELASQUEZ, WALTER\n\neScription document:9-1137686 BFFocus\n\n ******** Not reviewed by Attending Physician ********\nRecord date: 2063-01-17\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGIPSON, ALEXANDER\n32707420\n01/17/2063\n\n\n\n\nUlysses Peralta, M.D.\n82 March Street\nCoalinga, FL  84635\n\n\nDear Dr. Peralta:\n\n\nI saw your patient, Dr. Gipson, in the Cardiology Office today on a somewhat urgent basis.  He was recently in Italy last week with very difficult events concerning his father's ill health.  His father ultimately died and was a very traumatic series of days for Dr. Gipson and his family.  He developed left chest discomfort, which persisted for a number of days.  He was afraid to take nitroglycerin despite knowing that he should, and therefore remained with chest discomfort for about six days.  He was able to be reasonably active and had no exacerbation of his chest discomfort.  He had no nausea, vomiting, diaphoresis, or palpitations.  He then returned to the United States and his symptoms have resolved.  Because of these discomforts, he wanted to undergo an additional evaluation.\n\n\nWe performed an exercise treadmill test with perfusion imaging two days ago for better understanding of his symptoms.  He exercised for 7 minutes and 30 seconds on the standard Bruce protocol to a peak heart rate of 122 beats per minute (84% of maximum predicted for age) and peak blood pressure of 162/80.  He stopped because of dyspnea and had some discomfort.  The discomfort resolved into recovery.  He had no ST segment changes.  His perfusion scan demonstrated normal LV size and normal tracer uptake in the lungs.  There was normal RV size as well.  There was a small-to-medium medium-sized defect of moderate intensity in the mid and basal inferior wall that was reversible.  These were no different than the prior study he had in July 2061.\n\n\nAs you may remember, in January 2061, he underwent cardiac catheterization that demonstrated the presence of non-major flow-limiting obstructions and so no intervention was performed.\n\n\nHis current medical regimen includes ramipril 5 mg b.i.d., aspirin 162 mg daily, Cozaar 50 mg b.i.d., Crestor 10 mg daily, fish oil 500 mg b.i.d., metformin 500 mg b.i.d., multivitamins, niacin 500 mg daily, Plavix 75 mg daily, Toprol-XL 100 mg b.i.d., HCTZ 12.5 mg daily, and Nexium.\n\n\nOn exam today, he is comfortable with a blood pressure of 135/75, a heart rate of 60 and regular, and weight of 189 pounds.  Head and neck are unremarkable.  Chest is clear.  Cardiac exam shows no jugular venous distention at 30 degrees.  PMI is normal.  S1 and S2 are normal with a physiologic split.  There is an S4 and 1/6 systolic ejection murmur at the left sternal border.  Abdominal exam is unremarkable without organomegaly.  Bowel sounds are normal.  The extremities show no edema or cyanosis.  Carotid upstrokes are normal in contour and volume without bruit.  Distal pulses are normal.\n\n\nHis resting 12-lead electrocardiogram demonstrates normal sinus rhythm and normal morphology.\n\n\nI think Dr. Gipson is basically doing very well.  I think his chest discomforts for six days while in Italy may be related to anxiety and perhaps the known gastroesophageal reflux disease that he has.  I think there is no evidence that the discomfort was cardiac in origin.  His exercise capacity is quite good and his perfusion is actually somewhat even improved from his prior evaluation two years ago.  I think we can maintain our current approach.  I suggest that I see him in a number of months for future evaluation.\n\n\nIf any problems develop in the interim, please do not hesitate to contact me.  Thank you for allowing me to help with his care.\n\n\nKindest regards.\n\n\nSincerely yours,\n\n\n\n\n______________________________\nVernon A Lozano, MD\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\neScription document:9-1764070 IFFocus\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDD: 01/17/63\nDT: 01/18/63\nDV: 01/17/63"}

He is presently requiring insulin in the setting of the stress of surgery.  Meticulous BG control is important in the post-operative period.  The goal is to maintain BS<175.  He should remain on the Portland Protocol until at least POD #3.  At that point only if he is fully stabilized and eating well can he be transitioned on to an alternative regimen.  He may transiently require subcutaneous insulin but will ideally be able to resume dietary control of DM.\n\n\n\nThank you for allowing us to participate in the care of this patient.

It diminishes only slightly as the day progresses.  He denies any numbness, weakness, tingling, changes in vision or memory.  He denies any recent URI.  He does report tinnitus which has been present intermittently for years as well as bilateral sensorineural hearing secondary to gunshot exposure.  No NV. The sensation of vertigo is superimposed upon one week of gradually progressive loss of balance, described as not knowing where to put his limbs in relation to space.  He also reports ~7 days of mild diarrhea in a.m only, attributable to eating sorbitol ice cream as well as continuing to take Metamucil for the same 7 day period.  Diarrhea has been fully resolved for 2 days PTA. He does report good PO fluid intake, ~8 bottles of H20 per day.  He monitors his sugars regularly and reports they have been running in the 110-140s. He denies any fevers, chills, sweats or sick contacts.  The patient does have ptosis on the L and reports that this has been present less than one month.  He has had no changes in medications.\n\n\n\nAdditionally, the patient reports one episode of fleeting chest pain along the midaxillary line on 07/12 which was relieved immediately by NTG.  (Pt attributes the pain to gas as the belching coincident with the NTG also seemed to relieve the pain).  He does also report an increase in SOB after walking up one flight of stairs which has arisen over the past few months.\n\n\n\nPMH: \n\nDM x 20 years, peripheral neuropathy\n\nHTN\n\nCAD\n\nAnteroseptal MI in 03/91, PTCA and stent\n\nEF 32% (last echo 2092)\n\nHemorrhoids (normal colo 2095)\n\nIritis, corneal dystrophy\n\nOsteoporosis\n\nDiverticulosis (?)\n\n\n\nMeds:  \t\n\nGlipizide 2.5 QD\n\nAsa  325 QD\n\nLisinopril 5mg QD\n\nLopressor  50 mg BID\n\nLipitor  10 mg QD\n\nAmitryptilline  25 mg QHS\n\nPrednisone gtt\n\nCaltrate + D (CALCIUM Carbonate 1500 Mg (600 Mg Elem Ca)/ Vit D 200 Iu)  1 TAB PO BID\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAll:  \tAcetaminophen--rash\n\n\n\nSH:  \t\n\n\tTob:  \t43 year pack hx, quit 2060\tEtOH:\tdenies\tIllicits:\t denies\n\n\n\nFH:  \tMother:  pernicious anemia\n\nFather:  died in accident at young age\n\nBrother:  leukemia\n\n\n\nROS:\t\n\nAs in HPI.  \n\n-\tGeneral: no weight loss/gain, no fatigue, no fevers, no chills, no change in appetite\n\n-\tRespiratory: no cough, no SOB, no DOE, no hemoptysis, no wheezing\n\n-\tHEENT: no neck stiffness, no hoarseness, no hearing loss\n\n-\tCardiac: chest pain/pressure as above, no palpitations, no orthopnea, no PND\n\n-\tGastrointestinal: no nausea, no vomiting, no diarrhea, no constipation, no bleeding\n\n-\tNeurologic: diminished sensation in LLE bilaterally\n\n-\tLymph nodes: no enlarged lymph nodes\n\n-\tMusculoskeletal: No back pain, no neck pain, no leg pain, no arm pain\n\n-\tUrologic: No hematuria, no dysuria, no polyuria, no nocturia \n\n-\tHematologic: No bruising, no bleeding\n\n-\tExposures: No sick contacts, no recent travel  \n\n\n\nExam:  \t \n\n\tVS:  \t97.7  74 18  98%  supine 108/54 standing 127/70\n\nHEENT: NC/AT, PERRL, nonicteric.

He has a hx of iritis and retinitis recently treated with steroids.  He follows-up with the Rusk State opthamologists. For foot care he sees a podiatrist at the RSH as well. There is no history of diabetic ulcer or cellulitis. He is maintained on glyburide 2.5mg for several years and he checks his BS qd with range of 100-150 and occasional episodes of hypoglycemia. His last AIC was 4.4% in 9/95. At this time his UA showed no proteinuria and his renal function is within normal limits. He is on an ACEi. His diabetic care is well managed at the Diabetic clinic by Whitney Bullock. \n\nP: c/w glyburide and current endocrine/optho/podiatry care.\n\n\n\nAtherosclerotic coronary vascular disease\n\nS: Mr. Jacobs has a hx of anteroseptal MI in 2092 and is s/p left main stent placement. In July of 2095, he had a TTE which was remarkable for an EF of 23%, reduced from 31% in 2092. Also notable for anteroseptal AK and infero-posterior HK. AD-MIBI in 9/95 with anteroseptal scar, but no ischemia. Does about 30 minutes of aerobic physical activity each morning without issue. No CP or SOB. Denies orthopnea, PND, LE edema. \n\nP: DM (AIC 4.4) and lipid control (LDL 59) is optimal. Medical Regimen consists of  ASA, BB, ACEi, Statin. Is a patient of Dr. Dunham and plan to see him annually. I wonder if he should be anticoagulated given his diffuse HK and whether he should be considered for BiV pacing.\n\n\n\n\n\nHealth maintenance\n\nCAD: please see problem list\n\nTob: quit 25 years ago\n\nEtOH: neg \n\nExercise: intensive exercise regimen, but limited as of late by neuropathy \n\nDiet: eats fruits/vegetables; minimal salt, fatty foods    \n\nColon CA: Spring 2095 with normal colonoscopy\n\nProstate CA: next due for prostate exam in 7/96.

The first episode started this AM (10AM). It was left sided with out radiation non positional or pleuritic. Denies any associated sx such as palpitations, SOB, n,v. Although he has had a mild cough with throat irratation over the past few days.  He was attributing this pain to gas but he took an aspirin and (expired) nitroglycerine SL just in case. He had an anteroseptal MI in 2092 and when questioned he does not feel this pain is similar to his prior attack.  Later that day he had another episode of pain for which he felt more worried about, called the EMS for evaluation of a cardiac cause of his pain. On route to the Hospital the EMS gave SL nitro which relieved the pain. He was evaluated in the ED where he had EKG, cardiac enzymes and was given his normal dose of beta blocker. His EKG when compared showed evidence of his old anterior septal MI, possibly slightly inverted T waves in I,AVL and deeper T wave  inversions in V1-3. \n\nFirst 2 sets of cardiac enzymes have been normal and he has remained CP free since the last nitro. \n\n\n\nROS:   No F/C/NS.

She was seen with a very complete evaluation \n\nby Ida Oquinn for her recurrent urinary tract infections.  She submitted a\n\nurine sample initially that appeared fairly clean but then after straight cathing her\n\nurine Ida was able to obtain cloudy foul smelling urine.  A fair amount retained\n\nas postvoid residual.  Ms. Hendrickson completed her 14 days of Levaquin with\n\nresolution of her symptoms but now over the past few days she has noticed an odor\n\nand cloudiness to her urine again without fevers of dysuria or urinary urgency.  She\n\nhas anxiety associated with the possible reasons why she should have recurrent\n\ninfections.  She is most concerned about having cancer.  She is scheduled to see Dr.\n\nQuezada March 24th.  The patient reports increased anxiety of late as there have\n\nbeen issues going around the housing projects.  A 14-year-old girl was raped and\n\none week later an individual was climbing a tree to try to get into her apartment. \n\nShe ended up combating him with a broom and he ran away.  She did not file a\n\npolice report.  As a result of this she has had more problems with her anxiety.  She\n\nreports compliance with all her medications except that she ran out of her Lasix\n\napproximately one week ago.  She had been taking 20 mg one-half to one tablet\n\nsporadically but not on a regular basis.  She denies any chest pressure or\n\npalpitations.  She denies any shortness of breath.  She denies any problems with\n\npain in her right foot or increased swelling of her left ankle.\n\n\n\nPHYSICAL EXAM:  Blood pressure is 156/90.  Heart is regular rate and rhythm. \n\nNo murmurs, gallops or rubs.  UA reveals positive nitrate and 2+ leukocytes.  Her\n\nankle reveals trace edema on the left.  Her right extremity is warm to palpation.  \n\n\n\nASSESSMENT AND PLAN:  \n\n\n\n(1)  Hypertension.  Blood pressure has been high over the past two visits.  This\n\n     may be due to the fact that she has not been taking her Lasix.  I have\n\n     restarted her on the Lasix 20 mg to take one-half tablet q.d. on a regular\n\n     basis.  \n\n\n\n(2)  Anxiety.  I will write a letter for her to the Rupert Housing Council to try\n\n     to get her moved out of this current housing project to a safer environment.\n\n\n\n(3)  Recurrent urinary tract infections.  She had a urine culture submitted today. \n\n     She was given another prescription for Levaquin 150 mg one PO q.d.  She\n\n     will stay on this until her appointment with Dr. Quezada.  I attempted to\n\n     reassure her that it is unlikely that cancer is the cause for her current\n\n     recurrent infections.  It is more likely due to her cystocele.\n\n\n\n(4)  Peripheral vascular disease.  This appears stable.  She remains off the\n\n     cigarettes.  \n\n\n\n(5)  ASCVD.  She remains without symptoms.  \n\n\n\n(6)  GERD.  She remains on the Prilosec.\n\n\n\n(7)  Hyperlipidemia.  She remains on Lipitor.  She should have a repeat\n\n     cholesterol obtained with a new primary care physician in the fall.\n\n\n\n(8)  Borderline high sugar.  The patient should also have this rechecked with the\n\n     new physician in the fall.\n\n\n\nMary Isham, M.D.\n\n\n\nMI/ussery/echols\nRecord date: 2092-11-16\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\nTeam D Intern Admission Note\n\nDate: 11/16/92\n\n_______________________________________________________________________\n\n\n\nCC/HPI:\n\n\n\nPt is 76 yo F with h/o CAD, HTN, hypercholesterolemia, COPD, many pack-years of smoking, and anxiety who presents with c/o SOB.\n\n\n\nPt was in her usual state of health about 1 week PTA, when she noticed gradually worsening SOB and developing cough productive of scant whitish sputum.

Pt reports no dietary discretions and excellent adherence to medications. She was out evening of admission at a social gathering and noticed symptoms when she returned home and had difficulty climbing an internal staircase in her home She ascended the staircase and was unable to regain her breath. She reports she developed profound dyspnea and tachycardia. She denies chest pain, diaphoresis, dizziness or LOC. She has had a cough productive of clear sputum x 1 week with no fever, night sweats, rigors or chills during this time. She has had no vomiting or diarrhea. She does not recall wheezing, and asserts the only symptoms during the episode consisted in SOB and tachypnea.\n\n\n\nOf note, pt had 2 vessel CABG in 11/92. Catheterization on 11/18/92 revealed 100% obstruction of the left proximal circ, 70% proximal LAD obstruction, and 100% obstruction of the mid RCA. \n\n\n\nCourse in ED:\n\nEn route to BBH pt received Lasix 40 mg, TNG x 3. She was described as pale, cool, and diaphoretic. She was unable to complete full sentences. She received Lasix 40 mg IV and 20 mg IV 2 hours later, ASA 325 x 1, Zofran 8 mg IV, and 0.5     nitropaste. Initial vitals were T 98 P 93 BP 148/67  RR 24  93 % on 6 L and 100% on BiPap (brief).\n\n\n\nPMHx: \n\n1. HTN\n\n2. CAD [old MI by EKG/imaging]\n\n3. COPD \n\n4. Hypercholesterolemia \n\n5.

In addition, I personally\n\ninterviewed and examined this patient.\n\nHISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 65-year-old female who\n\npresents for evaluation of chest pain.  The patient had no\n\nhistory of coronary artery disease until the last week.  She was\n\napparently in Pennsylvania where she had been for the last week.  She\n\nhad been having 5 days of epigastric and substernal discomfort. \n\nShe considered it to be indigestion and have been taking Tums. \n\nAfter approximately 5 days while in Pennsylvania, she felt that the\n\ndiscomfort was not improving.  She did feel like that she had\n\nless energy for her usual activity.  She went to a hospital there\n\nin her land of Pennsylvania where she was noted to have a positive\n\ntroponin.  She underwent a diagnostic catheterization that did\n\nshow multivessel disease with an occluded LAD.  She subsequently\n\nunderwent a therapeutic PCI with stenting of her LAD.  She did\n\nhave recurrent chest pain today after catheterization, which was\n\nmuch more severe, sharper in nature per her description.  She was\n\ntold in the hospital in Pennsylvania that this was due to reperfusion.\n\n She returned home today, called her primary care physician and\n\nwas advised to come to the Emergency Department for evaluation. \n\nShe does state that since discharge from the hospital in Pennsylvania\n\nearlier this week, she has had intermittent episodes of more\n\nsevere left anterior chest pain, which she describes as somewhat\n\nmore sharp than the indigestion feeling she was experiencing\n\nbefore.  It is not always associated with exertion.  It sometimes\n\nradiates to her left shoulder.  It is not pleuritic in nature. \n\nIt seems to be intermittent, although she does have a low level\n\nof dull aching pain, which has been fairly constant since her\n\ndischarge from Pennsylvania.  She denies any shortness of breath.  She\n\nis able to lie flat.  Denies any lower extremity edema.\n\nPAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Positive for type 1 diabetes, which is\n\nfairly brittle per her report.  She is status post MI within the\n\nlast week.  She also has a remote history of PE in the past and\n\nis no longer on Coumadin.\n\nSOCIAL HISTORY:  She does not smoke.  She lives with her husband\n\nand has recently returned from Pennsylvania.\n\nFAMILY HISTORY:  Reviewed and is also positive for CAD.\n\nREVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  All other systems are reviewed and are also\n\nnegative except per the HPI.\n\nMEDICATIONS:  Include insulin, Plavix, aspirin, Nexium, Lipitor,\n\nand atenolol.\n\nALLERGIES:  The patient has allergies to iodine and Indocin.\n\nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Her temperature is 98.6, her pulse 65,\n\nrespirations 18, and blood pressure 105/69.  The patient is\n\nawake, alert, pleasant female who is reclining in no acute\n\ndistress.  Her head examination is normocephalic and atraumatic. \n\nHer pupils are equal and reactive to light.  Her sclerae are\n\nanicteric.  Her conjunctivae are pink and moist.  She has moist\n\nmucous membranes and appears well hydrated.  Her neck is supple\n\nand nontender with full range of motion.  The JVP is not\n\nelevated.  Her lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally with\n\nequal breath sounds, no respiratory distress.  No accessory\n\nmuscle use and no chest wall tenderness.  Her cardiac examination\n\nis regular rate and rhythm with no murmur, rub, or gallop.  Her\n\nabdomen is nondistended, soft, and nontender.  No guarding, no\n\nperitoneal signs, and no organomegaly.  Her skin is intact, warm,\n\ndry, and slightly pale.  There are no rashes.  Her back is\n\nnontender with full range of motion.  Extremities reveal no\n\ncyanosis, clubbing, or edema.  Her calves are soft and nontender\n\nwith no palpable cords and full range of motion with normal\n\nstrength and tone.  She is alert and oriented x3, very pleasant. \n\nCranial nerves are intact, and there is no motor or sensory\n\ndeficit.  Rectal examination performed by the resident reveals\n\nheme-negative stool with normal tone.\n\nEMERGENCY DEPARTMENT COURSE:  The patient was placed on a cardiac\n\nmonitor.  IV access was maintained.  Laboratory studies were sent\n\nand EKG was also ordered.  Her prior records from Pennsylvania were\n\nreviewed.  Her white blood cell count is 8.4, hematocrit 37, and\n\nplatelets 285,000.  Her electrolytes are within normal limits. \n\nHer BUN is 18, creatinine 0.8, and glucose 112.  Her CK here\n\nreturned normal at 33.  Her MB was 0.4.  Her troponin returned\n\nelevated at 0.39.  This is in comparison to the troponin from her\n\nrecords of Pennsylvania, which was 0.2.  Her d-dimer is less than 200.\n\n Her INR is 1.1.  The patient had an EKG, which showed evidence\n\nof a new T-wave inversions, present on prior EKG from this\n\nhospital.  She was started on heparin for concern of unstable\n\nangina status post MI, remained hemodynamically stable, and is\n\nadmitted to the Cardiac Service.\n\nDIAGNOSIS:  Chest pain, rule out unstable angina.\n\n______________________________\n\nCONNER, VICKIE M.D.\n\nD: 11/08/85\n\nT: 11/08/85\n\nDictated By: CONNER, VICKIE\n\neScription document:6-4710513 BFFocus\n\n ******** Not reviewed by Attending Physician ********\nRecord date: 2085-12-07\n\n\n\n\nZASTROW, IRENE\n42521583\n12/07/2085\n\n\nDATE OF ADMISSION:  12/06/2085.\n\nThis 66-year-old woman phoned my office complaining of exertional chest discomfort.  We instructed her to presented to the Emergency Department at Davis Monthan Hospital.  She had experienced multiple episodes of chest pressure with exertion lasting 5-10 minutes and radiating to her left axilla.\n\nOn 10/30/2085, she suffered non-ST segment elevation myocardial infarction in Pennsylvania and was managed with percutaneous coronary intervention.\n\nChest discomfort recurred and on 11/03/2085, she was recatheterized at Davis Monthan Hospital where her mid LAD stent was expanded.\n\nShe has had worsening substernal chest discomfort over the past two to three days.  Her discomfort is relieved with nitroglycerin.  Overnight, she had on and off chest discomfort with anterior T-wave lability.  She was placed on intravenous heparin and intravenous nitroglycerin.\n\nShe suffered pulmonary embolism in 2074.   That is when I first met her.  She has gastroesophageal reflux disease.\n\nShe is married; her husband works at 24 Hour Fitness as a personal trainer in the weight room.  She does not smoke cigarettes.  She has four children.\n\nHome medications include aspirin 325 mg daily, atenolol 25 mg daily, Lipitor 80 mg daily, Plavix 75 mg daily, insulin, and sublingual nitroglycerin as needed.\n\nThe review of systems is negative other than the above.\n\nOn physical examination, she appears well.  Afebrile, blood pressure 126/82 mmHg, heart rate 72 and regular, and respiratory rate 13 per minute.  HEENT is normal.  The neck veins are not distended.  The chest is clear.  On cardiac examination, she has a regular rhythm with a normal S1, single S2, and no murmur, rub, or gallop.  Abdomen has no masses or hepatomegaly.  The legs have no clubbing or cyanosis, but there is right leg greater than left leg edema.  The skin has no rash.\n\nMy assessment is that Irene Zastrow has \"small vessel\" coronary artery disease in addition to epicardial coronary artery disease.  We will intensify her medical regimen by prescribing higher doses of beta blockade and by initiating a long-acting nitrate.  We will also repeat the chest CT scan to make sure she has not suffered from recurrent pulmonary embolism.\n\nI discussed this plan with her, her husband, and the medical house staff.\n\n\n______________________________\nVictor Z.

At that time, she had a drug-eluting stent placed in her left anterior descending coronary artery.  On 11/03/2085, she had repeat percutaneous coronary intervention because of persistent chest pain and required an additional inflation and reexpansion of the drug-eluting stent.  On 12/07/2085, she had repeated cardiac catheterization because of chest pain but no additional percutaneous coronary intervention was required.\n\n\n\nShe feels that she is having less chest discomfort as we have \"ramped up\" her cardiac medications.  She has no shortness of breath.  She does get occasional abdominal pulsations.  She does get epigastric discomfort.\n\n\n\nCurrent medications include ranolazine 1000 mg twice daily, aspirin 325 mg once daily, Plavix 75 mg once daily, isosorbide mononitrate 30 mg once daily, Lipitor 20 mg daily, and insulin.\n\n\n\nThe review of systems is negative other than the above.\n\n\n\nOn physical examination, she appears well.  Weight 165 pounds, blood pressure 109/73 mmHg, heart rate 77 and regular, respiratory rate 14.  HEENT:  Normal.  The neck veins are not distended.  The chest is clear.

Breast examination reveals no masses or galactorrhea.  Cardiovascular exam, PMI in the mid clavicular line, normal S1, S2, no murmurs, rubs, or gallops.  Abdominal exam:  Normoactive bowel sounds, soft, nontender, nondistended, no hepatosplenomegaly or abdominal masses noted.  Anoscopy did not reveal any hemorrhoids.  Neck exam reveals no jugular venous distention.  Carotids are 2+ with normal upstrokes.  Thyroid is 20 g without nodules.  Extremities are without clubbing, cyanosis or edema.  Neurologically, she is alert and oriented x3 and has a grossly nonfocal exam.\n\nASSESSMENT AND PLAN:\n1.  Ms. Zastrow is a 67-year-old woman who comes in today with review of her type 1 diabetes.  She is doing much better on the pump than she was before especially with the recent adjustments we made.  We will continue with the pump and she will continue to send me her blood sugars every two weeks until we get this under control.  We will check a hemoglobin A1c today.  She is up-to-date with the remainder of her health maintenance including seeing a podiatrist and an ophthalmologist as we had prescribed.\n2.  Cardiovascular.  She is doing well on her current regimen.  She is on ranolazine and will continue with this.\n3.  Neck pain.  Intermittent neck pain is most likely from degenerative disease.  I did not find anything on neurological exam that was concerning.  I did encourage her to actually take some Naprosyn as needed for this pain, but not to take it on a continuous basis for long periods of time.  She has had some problems with some blood in the stool and I feel that she is due for colonoscopy.  I did recommend that she get one in the near future.  \n\nADDENDUM:  A pelvic exam was with normal appearing female external genitalia.  Normal vaginal vault, no adnexal fullness felt.  Vaginal Pap was taken.  Greater than 50% of our 60-minute visit was spent going over her pump settings, the appropriate levels for her pump, going over her diet, going over her bowel habits and her etiology of possible blood in her stool.\n\n\n______________________________\nIva P Hall, MD\n\n\n\n\n\neScription document:9-9269277 CSSten Tel\n\n\n\nDD: 04/19/87\nDT: 04/19/87\nDV: 04/07/87"}

As you know, he is a patient that has known coronary artery disease, for which I ended up doing a catheterization on 08/27/2157, and that was done because of an abnormal stress test and chest pain.  At that time, he had been evaluated by Dr. Morgan Thayer, who performed a stress MIBI and demonstrated an inferoposterior ischemia, a low workload of 3 minutes and 18 seconds, and a heart rate of only 72% of predicted.  The LV chamber was dilated, and the ejection fraction was estimated at 48%, and there was a suggestion of global ischemia.  The catheterization demonstrated the presence of moderate diffuse coronary artery disease, plaque distributed throughout much of the coronary tree, some calcification, and narrow caliber vessels overall, but no focal high-grade stenoses.  There was some disease in the distal left main coronary artery, but his angina or ischemia was felt to be on the basis of excess demand in the phase of globally diminished supply.\n\n\n\nHe was treated medically for the coronary artery disease.  At the time of his cath, he also underwent an angiography of his abdominal aorta and selective angiogram of his left leg, because he was complaining of claudication predominantly on the left calf at that time.  That study demonstrated the presence of two renal arteries of the left side, a small superior one that was narrowed by about 50%, and a larger inferior left renal artery that was narrowed by about 60%.  The right side was patent.  With respect to the abdominal aorta, there was an ulcerated plaque just below the superior renal artery, narrowing the channel in the aorta by about 30% or 40%.  The iliac vessels were patent, and the left common femoral artery had some irregularity that was patent.  The left SFA, a diffusely diseased vessel, had a high-grade stenosis of about 80% in the adductor canal.  Then, at the trifurcation, there was occlusion or high-grade stenosis of all three trifurcation vessels on the left side.  There was reconstitution at the level of the ankle.\n\n\n\nThe decision at that time was made to treat him conservatively, at least for the present, since he was still playing golf three to four times a week.  He also apparently had some other issues, so I never saw him again in followup.  The original plan had been to bring him back for revascularization of his left renal artery and the left SFA.\n\n\n\nHe did have back surgery about a year ago when he became significantly crippled by his lumbar spinal stenosis.  Dr. Anders Sykes performed an L3-L4, L4-L5 decompressive laminectomy.  This had a dramatically positive effect on his back pain.\n\n\n\nThe biggest problem now is that he feels that he cannot walk as far and his exercise tolerance has decreased.  He has been an avid golfer in the past, but is now having some more difficulty with that.  Even when I saw him two years ago, he was using a cart to play three or four times a week.  He still is able to play golf, but if he walks about 100 yards, he starts feeling his calves, and now the symptoms are bilateral and equal.  He also has some numbness in his toes, which is constant, and his feet feel cold much of the time.  The symptoms of claudication have increased over the past couple of years.\n\n\n\nHis blood pressure has been reasonably stable.  He tells me that you get pressures of 120-130.  He has not been taking his blood pressure at home, but he does take a fair amount of medication, see below.\n\n\n\nOf note, his son says that when he was in Michigan, he was playing 18 holes of golf regularly, sometimes a couple of times per day, but Haas notes that he was indeed limited by claudication even though he was able to play the golf down in Michigan.  He seems to be more limited up here since returning just a short time ago.  He also says that he feels like he has got to stay on the move, and if he does not play any golf at all, he will really deteriorate.  Of note, the discomfort is not only limited to the calves, but also there is some discomfort in the hips, though not nearly as bad and not as limiting.\n\n\n\nOf note, he has been seeing Dr. Youngman for his legs and has been told to \"walk walk walk.\"  At this point, he feels that he cannot walk as well or enough to follow through on his instructions.\n\n\n\nPast medical history:\n\n   As above.\n\nOthers include the following:\n\n1.  Diabetes, type 2.\n\n2.  Hypertension, with blood pressures as high as 220 at times in the past.\n\n3.  Carotid bruits, though I do not have any readings from a Duplex ultrasound that was done a couple of years ago or so.\n\n4.  Hyperlipidemia.\n\n5.  Remote history of smoking, quit 40 years ago or so after 20 years of smoking.\n\n6.  Peripheral neuropathy.\n\n7.  Coronary artery disease, as described.\n\n8.  Renal artery stenosis and PVD.\n\n\n\nCurrent Medications:\n\n  Avandia 4 mg QD\n\n Prilosec 20 mg QD\n\n atenolol 150 mg QD\n\n Imdur 60 mg QD\n\n lisinopril 40 mg QD\n\n Lipitor 5 mg QD\n\n metformin hydrochloride 500 mg 4 tabs qd\n\n glyburide 5 mg 2 tabs qd\n\n aspirin 325 mg QD\n\n Tricor 54 mg 1 tab qd\n\n Norvasc 5 mg QD\n\n Plavix 75 mg QD\n\n nitroglycerin PRN\n\n Lasix 40 mg QD\n\n\n\nSocial history:\n\n   He used to run a catering company.  Currently retired.  Plays golf a lot.  Likes to maintain a high level of activity.  Has two sons, one in Lake Wildwood, another in Baldwin City.  He has a daughter in Michigan.  Grandchildren - several.  He also has a great grandchild.\n\n\n\nNo smoking currently and only drinks occasional beer.  Occasional cup of coffee.\n\n\n\nReview of systems:\n\n   Positive for edema, 1+ in both legs.  He denies neurologic symptoms, sweats, fever, chills, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, bloody stools, or hemoptysis.  He does have night cramps and frequent urination at night.  He says he has some problems with vision with some intermittent blurring of his vision, but no monocular blindness.  He is set up to see an ophthalmologist soon.\n\n\n\nPhysical examination:\n\n-Pulse:   64 and regular\n\n-BP: 160/65    by my nurse, but I retook it at 130/60\n\n-General:   He is a well-appearing gentleman, looks younger than his age of 82 years\n\n-Heent:   Normal.  EOMI.  PERRL\n\n-Neck:   Carotid upstrokes normal.  Bilateral bruits present, soft.  No JVD\n\n-Chest:   Clear\n\n-Cardiac:   Normal S1 and S2, soft S4, and a grade 1-2/6 murmur in the left lower sternal border\n\n-Abdomen:   Soft, positive bruit, no organomegaly, and no enlargements of the aorta\n\n-Extremities:   Femoral pulses 2+, bilateral bruits.  Below this, feet are warm and well perfused, with 1+ edema bilaterally.  Trace pulses in the dorsalis pedis on both sides, not sure how well I am feeling them.  Popliteal pulses are trace to 1+.  No ulcers or gangrene.  No tissue loss\n\n\n\nEKG:\n\n    - normal sinus rhythm at 64.  Normal axis and intervals, very minor nonspecific ST-T wave abnormality, essentially normal tracing.\n\n\n\nOther Data:\n\n   Date of Birth:  01/22/2077\n\n\n\nAssessment and plan:\n\n   1.  Obtain MRA of abdominal aorta, renal, and run-off arteries down to the ankle.  This will help give us a road map as to how we can approach revascularization of his legs to make him feel better.  I already know that I can open up his left SFA and probably his left trifurcation vessels below the knee, but I would like to see the right side and also get another look at the aortoiliac vessels, since it has been a full two years.\n\n2.  Continue appropriate risk factor modification as you are doing.\n\n3.  We will obtain blood work today in preparation for revascularization.\n\n4.  I need to get carotid noninvasive studies, since it has been a couple of years anyway.\n\n\n\nImpression:\n\n   1.  Peripheral arterial disease - progressive claudication, now involving both legs at an equal amount and limiting him in terms of daily activities.  We know that he has high-grade disease in the left leg, below the groin, which can be treated.  Right leg has not been examined in the past.  Also has an ulcerative plaque in the aorta, which might be best left alone.\n\n2.  Renal vascular disease - known moderately severe stenosis left main and accessory renal arteries.  Blood pressure is under reasonable control.  Need to check his creatinine and BUN.  If they are okay, then we would leave him alone.  He is however on a total of six antihypertensive medications, so consideration of renal artery revascularization is certainly something to entertain.\n\n3.  Coronary artery disease - stable.\n\n4.  Diabetes.\n\n5.  Spinal stenosis - better since back surgery.\n\n\n\nChanges to Medications this visit\n\nAvandia 4 mg   QD\n\nPrilosec 20 mg   QD\n\natenolol 150 mg   QD\n\nImdur 60 mg   QD\n\nlisinopril 40 mg   QD\n\nLipitor 5 mg   QD\n\nmetformin hydrochloride 500 mg 4 tabs  qd\n\nglyburide 5 mg 2 tabs  qd\n\naspirin 325 mg   QD\n\nTricor 54 mg 1 tab  qd\n\nNorvasc 5 mg   QD\n\nPlavix 75 mg   QD\n\nnitroglycerin     PRN\n\nLasix 40 mg   QD\n\n\n\nThank you so much for allowing me to participate in the care of this nice gentleman.  I will certainly keep you updated as to his clinical course.\n\n\n\nSincerely,\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMark Diamond MDCC: ; Morgan F Thayer M.D.\n\n\n\nSigned electronically by   Mark  Diamond MD  on  Jun 6, 2159\nRecord date: 2164-06-26\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\nWFP Gastroenterology                                                                     K.

Mr. Joshi presents with a complaint\n\nof dyspnea and oxygen requirement.  The patient does relate that\n\nhe has had breathing problems in the past and in fact, markedly\n\nworse several years ago.  However, with the treatment of his\n\ncoronary artery disease, he had been doing somewhat better until\n\nhe underwent surgery for a carotid artery stenosis.  Since that\n\nsurgery several months ago, he has had a prolonged period of time\n\nduring which he has required supplemental oxygen.  At the same\n\ntime, the patient is being treated for congestive heart failure\n\nand in fact, has had a recent increase in his dose of standing\n\nLasix.  The patient relates that during his hospitalization, he\n\ndid have what sounds like a pleural effusion, which a physician\n\ndid try to drain, however, unsuccessfully.  At the current time,\n\nMr. Joshi is feeling slowly better and feels as though he is\n\nable to take a deep breath, which he was unable to do several\n\nmonths ago.  In fact, he was told recently that he does not need\n\nsupplemental oxygen.  He denies a chronic cough, although he does\n\noccasionally have some difficulty swallowing which leads to\n\ncoughing.\n\n \n\nHis past medical history includes diabetes, carotid artery\n\nstenosis, coronary artery disease with both angioplasty and stent\n\nplacement, congestive heart failure, bladder cancer,\n\nhypertension, hypercholesterolemia, gastroesophageal reflux, and\n\nupper GI bleed.\n\n \n\n \n\nRE:  Peter Joshi\n\n     MR #453-39-84-4                -2-                 02/24/70\n\n \n\nHis medications include aspirin, Lasix, Isordil, Zestril,\n\nLopressor, simvastatin, Norvasc, Prevacid, a multi vitamin,\n\npotassium, albuterol, Atrovent, Serevent, and insulin.\n\n \n\nHe has no known drug allergies.  He discontinued cigarette\n\nsmoking years ago.\n\n \n\nOn exam today, he had a blood pressure of 122/60.  His pulse was\n\n56, afebrile.  O2 sat on room air initially was at 90%, but when\n\nI rechecked it, it was 95%.  His weight was 221 lbs.  He is in no\n\nrespiratory distress at rest.  His oropharynx had dry mucosa and\n\na somewhat small posterior pharyngeal air space.  His neck had no\n\nenlarged lymph nodes.  Chest had diminished breath sounds in the\n\nleft base with crackles.  His right lung was clear.  His heart\n\nwas in a regular bradycardic rhythm with a II/III systolic\n\nmurmur.  His abdomen was protuberant, but benign.  His\n\nextremities are with 1+ pitting edema and no clubbing.  Pulmonary\n\nfunction testing had been performed in December and was repeated\n\nagain today, which demonstrates that he has a combined\n\nrestrictive and obstructive ventilatory defect.  His current\n\nvital capacity was improved approximately 10% from that of\n\nDecember.  He has no bronchodilator response.  I took Mr. Joshi\n\nfor a short walk and he never desaturated below 92% and that\n\nincludes after walking up one flight of stairs.\n\n \n\nIn summary, I believe that Mr. Joshi has dyspnea which is likely\n\nmostly related to congestive heart failure and deconditioning. \n\nHowever, I do believe he might have a pleural effusion based on\n\nmy exam and based on his history and therefore, I have referred\n\nhim to have a decubitus chest film taken.  Mr. Joshi had several\n\nquestions related to his metered dose inhaler use and I have\n\nrecommended that he use only Combivent 4x a day regularly.  I do\n\nnot believe there is any benefit to be gained from an inhaled\n\ncorticosteroid for this gentleman.  I do recommend that he get\n\ndaily exercise.  He certainly needs to continue his diuresis and\n\nI will certainly check his chest x-ray on the outside chance that\n\nhe may benefit from            a pleural effusion.  I have also\n\nconfirmed to him that he no longer requires supplemental oxygen. \n\nHis pulmonary function testing also had demonstrated a reduced\n\ndefusion capacity, however, it does correct when accounting for\n\nalbuterol volume and therefore do not believe that he is likely\n\nto have either an interstitial lung disease or pulmonary \n\nRE:  Peter Joshi\n\n     MR #453-39-84-4                -3-                 02/24/70\n\n \n\nvascular disease.  However, we will certainly reassess this after\n\nhis initial work-up.  Thank you for referring this interesting\n\npatient.

He has had no shortness of breath at rest.  He\n\nhas noticed no significant change in his lower extremity edema. \n\nHe has mild orthopnea and no paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea.  His\n\nmedical regimen includes aspirin 325 mg PO q.d., Lasix 80 mg PO\n\nb.i.d., Isordil 40 mg PO b.i.d., Zestril 40 mg PO b.i.d.,\n\nLopressor 100 mg PO b.i.d., simvastatin 20 mg PO q.d., Norvasc 5\n\nmg PO b.i.d., Prevacid 20 mg PO q.d., and K-Dur 25 mEq q.d. in\n\naddition to albuterol, Atrovent, and Serevent.\n\n \n\nHis physical exam is notable for a blood pressure of 150/70 right\n\nand left arm seated.  After rest, this comes down to 135/70 right\n\nand left arm seated.  His heart rate is 70 and regular. \n\nRespiratory rate is 10.  His room air saturation is 95%.  His\n\nlungs are clear to auscultation, although breath sounds are\n\nsomewhat distant.  Cardiovascular exam is notable for\n\nnondisplaced PMI and a soft systolic ejection murmur.  His\n\nabdomen is soft and nontender.  Extremities are notable for edema\n\nto his knees bilaterally.\n\n \n\nRE:  Peter Joshi\n\nMRN: 453-39-84-4            -2-              June 06, 2070 \n\n \n\nElectrocardiogram is notable for sinus rhythm with an axis of -14\n\nand normal intervals, no evidence of ischemia or infarction.

This lovely gentleman with ischemic heart disease and \n\ncongestive heart\n\nfailure has been followed in our clinic since the time of his carotid \n\nendarterectomy and cardiac\n\nprocedure.  At the present time, he notes that he has been very minimally \n\nactive because of the\n\nflooding.  He has had no paroxysms of chest discomfort.  He has had no exertional \n\nneck, chest, arm\n\nor jaw pain.  He has had dyspnea on exertion at greater than 4 METS of \n\nactivity and he does\n\nhave mild lower extremity edema.\n\n \n\nHis medical regimen includes aspirin, Demadex, isosorbide, Lopressor, \n\nsimvastatin, Norvasc,\n\nPrevacid, multivitamins, potassium chloride and insulin.  \n\n \n\nOn physical examination, his weight is 223 pounds.  His blood pressure is \n\n124/60 right and left\n\narm seated.  His heart rate is 54 and regular.  Respiratory rate is 10.  \n\nThere is a mild increase in\n\njugular venous pressure.  Carotids are without bruits.  Lungs are actually \n\nclear to auscultation\n\nthroughout.  Cardiovascular exam is notable for a systolic ejection murmur \n\nbut no gallop is\n\npresent.  His abdomen is soft, nontender, free of organomegaly and bruits.  \n\nExtremities are\n\nnotable for symmetric pulses somewhat diminished at the level of the \n\nposterior tibialis and mild\n\npitting edema to the midshin bilaterally.  \n\n \n\nHis electrocardiogram is sinus bradycardia with inverted T waves in I and L.  \n\nNo significant\n\nchange from prior electrocardiograms.\n\n \n\nIn summary, Patrick Joshi looks like he is in mild volume overload at the \n\npresent time.  He reports\n\nthat he has had renal insufficiency in the past.  Before adjusting his \n\nDemadex dosing, I will\n\nreassess his kidney profile.   \n\n \n\n \n\nRe:  Peter Joshi\n\nMR #45339844             -2-                 February 13, 2071\n\n \n\n \n\nIf there are any other thoughts or questions in the care of this lovely \n\ngentleman, please feel free\n\nto give me a call.\n\n \n\nSincerely,\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nCorrine James-Wagner, M.D.\n\n \n\n/hartman\n\n \n\n \n\n ******** Not reviewed by Attending Physician ********\nRecord date: 2071-07-30\n\n \n\nEDUCARE-FARGO Cardiovascular Division\n\nCVD ER2\n\n21 Aberdeen Lane                                      JOSHI, PETER\n\nEtowah, CA 62884                                           45339844\n\n(297) 823-0872                                           07/30/71\n\n \n\n \n\nLeon F Craft, M.D.\n\n135 Tamworth Place\n\nGarnett, CA 47749\n\n \n\nDear Dr. Craft,\n\n \n\nI had the pleasure of seeing Peter Joshi in the Cardiovascular Division on Tuesday.

The patient states he has been \n\nfeeling unwell for the past three days and has noticed his heart \n\nracing.  He actually has had his significant other take his heart \n\nrate and blood pressure while he was at home, and his readings have \n\nbeen in the 1 teens to 120s.  The patient has had a decreased \n\nappetite with vomiting and nausea as well as chest tightness in his \n\nmid-chest.  The patient felt himself get worse, and he, therefore, \n\npresents to the emergency department.\n\nREVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  As per the written note.\n\nPAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Insulin dependent diabetes mellitus.\n\nMEDICATIONS:  Insulin.\n\nALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.\n\nSOCIAL HISTORY AND FAMILY HISTORY:  As per the written note.\n\nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  This is a well-developed, well-nourished \n\nmale in moderate distress.  Pulse 160-177, respiratory rate 40, \n\nblood pressure is 130/68, oxygen saturation is 100% on room air.  \n\nNECK:  Supple, full range of motion, no jugular venous distension.  \n\nCARDIAC:  Regular, tachycardic, no murmur is auscultated, clear S1 \n\nand S2.  LUNGS:  Positive rales at the bases, otherwise clear, good \n\nair movement, tachypneic.  NEURO:  Alert and oriented x 3, follows \n\nall commands appropriate.  Further details of the exam are as per \n\nthe written note.  \n\nLABORATORY EVALUATION:  Labs are significant for a glucose of 322, \n\nBUN of 31, creatinine of 1.8, bicarbonate of 19, CK of 186, MB of \n\n4.0, troponin of 1.11, calcium of 9.9.  White count of 15.6, \n\nhematocrit of 47.6, platelets of 206.  PT of 14.0, PTT of 29.0.  \n\nEKG shows wide complex, regular, tachycardia.\n\nTHERAPY RENDERED/COURSE IN ED:  The patient was seen, interviewed \n\nand examined in the emergency department with labs obtained and as \n\ndocumented above.  In addition to the above studies, the patient \n\nhad a chest x-ray which shows increased pulmonary vasculature.  The \n\npatient's EKG along with his history is concerning for a \n\nventricular tachycardia.  The patient, therefore, initially \n\nreceived amiodarone.  The amiodarone affected no change in the \n\npatient's heart rate.  The patient remained tachypneic and \n\ntachycardic and generally well appearing.  The decision was made to \n\nproceed with cardioversion.  The patient received morphine and \n\nAtivan and had a synchronized cardioversion once at 52 volts with \n\nimmediate change to sinus tachycardia in the 1 teens.  The patient \n\nstated that his chest tightness resolved immediately following \n\ncardioversion.  The patient received aspirin, beta-blockers, oxygen \n\nand heparin while in the emergency department.  He is on amiodarone \n\ndrip.  Individuals from the Cardiac Service were contacted \n\nregarding possibly getting the patient to the catheterization lab \n\nespecially in light of his ruling in for a myocardial infarction.  \n\nThe plan at this time is for the patient to be admitted to the CCU, \n\nbe observed and then to proceed to cardiac catheterization \n\nthereafter.\n\nCONSULTATIONS (including PCP):  Cardiac Service.\n\nFINAL DIAGNOSES:\n\n1.  Myocardial infarction.\n\n2.  Ventricular tachycardia.\n\nDISPOSITION (including condition upon discharge):  The patient is \n\nadmitted in satisfactory condition.  Critical care time is 70 \n\nminutes.\n\n___________________________________                    PY989/54741 \n\nKATHLEEN IRELAND, M.D.       KI30                        D:05/09/21 \n\n                                                       T:05/10/21 \n\nDictated by:  KATHLEEN IRELAND, M.D.       KI30 \n\n ******** Not reviewed by Attending Physician ********\nRecord date: 2125-07-28\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHOLCOMB, DENNIS\n\n83312060\n\n07/28/2125\n\n\n\n\n\nHISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Dennis Holcomb is a lovely 57-year-old gentleman with a past medical history notable for coronary artery disease, status post myocardial infarction with known ventricular tachycardia with AICD in place.  He continues to work at Alaska Air and has multiple family obligations which are stressful to him.  He has had no exertional neck, chest, arm, or jaw pain.  He has not felt his AICD fire.  He has had no lightheadedness or weakness.  He continues on atenolol, aspirin, folate, furosemide, insulin, lisinopril, simvastatin and Viagra.\n\n\n\nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  On exam today, his weight is 224, heart rate is 74 and blood pressure is 120/77.  There is no increase in jugular venous pressure.  Carotids are without bruits.  Lungs are clear to auscultation throughout.  Cardiovascular exam is notable for nondisplaced PMI, S1, physiologically split S2 with systolic ejection murmur and a soft holosystolic apical murmur.  Abdomen is soft, nontender, free of organomegaly and bruits.  Extremities are warm and free of edema with symmetric pulses, motor strength, and sensation.\n\n\n\nLABORATORY DATA:  EKG is notable for sinus with evidence of prior inferior myocardial infarction.\n\n\n\nASSESSMENT AND PLAN:  In summary, Dennis has been doing well with respect to his blood pressure control and exercise.  Given his current levels of stress, we are going to change his atenolol to 100 mg in the morning and 50 mg at night, and I have encouraged him to get to a target weight of 190 this year, and I am making no other changes in his medical regimen.\n\n\n\n\n\n______________________________\n\nEvelyn Maxwell-Johnston, M.D.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\neScription document:5-3853809 IFFocus\nRecord date: 2128-02-26\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLynchburg City Health Department\n\n7609 New Hampshire Avenue\n\nKigali, NJ  47798\n\n497-045-1949\n\n\n\nHOLCOMB, DENNIS\n\n83312060\n\n02/26/2128\n\n\n\nDATE OF BIRTH:  12/14/67\n\n\n\nCHIEF COMPLAINT:  He presents today for his annual history and physical after an absence to this office for the past 2 years.\n\n\n\nPAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Includes poorly controlled type 2 diabetes, currently on insulin for the past 33 years, history of left foot infection, erectile dysfunction, onychomycosis of toenails, hyperlipidemia, CAD, inferior myocardial infarction complicated by ventricular tachycardia, obesity, diabetic retinopathy, ischemic cardiomyopathy and low testosterone.\n\n\n\nPAST SURGICAL HISTORY:  Include cardiac catheterization, coronary stenting and implantable cardiac defibrillator.\n\n\n\nDRUG ALLERGIES:  He has no known drug allergies.\n\n\n\nMEDICATIONS:  Include atenolol 100 mg in the morning and 50 mg in the evening, aspirin 81 mg 2 tablets daily, folic acid 1 mg daily, furosemide 40 mg daily, NPH 40-42 units once daily, regular insulin for sliding scale, lisinopril 5 mg daily, multivitamin once daily, simvastatin 20 mg at bedtime, B12 250 mcg by mouth daily, vitamin C 1000 units daily, and over-the-counter cholesterol-lowering medication.\n\n\n\nFAMILY HISTORY:  Father and brother died of cerebral aneurysms, both were hypertensive and smokers, there is also history of cardiac disease in his grandparents.\n\n\n\nSOCIAL HISTORY:  Single, works for the Alaska Air Group in Juneau, drinks 1-2 beers a year.  He is a nonsmoker, does not use IV drugs, he is responsible to take care of several sick individuals that are very close to his life, therefore he claims he cannot attention to his own personal health because of caring for others.\n\n\n\nHISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient presents today for annual physical.  The patient states he has become enlightened recently that when he goes to Tim Horton's, they pretreated his coffee with sugar as a role and he thinks that is the reason for his diabetic, lack of control over the years.  He has been eliminating concentrated sweets in his diet.  After a while, his blood sugars have gotten much better by his report.  He recently had an eye examination showing stable background retinopathy without any recent changes.  He has had no active podiatry issues over the past 2 months has had no recent chest pain, shortness of breath or PND.  He sees Dr. Isaac Ulibarri for a cardiomyopathy standpoint.  With his AICD everything seems to be working fine according to him when they interrogate his device.  He reports no fever, shakes, chills, nausea, vomiting or diarrhea.  Again, he has had no recent chest pain, PND, or orthopnea.  He has had no dysphagia, odynophagia, melena, hematemesis, hematochezia, dysuria, hematuria or polyuria.\n\n\n\nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Blood pressure is 126/70 in the right arm, temperature 95.6, pulse 78, respirations are 16, O2 sat 97% on room air.  He is 67 inches tall, 222 pounds.  BMI 34.8.  HEENT:  Normocephalic, atraumatic, pupils are equally round and reactive to light and accommodation.  Extraocular movements were intact.  He has had minimal wax buildup bilaterally.  TMs were intact.  Oropharynx was clear without erythema or exudate.  Sinuses were nontender.  Nostrils were patent.  Neck is supple Supple without JVD, lymphadenopathy or thyromegaly.  Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally without wheezes, rubs or rhonchi.  Heart regular rate and rhythm, normal S1, S2, no murmurs, rubs or gallops were appreciated.  Abdomen is soft, nontender, nondistended.  He has a small umbilical hernia that is not protruding and bowel sounds are active.  He has no organomegaly and there is no CVA tenderness.  Extremities are without clubbing, cyanosis or edema.  He does have significant thickening and brittleness of the toenails of both feet consistent with onychomycosis.  He has no open sores of the feet.  Neurologically, he is alert and oriented x3 and grossly nonfocal with intact distal sensation to light touch in both feet.  He has no generalized lymphadenopathy and his joint examination shows no effusions or erythema.\n\n\n\nASSESSMENT AND PLAN:\n\n1.  Annual physical, preventative maintenance.  The patient had a colonoscopy in 2125 and was told to come back in 2130 because of benign polyps.  I did recommend guaiac stool cards today for home testing purposes.  Immunizations are up-to-date.  He did receive an H1N1 and a seasonal flu vaccine through his employer and for private pharmacies.  His Pneumovax is due to be a booster in 2 years' time.  We are recommending a PSA and a DRE annually starting today.  Labs were also drawn in the office for CBC, CMP, and lipid profile.  The patient is declining Zostavax at this time.  We will recommend a followup in 1 year for an annual physical.\n\n2.  Poorly controlled type 2 diabetes.  The patient has now eliminated concentrated sweets from his diet, although I do suspect dietary noncompliance beyond table sugar.  Recommend checking a hemoglobin A1c today, urine for microalbumin, lipid panel and creatinine as well as a BUN and a GFR.  I would recommend continuing his insulin NPH 42 units daily, but we may need to recommend an endocrine consult if his A1c remains elevated despite dietary improvement.  We did recommend aggressive weight loss and exercise as this is a major impediment to his glucose control.  I would recommend follow up in 3 to 4 months.\n\n3.  Obesity.  We will check a TSH, lipid panel and glucose to ensure that he is in good metabolic balance.  I do suspect continued poorly controlled diabetes given his past history.\n\n4.  CAD with history of DVT.  He has had an ICD interrogated recently.  We will check a lipid panel today.  We would like to strive for an LDL less than 70 given his high risk status, I would recommend changing his steroid to a higher dose if required at that point.\n\n\n\n\n\n______________________________\n\nRobert Lincoln, M.D.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\neScription document:0-37751462 JSSten Tel\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDD: 02/26/28\n\nDT: 02/26/28\n\nDV: 02/26/28\nRecord date: 2129-02-19\n\nLee County Community Hospital0021 New Hampshire AvenueKigali, NJ  47798497-045-1949 \n\n\n\n\n\n\nDennis Holcomb\nMedical record #83312060\nDate of visit-February 19, 2129\n\n\n\n\n \nDate of birth: December 14, 2067\n\n\nChief complaint: The patient presents today in follow up for his diabetes and coronary disease, as well as a reevaluation of his recent left proximal humeral fracture\n\n\n\n\nProblems\nDiabetes mellitus type 2 : insulin requiring\nH/O left foot infection \nErectile dysfunction \nOnychomycosis \nHyperlipidemia \nCoronary artery disease \ninferior myocardial infarction \nH/O Ventricular tachycardia \nObesity \ndiabetic retinopathy \nischemic cardiomyopathy \nlow testosterone \nPolyp of colon \nFracture of humerus \n\n\nProcedures\nCardiac catheterization \nCoronary stent : rca stent, ptca of diagonal\nImplanted cardiac defibrillator \n\n\n\n\nAllergies\nNKA \n\n\nMedications\nAtenolol 100 MG (100MG TABLET Take 1) PO QAM, to be taken in conjunction with 50 mg tab at qhs #90 Tablet(s)\nAtenolol 50 MG (50MG TABLET Take 1) PO QHS, to be taken in conjunction with 100 mg qam #90 Tablet(s)\nEnteric Coated Aspirin (ASPIRIN Enteric Coated) 81MG TABLET DR Take 2 PO QD #Tablet(s)\nFolate (FOLIC Acid) 1 MG (1MG TABLET Take 1) PO QD #Tablet(s)\nFurosemide 40 MG (40MG TABLET Take 1) PO QD #90 Tablet(s)\nInsulin Nph Human 40 UNITS SC QD #4 Bottle(s)\nInsulin Regular Human Variable (100 U/ML VIAL ML) SC #2 Bottle(s)\nLisinopril 5 MG (5MG TABLET Take 1) PO QD #90 Tablet(s)\nMvi (MULTIVITAMINS) 1 TAB PO QD\nSimvastatin 20 MG (20MG TABLET Take 1) PO QHS #90 Tablet(s)\nUltram (TRAMADOL) 50 MG TABLET PO Q4-6H PRN pain, 1-2 tabs before bedtime and as needed, max of 300 mg per day #60 Tablet(s)\nVitamin B12 (CYANOCOBALAMIN) 250 MCG (250 MCG TABLET Take 1) PO QD #Tablet(s)\nVitamin E (TOCOPHEROL-DL-ALPHA) 1000 UNIT CAPSULE PO QD #Capsule(s)\n\n\nFamily / Social History\nCerebral Aneurysm:\n       Relative: Father;\nHypertension:\nCardiac:\n       Relative: Grandmother, maternal;\n       Relative: Grandfather, maternal;\n\n\nSocial history: Engaged, does not smoke, drink or use drugs, works as a architect at the Alaska Air Group in Juneau\n\n\nHistory of Present Illness: The patient presents today for follow up of his diabetes and heart disease, and to follow up as well as recent proximal humeral fracture that will not require surgery per his orthopedic specialist. The patient fell down a couple weeks ago on ice and landed on his left shoulder, sustaining a proximal humeral fracture that is currently well aligned. The patient was seen by orthopedics at the Boulder County Hospital, he was told to have no work for the next 3 months. He also received reports no chest pain, PND or orthopnea, he also denies any AICD firing, and reports only occasional low blood sugar reactions. He has a history of poorly controlled type 2 diabetes, he currently uses NPH insulin 42 units daily with sliding scale to 3 times a day at a maximal 8 units at a time. He reports no polyuria or polydipsia. His only risk doctor for fracture includes a low testosterone diagnosed about 3 years ago. He is currently on no replacement for testosterone, and only recently started calcium and vitamin D after his fracture. He has not had an eye examination in over a year.\n\n\n\n\nPhysical Examination: \nVital SignsBP 118/62, P 74, RR 16, Temp 98.3 F, Ht 70.5 in, Wt 225 lb \n\n\nO2 SAT 97\nBMI 31.9\n\n\nHEENT: Normocephalic, atraumatic, pupils are equally round and reactive to light and accommodation, oropharynx is clear without erythema or exudate, tympanic membranes are clear without erythema or effusions, sinuses were nontender, nostrils are patentNeck: Supple, without JVD, lymphadenopathy, thyromegaly, and both carotids were 2+ without bruitsLungs: Clear to auscultation bilaterally, without wheezes, rubs or rhonchiHeart: Regular rate and rhythm, normal S1, S2, no murmurs, rubs or gallops were appreciatedAbdomen: Soft, nontender, nondistended, bowel sounds were active, there is no organomegaly, there is no CVA tenderness, and there was no suprapubic tendernessExtremities: There is no clubbing, cyanosis, or edema notedNeuro: Alert and oriented x3, all cranial nerves are intact, motor is 5 out of 5 throughout, sensory examination is intact to light touch throughout, reflexes were 2+ throughout, and gait was normalSkin: There were numerous small skin tags of the neck bilaterally, and extensive ecchymotic area in the left upper arm in the setting of his recent humeral fractureLymphatic: There is no lymphadenopathy presentMusculoskeletal: There is discrete tenderness of the left proximal humerus with extensive ecchymosis extending to the elbow\nAssessment and Plan: 1. Proximal humeral fracture-the patient will be out of work for 3 months, and is really taking calcium and vitamin D twice a day, and strong he recommended a bone density test for future should fracture assessment given his low testosterone 3 years ago, the patient is not willing to schedule it today, but will call me in the next month to do so he is on Ultram on a p.r.n. basis with good relief of pain and he did not tolerate oxycodone well initially\n2. Poorly controlled type 2 diabetes-will recommend hemoglobin A1c, lipid profile, and urine for microalbumin as well as a TSH, and considered poor the patient from NPH to Lantus or possible to 70/30 insulin, with the patient might ask her benefit with formal endocrine consultation given his poor glycemic control and history of cardiac disease.\n3. CAD-will check his lipid panel tonight, aiming for an LDL of below 100\n___________________________Robert Lincoln, M.D."}

As you know, this is a \n\n63-year-old male with a\n\nlong past medical history which includes diabetes, coronary artery disease, \n\nperipheral vascular\n\ndisease, hypertension, smoking history, hypercholesterolemia, DVT and newly \n\ndiagnosed\n\nesophageal carcinoma.  He has been followed by his cardiologist, Yehuda \n\nLanders, for the last nine\n\nyears.  Essentially he has every cardiac risk factor and known coronary \n\nartery disease which is\n\ndocumented on cardiac catheterization performed on 1/20/93.  The \n\ncatheterization demonstrated\n\nright dominant system with 100% RCA lesion, a complex 30% diagonal 1 lesion \n\nand a 30%\n\nmarginal 1 lesion.  There was collateral flow noted from the LAD to the right \n\nPDA and from the\n\nseptal 2 branch to the RCA, and from the circumflex artery to the RCA.  The \n\nprocedure was\n\nperformed through the right radial artery without complications.  Patient \n\nalso has peripheral\n\nvascular disease and is status post a left femoral posterior tibial saphenous \n\nvein bypass graft in\n\n2088.  He is also status post atherectomy and dilatation of stenosis in the \n\nfemoral to posterior\n\ntibial graft.  He also had a left leg DVT in 2090.  His activity level is \n\nlimited by his claudication. \n\nHe has a history of hypertension and hypercholesterolemia and diabetes on \n\ntreatment.  \n\n \n\nAt baseline he has dyspnea on exertion after walking half a mile.  He gets \n\nchest pressure one to\n\ntwo times a month.  However, his activity is extremely limited.  He reports \n\nthat he has had a\n\npositive stress test.  Further information is not available.  Patient \n\nunderstands he has coronary\n\ndisease, however does not have amenable disease for angioplasty.  On \n\ncatheterization he had\n\npreserved ejection fraction of 62%.  \n\n \n\nHe is to undergo esophageal cancer surgery in the next one to two months \n\nafter receiving\n\nchemotherapy and radiation therapy preop.  Patient states he will be \n\nreceiving a Hickman\n\nMichael Ogrady\n\nPage 2\n\nMarch 3, 2093\n\n \n\ncatheter and a jejunostomy tube placement before his chemo and radiation \n\ntherapy. \n\n \n\nOn physical exam, the patient is obese, weighing 288 pounds.  His blood \n\npressure is 100/72,\n\nheart rate is 57 bpm.  HEENT: oropharynx benign.  Neck: carotids intact \n\nbilaterally without\n\naudible bruits.  Lungs: distant breath sounds.  Cor: without obvious jugular \n\nvenous distention. \n\nHeart sounds distant.  Normal S1 and S2.  No appreciable murmurs.  Abdomen: \n\nunable to palpate\n\nfirm masses or aortic aneurysm.  Bowel sounds present.  Extremities: status \n\npost surgery to the\n\nleft flank with 1 to 2+ edema to the knee.  Distal pulses are absent.  Neuro: \n\nintact.\n\n \n\nEKG: Sinus brady with first degree AV block.  IMI with age undetermined.  \n\nNonspecific STT\n\nwave abnormalities present.  No previous EKG for comparison.\n\n \n\nImpression: 63-year-old diabetic, hypertensive male with known coronary \n\nartery disease and\n\nperipheral vascular disease who has preserved left ventricular function.  He \n\nclearly has ischemia\n\non a positive stress test.  I would recommend dobutamine echocardiogram to \n\ncheck ischemic\n\nthreshold.  He is clearly at intermediate risk for a perioperative cardiac \n\nevent.  However, given\n\nhis life-threatening esophageal carcinoma, patient wants to proceed with \n\nsurgery even\n\nunderstanding possible complications.\n\n \n\nPlan:\n\n1.   Dobutamine echocardiogram to check ischemic threshold.\n\n2.   Recommend intravenous beta-blockers during the surgery with fairly tight \n\ncontrol of\n\n     blood pressure and heart rate, utilizing the information determined on \n\ndobutamine\n\n     echocardiography.\n\n \n\nThank you for allowing me to participate in the care of your patient, Michael \n\nOgrady.  Please do\n\nnot hesitate to contact me if you have any questions.\n\n \n\nSincerely yours, \n\n \n\n \n\nSusan Ximena Elias, M.D., M.M.S.C.\n\n \n\n/alvarado\n\n \n\n ******** Not reviewed by Attending Physician ********\nRecord date: 2095-12-24\n\n\n\nGrafton State Physician Group\n\n567 Derby Circle                                    OGRADY, MICHAEL\n\nTbilisi, OR 91623                            28297534\n\n575-433-3737, 128-526-1384                                           12/24/95\n\n\n\n\n\nHISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Mr. Ogrady is a 66-year-old gentleman who is coming in to Grafton Clinic to establish care and to discuss several medical issues.\n\n1.  Pain.  He has whole body pain, mostly in his abdomen and his leg, and this has been longstanding for 2 years' time.  Has been treating with Percocet initially at about 3-4 per day but most recently, as high as 6 per day and in fact, 6 per day is the average.  He was seen in the pain clinic and was started on Neurontin.  It is unclear how compliant he has been with that regimen.  Dr. Hoover has been renewing his Percocet prescriptions.  He has had a CAT scan done in the past because of a history of esophageal cancer, which showed no evidence of cancer or no other etiology for his pain.\n\n2.  Esophageal cancer status post resection by Dr. Patton.  He has been doing okay from that standpoint, is followed up with Dr. Yan.  The last CT scan was in June 2095 that showed some pulmonary nodules and a renal cyst that needed followup.  He has not yet had a repeat CT scan that was scheduled for yesterday, and he did not go to the appointment because he wants to do it at the Cancer Center where he feels more relaxed.\n\n3.  Coronary artery disease.  He is status post an MI in 2084.  He has had several angiograms but no angioplasties by his report.  He is followed by Dr. Mckee at the Trimont Health Care Center.\n\n4.  Status post fem-pop bypass of the left side.  He says he has been having increasing pain over the last several years on that side, which is why he takes the Percocet.  \n\n\n\nPAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Significant for coronary artery disease and diabetes mellitus with unclear control.  His last hemoglobin A1c was 6.5 and that was in 10/94.  Status post cholecystectomy, status post appendectomy, esophageal cancer status post resection, and history of idiopathic thrombocytopenia.\n\n\n\nMEDICATIONS:  Diovan 80 mg p.o. b.i.d., metformin 1000 mg p.o. b.i.d. diltiazem 240 mg p.o. q.d., Lipitor 20 mg p.o. q.d., Prilosec 20 mg p.o. b.i.d.

He used to smoke, quit in 2084.  Smoked for 20 years 2 packs per day.  No alcohol, no drugs.  \n\n\n\nFAMILY HISTORY:  Mother died of cancer, unclear what type.  Father died of an MI and had diabetes mellitus.\n\n\n\nREVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  Comprehensive review of systems was done and reveals that that he has chronic abdominal pain that is unchanged, occasional chest pain, and chest palpitations that has been evaluated by his cardiologist.  No fevers or chills.  No burning or pain with urination.  The rest of the review of systems was negative.\n\n\n\nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Today, his blood pressure is 122/80 and his pulse is 80.  His height is 6 feet and his weight is 230 pounds.  In general, he is in no acute distress.  He is well appearing.  Sclerae are anicteric.  Conjunctivae noninjected.  Pupils equal, round, and react to light.  His extraocular are movements intact.  Oropharynx is without erythema or exudate.  Oral mucosa is moist.  Neck has no significant lymphadenopathy.  JVP is flat.  His thyroid is within normal bilaterally.  Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally.  Good aeration, good air movement, no accessory muscle use.  Cardiac exam is regular rate and rhythm, normal S1, S2.  He has a systolic murmur, which has been reported previously.  His abdominal exam is soft, nontender, nondistended.  He has a large central hernia.  He has several surgical scars.  His extremities, he has no edema, his DP pulses are 1+ bilaterally.  His reflexes are trace in the knees, toes are downgoing.  His skin exam, he has multiple nevi, some that are rather dark.  No specifically suspicious lesion.\n\n\n\nIMPRESSION AND PLAN:  A 66-year-old gentleman with multiple medical issues.\n\n1.  Diabetes, recheck hemoglobin A1c today.  He is going to find out when the last time it was he had an eye exam.\n\n2.  Pain.  He has had this pain syndrome for quite some time.  He is on short-acting narcotic and I think this is appropriate.  I am going to start him on a fentanyl patch 25 mcg p.o. q.d. and decrease his Percocet to 4 per day.  Hopefully, we will be able to wean him off his Percocet altogether.\n\n3.  Esophageal cancer.  Follow up with Dr. Yan and Dr. Patton.\n\n4.  Pulmonary nodule.  I emphasized the need for him to repeat his CT scan.  I sent an email to Dr. Yan.  He wants to only do them at the Cancer Center and that is where last films were done.  I explained how important it was.\n\n4.  Idiopathic thrombocytopenia.  We are going to watch this.  He had a workup by Dr. Sawyer in the past.  He reports no bleeding.\n\n5.  Coronary artery disease.  I asked him to get Dr. Landers's records for me, especially his last angiogram.  We are going to check his cholesterol today.  He will follow up with me in approximately 1 month's time to reevaluate his pain.\n\n6.  His EKG today shows a sinus rhythm at the rate of 60, normal intervals, normal axis, and poor R-wave progression in the precordial leads and as indicated above, possible septal infarct and possible inferior infarct.  I do not have a baseline for comparison.4. 5.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n______________________________\n\nScott Koontz, MD\n\n\n\n\n\nDictated By: Scott Koontz\n\n\n\n\n\neScription document:9-6525022 EMSSten Tel\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDD: 12/24/95\n\nDT: 12/25/95\n\nDV: 12/24/95\nRecord date: 2096-12-29\n\nEDVISIT^28297534^OGRADY, MICHAEL^12/29/96^AVILA, KRISTOPHER\n\nCHIEF COMPLAINT:  Chest pressure.\n\nMr. Ogrady is seen by the resident and also seen and examined by\n\nme.

He\n\ndescribed his pain as being very intense about 9/10, described\n\nheaviness across his chest and shortness of breath.  He stated\n\nthat while he was walking into his place his chest pain got worse\n\nand since then it was intermittent and stuttering in nature.  He\n\nwas taken to Muncy Valley Hospital where he was seen, treated,\n\nand transferred here.  He is currently pain free.  At Oakridge State his troponin was negative.  His CPK was\n\nnegative.  His EKG showed a Q-wave in III and aVF and had no\n\nacute ST elevation or ST depression on his cardiogram which\n\ncorrelates with our cardiogram here.\n\nPAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  His history, however, is significant in\n\nthat he has a cardiac catheterization that was done in 06/2093. \n\nAt that time, he had proximal LAD lesion of 30%, left main was\n\n30%, and left circumflex was also 30%.  He had an RCA lesion\n\nwhich was 100%, RCA proximal lesion, with good collateral flow. \n\nHis last echocardiogram was in 03/2093.  At that time, his LV\n\nfunction was normal and he had an EF of 55% to 60%.  His past\n\nmedical history is significant for diabetes and hypertension as\n\nwell as high cholesterol, had an myocardial infarction in 2084,\n\nhistory of metastatic esophageal cancer and history of DVT in his\n\nleft lower extremity in 2090.\n\nPAST SURGICAL HISTORY:  He has had an esophagectomy.  He\n\nunderwent fem-pop bypass surgery in 2088.  He has also had a\n\ncholecystectomy and appendectomy.\n\nSOCIAL HISTORY:  He is a 40-pack-year smoker.\n\nFAMILY HISTORY:  Also, has a strong family history of cardiac\n\ndisease.\n\nMEDICATIONS:  He is now pain free but described his pain this\n\nmorning as squeezing, pressure like, and heaviness in his chest.\n\nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  His vital signs here are normal.  His\n\nHEENT exam is benign.  His neck is supple with clear lungs\n\nbilaterally.  He has a 3/6 systolic murmur.  He has no rubs or\n\ngallops.  His pulses are normal, well perfused throughout and\n\nwarm extremities.  Abdomen is soft without any masses, good bowel\n\nsounds.  Extremities are normal.\n\nLABORATORY DATA:  EKG as described above again, a Q in III and\n\naVF, otherwise no acute changes on his cardiogram.  His CK is 33\n\nand his troponin is negative.  His creatinine is 1.9 with a BUN\n\nof 27.  All other labs are normal including his blood sugar which\n\nis 156.\n\nEMERGENCY DEPARTMENT COURSE:  The patient's cardiologist is Dr.\n\n ******** Not reviewed by Attending Physician ********\n\nrule out and maybe even need another cardiac catheterization if\n\nnecessary.\n\nDIAGNOSIS:  Chest pain and chest pressure with history of an MI\n\nand history of coronary artery disease.\n\n______________________________\n\nAVILA, KRISTOPHER M.D.\n\nD: 12/29/96\n\nT: 12/29/96\n\nDictated By: AVILA, KRISTOPHER\n\neScription document:3-0867902 BFFocus\nRecord date: 2098-01-26\n\n\n\nReason for Visit\n\nDate/Time of Visit:\n\n Mr. Ogrady was transferred to GSH on 1/26 from Muncy Valley Hospital, where he had presented with shortness of breath and chest pain.

Please see\n\nhis note for further details.  I confirm that I have interviewed\n\nand examined the patient, reviewed the resident's documentation\n\non the patient's chart, and discussed the evaluation, plan of\n\ncare, and disposition with the patient.\n\nHISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 69-year-old male\n\nwith a history of hypertension, diabetes, coronary artery\n\ndisease, previous MI, and esophageal cancer with mets to lung,\n\nstatus post VATS, and a recent hemothorax and chest tube.  He was\n\ndischarged 2 days ago, now presenting with increasing cough.  He\n\nhad been seen in an outside hospital earlier today and diagnosed\n\nwith a right lower lobe pneumonia.  He was also given 1 g of\n\nceftriaxone.  His complaints prior to presentation had been chest\n\npain as well as shortness of breath, abdominal discomfort, and\n\npalpitations.  On reviewing his chart, he had had his diltiazem\n\nand Lopressor discontinued on his last admission.  Other systems\n\nwere reviewed and found to be negative including fevers, chills,\n\nhemoptysis, or difficulty swallowing.\n\nMEDICATIONS:  Reviewed.  Please see the chart.  He is currently\n\non aspirin and took today.\n\nALLERGIES:  IV dye and Neurontin.\n\nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  He is awake, alert, but cachectic\n\nappearing, and nontoxic.  Temperature 98, pulse of 111,\n\nrespirations 20, blood pressure 104/61, and oxygen saturations\n\nare 95%, however, this is on 5 liters.  HEENT exam:  Mucosal\n\nmembranes are dry.  Neck is supple without lymphadenopathy. \n\nLungs:  Crackles at the right lung.  Left lung is clear.  CVS: \n\nTachycardic but regular.  Abdomen:  There is some mild diffuse\n\ntenderness in the upper quadrants, no rebound or guarding, and no\n\nMurphy's.  He has normoactive bowel sounds.  Skin is warm and\n\ndry.  Back is nontender at CVA points.  He has got bilateral\n\nlower extremity edema, but no tenderness in the thighs and\n\ncalves.  Neurologically, he is somewhat somnolent, but oriented\n\nwithout focal motor or sensory deficits.\n\nLABORATORY DATA:  White count is elevated at 19,300, 90% polys, 2\n\nbands.  Chemistries are normally slightly perhaps more dehydrated\n\nwith creatinine of 1.3, which is a little above his baseline of\n\n1.2 when he was discharged.  LFTs are all normal including lipase\n\nand total bilirubin; however, his alkaline phosphatase is mildly\n\nelevated.  First set of cardiac enzymes is negative.  EKG shows a\n\nsinus tachycardia with PVCs and nonspecific inferior ST-T wave\n\nchanges.  Chest x-ray shows bilateral basilar nodules, which have\n\nbeen there in the past.  There is a hazy opacity in the right mid\n\nhemithorax, which does not look new, however, this could\n\nrepresent tumor versus pneumonia.  However, no significant change\n\nprior to his discharge.\n\nEMERGENCY DEPARTMENT COURSE:  Given his dyspnea and his elevated\n\nwhite count, this case was discussed with Oncology.  He was\n\nadmitted for dyspnea, ruling out pneumonia.  He is in stable\n\ncondition.\n\n______________________________\n\nOCASIO, GEORGE OJAS MD\n\nD: 03/29/98\n\nT: 03/29/98\n\nDictated By: OCASIO, GEORGE OJAS\n\neScription document:8-5838264 BFFocus\n\n ******** Not reviewed by Attending Physician ********"}

The aortic valve is tricuspid. There is no evidence of aortic insufficiency by color or spectral Doppler. \nLEFT VENTRICLE \nThe left ventricular cavity size is normal. The left ventricular systolic function is within normal limits. There are no obvious segmental wall motion abnormalities. There is a false tendon within the LV cavity which is a normal variant. The estimated ejection fraction is 65 %. \nTRICUSPID VALVE - IVC, SVC \nThere is color and spectral Doppler evidence of mild tricuspid insufficiency. \nPULMONARY VALVE, INFUND., P.A. \nThere is evidence of trace pulmonary insufficiency by color and spectral Doppler. The RV systolic pressure was estimated from the regurgitant tricuspid velocity (assuming an RA pressure of 10mmHg). The estimated RV systolic pressure is 33 mmHg. \nRIGHT VENTRICLE \nThe right ventricle is not dilated. The right ventricular systolic function is within normal limits. \nINTERATRIAL SEPTUM, INTERVENTRICULAR SEPTUM \nThere are increased echoes along the interatrial septum c/w a closure device. The appearance of the device is most c/w an Amplatzer device. There is evidence of a patent foramen ovale by agitated saline contrast after Valsalva maneuver. \nPERICARDIAL DISEASE AND EXTRACARDIAC MASSES \nThere is no evidence of pericardial effusion. \nCONCLUSIONS \nCompared to the report of 12/06/2063, there is residual shunt with the valsalva manuever. \n\n\n\n\n\tAssessment and plan:\n   In summary, Xian is a 56-year-old female s/p myocardial infarction, likely the result of paradoxical emboli via a large PFO, and s/p closure of her PFO on 12/05/63 using a 25 mm Crybiform Amplatzer device.  She is doing well from the cardiac perspective, and denies any further neurological events.  Upon our review of the echocardiogram there is a trace shunt across the device (7 beats, only after Valsalva) consistent w/ intra-pulmonary shunting.  We are willing to try decreasing her Toprol XL to 12.5mg qd, in an attempt to alleviate her HA's.  If this proves unsucessful, we will trial a course of Atenolol.  We agree with continuation of her ASA therapy and will see her in f/u for her 6 month appointment in June w/ an Echo w/ bubbles.  \n\n\n\n\nChanges to Medications this visit\n\t\nCoumadin     as directed End: 2/19/2064 held for cath lab - Inactivated\nAdvair HFA 250   bid\nToprol XL 12.5 mg   daily\naspirin 325 mg   daily\n\n\t\nFloyd Fong, MD pager #81895\n\n\t\nTranscribed by: Clara D Quilici\n\n\t\ncc: Paulette Yancy (PCP)\n\n\t\nSigned electronically by  Floyd Fong, MD\nDocument Status: Final\nRecord date: 2065-12-29\n\n\n\tCARDIOLOGY\n\t\n\n\tGRETNA CHIROPRACTIC CENTER\n\t\n\nRE:  S/p PFO closure using a 25 mm Cribiform Amplatzer device on 12/05/63\n\nDear Dr. Yancy: \n\n  It is a pleasure seeing Mrs. Xuereb in follow up s/p her PFO closure on 12/05/63 using a 25 mm Cribriform Amplatzer device. \nHer history is also significant for inferior STEMI the morning after arthroscopic shoulder surgery for adhesive capsulitis in 10/63, Protein S deficiency, COPD, HTN and dyslipidemia. \nShe is doing well from the cardiac perspective. She continues to note a rare, short-lived palpitation but states that these have definitely lessened in nature over the years. She does report, however, that she began to note non-exertional, short-lived episodes of chest pain which started about 1 month ago. She says that by the time she \"thinks about taking a SL NTG\", the pain has resolved. Her catheterization revealed non-significant CAD. Significant spasm in the ostium of the RCA. The distal RCA at the prior intervention site looks normal. \nShe denies any further neurological events or headaches. \nOf note, she reveals that a few weeks prior to onset of chest pain she began smoking again. She was smoking 5 cigs/day, and has stopped since Saturday when she resumed her Chantix treatment plan. \nOur last recorded lipid profile drawn on 5/2/2064: CHOL: 135, HDL: 50. No TG or LDL noted. She has had this repeated since and is being followed by Dr. Yelton.

She remains stable from the cardiac perspective, and denies any further neurological events. Given her new onset of chest pain, and recent return to smoking, we have asked her to stop smoking and call us in 2 weeks to report any change in her chest pain. If at that time, the pain has persisted we will obtain an ETT without imaging; if her pain has resolved with smoking cessation we will ask her to follow up with her PCP to continue with smoking cessation plan. We have asked that she have Dr. Paulette Yancy fax us a copy of her most recent lipid profile for our records and have reiterated the LDL goal of less than 100 for secondary prevention of strokes. We have asked her to obtain a TTE without bubbles for our annual review, and will call her once these results are available to us.

Hence, our three goals that we set \ntoday were:\n1.   Management of the patient's own medications, which she was doing \n     six months ago.\n2.   To get out of the house at least once a week, using either \n     community transportation or a family member.\n3.   To be doing the family's laundry each week.\n \nWhile the patient was not happy about being told that she could not \ndrive, she understood the reasons and was satisfied with the goals that \nwe set.\n \nHence, I will see her back in about six weeks and see how she is doing \nwith these goals.  As well, we will continue to have the visiting nurse \nsee her every other week to monitor her blood sugar and Coumadin.\n \n \n \n______________________________\nSteve George, M.D.                                                    \n \nft:ZO:1640                                                               \nDD:1-20-66                                                              \nDT:1-21-66                                                              \nDV:1-20-66                                                              \n ******** Not reviewed by Attending Physician ********\nRecord date: 2066-03-03\n\nGRANITE COUNTY MEMORIAL\nArthritis Department\n93 Weld St                             BIRD, TERRI\nLisbon, SD  52797                             80910690\n                                              3-03-66\n \n \n \nID: Mrs. Bird comes in today for a routine check-up.  She is a \n70-year-old female with multiple medical problems including atrial \nfibrillation, status post renal allograft, status post MVR and AVR, on \nCoumadin now, history of CABG in the setting of her valve replacements, \nhistory of a recent aortic aneurysm repair with some mental status \ndiminution after the surgery. \n \nMEDICATIONS: Synthroid, Hydralazine, Lopressor, prednisone, Coumadin, \nProvera, NPH insulin, Neurontin 300mg t.i.d., Imuran 100mg a day, Zocor \n20mg a day, and Digoxin 0.25 alternating with 0.125mg.  She is also \ntaking Fosamax 10mg a day and Premarin 0.3mg a day.  \n \nThe patient is followed closely by a visiting nurse at home.  Her blood \npressure checks have all been 120-140/70-90 and her blood sugars have \nbeen running in the morning between 80 and 120 and in the evening from \n150 all the way up to 450.  We have made some adjustments recently in \nher NPH morning dose, and hope to see if this will make a benefit.  \n \nPatient notes that she has been feeling generally well, that she has \nbeen able to fill her cassettes for her medicines, and overall manage her \nmedicines without problems.  She does note that she is having some pain \ndown her left leg, which she describes as her usual sciatica.  The \npatient has had this on multiple occasions, and it usually waxes and \nwanes over time.  The Neurontin in the past has been very helpful for \nthis. \n \nThe patient denies any chest pain, shortness of breath, has had no \nfevers or weight loss recently, and has no dyspnea at nighttime. \n \nPHYSICAL EXAM: Notable for a short female in no acute distress, who \nwalks with a walker today.  Blood pressure: 144/76.  Pulse: 78 and \nregular.  Her lungs bilaterally are clear to auscultation.   Her heart \nis with sharp click during S1 and S2.  She has got a regular rate and \nrhythm today.  Her abdomen is soft, nontender, with no organomegaly.  \nShe has got a well-healed abdominal scar. She has got no lower extremity \nedema.  Her musculoskeletal examination is notable for tenderness up \ninto the sciatic notch on the left side.  She has got otherwise joints \nthat move through a normal range of motion, no swelling or warmth. There \nis no evidence for ecchymoses or petechiae anywhere.  \n \nToday will check a hemoglobin A1C, a CBC, and a chem 7 for routine \nmonitoring. \n \nMy overall impression is that Ms. Bird is doing quite well.   I will \nnot make any changes to her medicines until I see her hemoglobin A1C.  I \nsuggested that I could give her an injection for her sciatica, but I \nwould rather wait because of her anticoagulation, and to see whether it \nremits on it's own. \n \nGRANITE COUNTY MEMORIAL\nArthritis Department\n12 Weld St                             BIRD, TERRI\nLisbon, SD  52797                             80910690\n                                              3-03-66\nPAGE 2\n \n \nLastly, as far as her ability to drive, this has been an issue for the \nlast several months since her abdominal aortic aneurysm repair. She is \nclearly doing better from a mental status standpoint, as evidenced by \nher being able to manage her own medications.  I have discussed this \nissue at length with family and her nurse, and everybody is comfortable \nwith her trying to drive with someone in the car with her.  I will talk \nto her son, Steven Bird, who lives downstairs, and see whether he or \nhis wife could help with trying her out driving first in a schoolyard \nwithout any people there, and then on less-crowded roads, and then \nfinally in a more regular situation.  We will try this over time and see \nhow it works, and I will be involved in making any decisions as far as \nletting her drive on her own. \n \n \n \n______________________________\nSteve George, M.D.                                                    \n \nEH:UC:8398                                                               \nDD:3-03-66                                                              \nDT:3-04-66                                                              \nDV:3-03-66                                                              \n ******** Not reviewed by Attending Physician ********\nRecord date: 2067-01-12\n\n \n \n \n                                                          (550) 659-5187\nGRANITE COUNTY MEMORIAL HOSPITAL\n \n \n \nJanuary 13, 2067\n \nGwendolyn Irvine, M.D. \nHoughton Community Health Center\n Lyons Street\nQueen Creek, SD 89544\n \n \nRE:  Bird, Terri                                                    \nMRN: 80910690                                                           \n  \nDear Dr. Irvine:\n \nI had the chance today to see Terri Bird in follow-up, as her \nprimary care physician. As you are well aware, she is 71-year-old female \nwho resides currently at the Elm Hills Nursing Home where you \nhave been taking care of her. I have not seen her now for the past ten \nmonths. For my records, I am going to summarize her medical history \nbriefly. It includes a history of atrial fibrillation. She is status \npost an MVR with Duluth Clinic. She is on chronic anti-coagulation. She is \nstatus post a renal allograft for what is believed to be a history of \nstrep glomerular nephritis. She has been on Imuran and Prednisone for \nseveral decades with no history of rejection. She also has a history of \na CABG in the setting of her valve replacement. As well, she has a \nhistory of spinal stenosis, for which she has been treated \nintermittently with epidural steroid injection. About a year ago, she \nhad an abdominal aortic aneurysm repair and in this setting developed \nsome delirium and at that point was sent to rehab where she had a ankle \nfracture and a long recovery and she spent time at several different \nnursing homes and had a hip fracture as well as a recurrent ankle \nfracture and most recently has been with you at Elm Hills Nursing Home. I also have a discharge summary from a recent hospitalization \nwhere she had a pneumonia, a right middle lobe which was successfully \ntreated with levofloxacin. \n \nMEDICATIONS: Her current medications from the notes that I received \ninclude Premarin .3mg, Neurontin 300mg each day, Miacalcin nasal spray, \nProvera 2.5mg, Synthroid 25mcg, Digoxin 125mcg, Cardizem CD 180mg a day, \nImuran 100mg a day, Lopressor 50mg twice a day, calcium carbonate 500mg \nthree times a day, Isordil 3 times a day as well as Coumadin based on \nher INR.\n \nALLERGIES: She has an allergy to penicillin as well as sulfur and \ncephalosporins and of note she had been on a tapering Prednisone dose \nwhich seems to have been stopped. As well, she is on sliding scale \ninsulin and Humulin N, which seems to have been adjusted recently. \nRE:  Bird, Terri                                                    \nMRN: 80910690                                                           \nJanuary 13, 2067\nPage 2\n \n \nThe patient was brought to me today by her family, because they were \nconcerned that she was not getting optimal care. In talking to her, she \nsays she feels quite well. She has no pain. She has no pain in her \nbuttocks or her legs. She says her breathing feels well. She has no \nproductive cough. She has no chest pain. She denies any peripheral \nedema. She notes that she is concerned that she is not getting enough \nexercise at Elm Hill Nursing Home, but otherwise feels like she \nis getting reasonable care. However, she does breakdown and cry about \nher current situation in that she is depressed about living in a nursing \nhome. \n \nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION: On the exam today, her blood pressure is 122/70. \nShe has a regular rate and rhythm on heart exam with a pulse of 72. She \nhas sharp clicks over her chest. She has a soft abdomen with no \norganomegaly and a well healed scar. She has equal pulses bilaterally. \nShe has got a normal skin exam with multiple skin tags. She has a full \nrange of motion in her upper extremities as well as her hips, knees and \nankles. She has a stooped gate and I watch her walk with her walker and \nshe seems relatively stable. She is somewhat confused about the date and \nthe place, but recognizes me and is able to articulate very clearly \nabout her current situation at Elm Hills. \n \nI have no laboratory data to speak of. \n \nI had a long conversation with her and her husband as well as her son \nand daughter-in-law and explained my concerns with her overall safety \nand I thought that currently it would be unwise for her to be in an \nunsupervised setting. I thought that a nursing home is a reasonable \nplace for her to be and suggested quite strongly to consider an \nantidepressant. It looks like you have had a psychiatrist evaluate her \nrecently and I think it would be worthwhile, at least a month trial of \nSSRI, gradually titrating up the dose based on her side effects. \n \nI am more than happy to see her intermittently to give her reassurance, \nbut it seems like your care has been excellent and feel free to contact \nme with questions about her past history. \n \nSincerely, \n \n \n \nSteve George, M.D.                                                    \n \nlb:TT:1489                                                              \nDD:1-13-67                                                               \nDT:1-13-67                                                               \n ******** Not reviewed by Attending Physician ********\nRecord date: 2069-02-17\n\nMD Connect Call 11:59pm 2/16/69 from Dr. Hale at Senior Care Clinic Queen Creek, SD regarding Terri Bird.  Patient admitted there 2/12/69 with CHF exacerbation with some associated COPD exacerbation and associated pneumonia.  All initially improved but then clinically worsening 2/14-2/16.  Patient requiring 100% NRB mask to maintain normal saturation with rising BUN/CR (hx kidney transplant).  Clinically showing pulmonary edema but no urine output to IV lasix.  Patient had established DNR status.  \n\n\n\nRequest by family to Dr. Hale to transfer patient to GCM.  I spoke to MD, nurse, and daughter-in-law and offered to accept patient when she was medically stabilized.  I thought she was too ill to safely transfer at the time without intubation before-hand.  \n\n\n\nI called RN back at 6am and learned that patient had O2 saturation of 70%, pH=7.2 and covering MD had honored patient's established DNR order despite some family members desire to reverse it.  Patient too ill to transfer safely; will contact me again if patient stabilized.\n\n\n\nAl S. Everhart, MD\n\nHospitalist Service"}

His last visit was in December 2075, following which he had a routine stress test. He had been planning to do some skiing over January, and we wanted to give him clearance to do so.\n\n\n\nHis stress test was done on 1-4-76, and revealed mild apical ischemia. He completed 8 METs and had no symptoms during the test.  Based on these findings, we did not change any medications and encouraged him to continue with his usual activities.  Unfortunatley, he was never able to ski over January anyway due to a bout with pneumonia.\n\n\n\nHe had also reported a vague sensation of shortness of breath that was occurring \"rarely\", but was correlated with the consumption of alcohol.  The frequency of these episodes has increased to 2-3 times per week. He says it is not really shortness of breath, but an awareness that something feels different. He is able to continue his usual activities, including his aerobics and pilates classes without difficulty.\n\n\n\nHe denies any chest discomfort, palpitations, rapid heart action, dizziness or syncope.\n\n\n\nPast medical history:\n\n   DMII, CAD, s/p CABG, VF Arrest Hypercholesterolemia, 1st Degree AV block, RBBB, NSVT\n\n\n\nMedications (Confirmed):\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\n\nDalmane 30 mg\n\nglyburide 2.5mg po qd\n\nLipitor 20 mg\n\nlisinopril 5 mg po qd\n\nmetformin hydrochloride 500 mg\n\nNexium 40mg po qd\n\n\n\nPhysical examination:\n\n-BP: 110/70  \n\n-Pulse: 50  \n\n-General:   No acute distress.\n\n-Skin:   No rashes, anicteric.\n\n-Heent:   Unremarkable\n\n-Neck:   Carotids 2+ without bruits. JVP no jugular venous distention.\n\n-Chest:   Clear to auscultation.\n\n-Cardiac:   Left ventricular impulse discrete and nondisplaced. Regular rate and rhythm, normal S1 and S2, with no S3 or S4. There were no murmurs, clicks or rubs.\n\n-Abdomen:   Normal bowel sounds, soft and nontender, with no hepatosplenomegaly or masses appreciated.\n\n-Extremities:   No cyanosis, clubbing or edema. 2+ pedal pulses.\n\n\n\nEKG:\n\n   Sinus Bradycardia 50bpm, 1st degree AV block PR 290ms, RBBB. Compared to previous EKGs, PR interval is slightly longer.\n\n\n\nAssessment and plan:\n\n   Mr. Quijanno is doing well with the exception of these brief episodes of shortness of breath. I am encouraged that these events do not inhibit him from exercise. We have fitted him with a holter monitor today to further sort out any arrhythmogenic etiology of his symptoms.  We will discuss the findings over the phone on Wednesday of this week.\n\n\n\nThe above plan was discussed with Dr. Kilian Middleton, who is in agreement.\n\n\n\n\n\nXimena Mays, N.P. and Kilian Middleton, M.D.\n\n\n\nChanges to Medications this visit\n\nLipitor 20 mg    QTY:60 Refills:6 Start: 7/22/2072 1 tab po qd\n\nlisinopril 5 mg  po qd QTY:90 Refills:3 Start: 1/27/2075\n\nNexium 40mg  po qd QTY:30 Refills:2 Start: 10/11/2075\n\nglyburide 2.5mg  po qd QTY:90 Refills:3 Start: 10/11/2072\n\nmetformin hydrochloride 500 mg    QTY:360 Refills:1 year Start: 4/12/2071 2 tabs po bid\n\nDalmane 30 mg    QTY:30 Refills:2 Start: 5/2/66 take 1 at hs prn\n\n\n\nSigned electronically by   Ximena A Mays NP  on  Jun 5, 2076\nRecord date: 2076-08-29\n\nAugust 29, 2076\n\n\n\nDr. Galvan\n\nInternal Medicine Associates\n\nRM 309\n\n\n\nRe:  \tQuijano, Donny \n\n\tSMC Unit # 544-84-52\n\n\n\nDear Dr. Galvan:\n\n\n\nI had the pleasure of seeing your patient, Mr. Quijano, in followup for episodes of dyspnea, in the setting of asthma, gastroesophageal reflux, myasthenia gravis and distant coronary disease.\n\n\n\nHe reports that his    spasms    of unpredictable exertional breathlessness have continued to be substantially in remission, occurring less than once a week and sometimes only every two weeks.  Swallowing is fine with fewer choking episodes when he drinks water, but no problem with the ingestion of other substances.  \n\n\n\nNo cough, phlegm, lower extremity edema, chest pain or chest infections.\n\n\n\nNo reflux symptoms.\n\n\n\nSneezing spells and coryza, especially in the morning, have been most noticeable in the past several months.\n\n\n\nHe enjoyed his trip to Romania, and had only two days when he had a couple of minor spells.\n\n\n\nMedications:  Advair, 100/50, one puff b.i.d. (continues the 10 second breath hold); lisinopril; atenolol; Mestinon; Metformin; no proton pump inhibitor.\n\n\n\nOn examination, he is his usual fit-appearing self.  Blood pressure is 130/70, respiratory rate 18 and unlabored, heart rate 55 and regular.  Conjunctivae are clear.  Sinuses nontender.  Nasal passages are narrowed but without inflammation.  Oropharynx:  Mild crowding in the posterior pharynx, but there were no definite exudates.  No goiter or adenopathy.  Back:  Normal configuration.  Chest:  Normal percussion note, faint prolongation of the expiratory phase without definite wheezes.  Cardiac:  Vague cardiac impulse, 1/6 systolic mid to late systolic murmur at the apex, JVP 8 cm with borderline HJR, no S3.  Abdomen:  Soft, scaphoid, nontender, no hepatosplenomegaly or mass.  Extremities:  No cyanosis, clubbing or edema.  Skin:  Well tanned.\n\n\n\nPulmonary function tests today show regression of the FEV1 from 2.09 liters on 6/27 to 1.72 liters, similar to the 1.62 liter value of 6/13, with an FVC that has decreased from 3.47 on 6/27 to 2.8 liters now, although with an FET of only 8.5 versus 14.3.\n\n\n\nCT scan today, by my review - A tiny nodule in the extreme right apex, mildly thickened bronchi in the extreme left lower lobe, status post mediasternotomy with diffuse calcification of the coronary arteries.\n\n\n\nImpression:\n\n\n\nEpisodic dyspnea due to asthma, with underlying excellent functional status and because of his stoicism and fitness, with the variability in pulmonary function on testing correlating well with a slight increase in the frequency of his occasional episodes, because of the asthma and allergies, he may benefit from Singulair.\n\n\n\nProbable mild occult gastroesophageal reflux.\n\n\n\nIschemic coronary disease, status post VF arrest and revascularization.\n\n\n\nMyasthenia, mainly ocular.\n\n\n\nPrior Raynaud's syndrome.\n\n\n\nRecommendations:\n\n\n\nContinue Advair at the current dose.\n\n\n\nTrial of Singulair, 10 mg p.o. q. p.m.\n\n\n\nLow threshold for adding a proton-pump inhibitor and/or intranasal steroids.\n\n\n\nContinue exercise program.\n\n\n\nReturn visit in three months with pulmonary function tests at that time.\n\n\n\nIt has been a pleasure to participate in his care.\n\n\n\nSincerely yours,\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDean S.

Added low-dose glyburide 1.25 mg QD in October, for hemoglobin A1c 7.80.  Followup hemoglobin A1c last month better, 7.10.  Asked him to concentrate more on diet.  Says he is up-to-date with Ophthalmology.\n\n\n\nHyperlipidemia\n\nLipitor 10 mg QD.  Tolerating well.  Check followup lipids, CK, and transaminases.  Target LDL 70.\n\n\n\nCoronary artery disease\n\nFollowed by Dr.  Middleton.  Suffered a cardiac arrest while skiing January 2072.  Resuscitated, cardioverted, sent to Lowell General Hospital, transferred to SMC.  Cath showed 70% distal left main; 90% proximal LAD; 90% first diagonal; 60% left circumflex; 40% first marginal; RCA normal.  Underwent three-vessel bypass grafting (SVG to LAD, diagonal, OM).  Has done well since then.  Most recent ETT January 2076 showed an equivocal mild apical reversible defect, but nothing else.  Asymptomatic.     02/23/2077:   Remains asymptomatic.  Continue medical management which at this point consists of antiplatelet therapy, beta blocker, and ACE inhibitor.\n\n\n\nAsthma\n\nSevere in childhood.

Review of prior test results discloses chronic low-grade elevation serum CK. Spoke with the patient; no myalgias, arthralgias, or fevers. Possibly related to Lipitor.  Discontinue, substitute pravastatin.  Return in four weeks to recheck CK and transaminases.  The patient understands.  Call in the meantime for problems or questions.     05/25/2077:   Now on pravastatin without side effects.  CK unchanged.

Mckenzie, M.D.\nSan Luis Obispo County General Hospital\n123 Pittsburg Street, Euite 598\nBaxter Springs, MO  64715\n\nHISTORY:  Mr. Ehlers is referred for evaluation of extensive coronary disease status.  He has history of several risk factors and a history of hypertension, hypercholesterolemia and a history of cigarette smoking. He has a prior history of peripheral arterial disease with a known abdominal aortic aneurysm.  He also has a history of bicuspid aortic valve with mild-to-moderate stenosis on recent echos and paroxysmal atrial fibrillation.  \n\nHe is status post a posterolateral MI in 2084 and had an adenosine MIBI in January 2097 with an old inferior MI and peri-infarct ischemia.  He presented with increasing angina with exertion where he is able to do most activities and climb stairs and walk his dog, but does have about one episode of angina a week while raking leaves that last about 5 minutes and resolves with rest.  He has not had any rest pain.  For his increasing angina, he had an attempted cardiac catheterization done last month, but they are unable to advance the guidewire pass the iliac artery and an MRI was able to determine that he has an occluded aorta.  He then had a left brachial artery.  Cardiac catheterization that revealed extensive coronary disease with a 70-80% distal left main stenosis and severe disease of the LAD and circumflex with minimal flow and a subtotal occlusion of the proximal right coronary with collateralization from the LAD territory.  There was an anomalous circumflex that appeared to emerge from the right coronary and there was a question of his anomalus LAD with a separate ostium superior to the left main, but the documentation of this was not clear.  With the complexity of his anatomy, he is referred for further evaluation.  He has otherwise a history of cigarette smoking and quit three months ago, does not drink alcohol.  He is married and lives in Missouri.\n\nMEDICATIONS:  His baseline medicines include aspirin 81 mg a day, has included warfarin, ramipril 10 mg a day, Lopressor 50 mg twice a day, Lipitor 80 mg a day and Zetia 10 mg a day.\n\nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  A well-appearing man in no acute distress.  Blood pressure of 128/60, pulse of 60-70 and room air sat of 99%.  He had no jugular venous distention.  Chest was clear.  Heart had normal S1 and S2.  No S3 or S4.  There is a 2/6 systolic ejection murmur along the left sternal border.  His abdomen was benign.  Extremities showed no peripheral edema, but very faint distal pulses that were audible by Doppler.\n\nIMAGING STUDIES:  His electrocardiogram showed sinus rhythm with left anterior fascicular block and was otherwise unremarkable.  His labs showed a BUN/creatinine of 21/1.3, glucose 145 and hematocrit of 40%.\n\nIMPRESSION:  Mr. Ehlers presents with extensive vascular disease including left main and three-vessel disease.  We will try and define better his actual anatomy and likely do act angiogram to try and identify the locations of any anomalus vessels and then have a surgical consults regarding bypass surgery for his left main extensive disease.  We will also get an echocardiogram to reevaluate carefully the aortic valve.  We will also likely consult the vascular surgeons to discuss management of the occluded aorta.\n\n\n______________________________\nEdward L Echevarria, M.D.\n\n\n\n\n\neScription document:1-0864568 SFFocus\n\n\n\nDD: 10/20/97\nDT: 10/20/97\nDV: 10/20/97\nRecord date: 2097-11-06\n\n\n\nHistory of Present Illness\n\nAsked by Dr. Ehlers to consult on glycemic management for Mr. Ulysses Ehlers who has no history of DM but was noted to be hyperglycemic postop. Mr. Ehlers is POD 1, s/p C4. His family history is positive for diabetes (mother diagnosed in her 80s).  He has required a regular insulin gtt protocol intermittently postop. He is now on a full liquid diet.\n\n\n\nMax BG: 197\n\nCurrent BG: 145\n\nInsulin gtt off at present\n\n \n\nMr. Ehlers is a 69 yo M h/o CAD s/p MI 2084 (posterolateral), HTN, hyperlipidemia, a-fib, AAA, PVD, smoking (50 pk yr) who presents for CABG. Initially presented to Bonner General Hospital 9/97 for w/u of exertional chest pain. Cardiac cath was unsuccessful via femoral approach due to presumed aortoiliac occlusion. Subsequent cath 10/18/97 revealed left main stenosis with distal occlusion, RCA proximal occlusion and diffuse LAD stenosis. Pt was transferred to BHCC on 10/19 for further evaluation by the cardiology service. On 10/21 he underwent echo which revealed EF 55% with mild AS. On 10/22, cardiac cath revealed 3 V disease. Cardiac surgery was consulted and recommended CABG after medical optimization. His anginal symptoms remained stable and he was subsequently discharged home on 10/23. He now returns for surgical revascularization. Since his discharge on 10/23, he has not experienced any new or worsening chest pain or SOB. Denies orthopnea, PND. \n\n \n\nPreoperative Cardiac Status: Myocardial infarction 2084, requiring hospitalization. Myocardial infarction 2084, requiring hospitalization.

He is an arteriopath with occluded aorta beneath the levels of renal arteries as revealed in recent MRA. In the past an attempted femoral artery cannulation was proved unsuccessful due to above reason. Subsequently he underwent two cardiac angiograms thro' left brachial and Rt radial arterial route.\n\n His creatinine has risen from baseline of 1.6 (Nov 97, post CABG) to 4.07 (may 98). He denies taking any NSAIDS. He thinks that he was started on Altace post surgery, but was not sure about that fact.\n\nDr. Turk did an duplex scan to assess his renal arteries which was suggestive of high grade stenosis of renal arteries on both sides. Since IR doctors at CentralBuffalo were not keen to do renal agniogram/angioplasty thro' radial artery route, Dr.Turk refered Mr. Ehlers to BHCC for consideration of renal angioplasty. He has also asked him to discontinue Altace and to withold coumadin (Indn: AF) inview of potential angioplasty.\n\nHe complains of claudication pains in both legs with left leg>Rt leg. He experiences pain on exertion on left calf, thigh and buttock. He complains of long term pedal swelling which extends upto upper knee level. He is SOB on moderate exertion and sleeps with 3 pillows. He also has some prostatic symptoms with poor urinary stream, frequency etc.\n\n\nPast Medical History:\nCAD s/p CABG on 10/97\nParoxysmal AF\nDM2\nHTN\nHyperlipidemia\nPVD (occluded aorta)\nAS (aortic bicapsid) \nBPH\n\nMedications: NKDA\nAmiodarone 200mg daily\nAtenolol 100mg BID\nMetformin HCL 500mg daily\nASA 81mg daily \nLasix 40mg daily,\nlipitor 40mg daily prn\nZetia 10mg daily prn\n\nFamily History: no history of renal disease in family\n\nSocial History: married.

His MRA of abdomen was reviewed with Dr.Quilici, BHCC IR department. Aorta is fully occluded beneath the level of both kidneys. Tight renal artery stenosis noted in both kidneys. Both proximal and distal stenosis noted in the Rt renal artery. Both kidneys appeared normal in size 11.2 and 11.4 cm. Dr.Quilici is confident that renal angioplasty could be done relatively safely through radial artery approach.\n\n2. We have requested Dr.Xi, Vascular surgeon to get his opinon on the need for surgical revascularisation of feet to save his legs from critical ischemia in the future. If so, whether he would benefit from surgical revascularisation of the kidneys. We are awaiting his expert opinion.\n\n3. Patient realises that renal angiogram + angioplasty thro' radial artery carries its own risk. Risks of Cholesterol emboli, Contrast nephropathy, arterial injury, risk of further deterioration of his kidney function leading to early initiation of dialysis are explained. However patient feels that it worth taking a choice to prevent the kidneys from worsening rapidly by attempted angiopalsty.\n\n4. We will obtain renal ultrasound to again measure his kidneys and to rule out any obstructive uropathy as the cause of renal dysfunction.\n\n5. If patient is going for IR renal angiogram/plasty, then he will need Contrast prophylaxis.\n\nWe will review him tomorrow with Dr.Xi's opinon.\n\n_________________________________\nDONNIE YOUNGMAN MB MRCP(ENG)\nP43903\n\n\n\nRenal Staff\n\nI have seen and examined the patient twice today, and have reviewed his MR studies with radiology\nIn essence I agree with Dr Youngman's recs.\n\nPatient has normal sized kidneys with insidious rise in Cr without obvious identifiable remediable causes.\nHe has severe aortic disease with occlusion of the aortia, mod severe bilateral claudication in LL.\nHis renal arteries have ostial stenoses bilaterally.\n\nHis options are:\n1) conservative approach, and likely ESRD in the coming weeks\n2) Radiological placements of bilateral stents via L brachial artery\n3) Surgical bypass as a part of larger repair for LL claudication\n\nWe are in discussions with Radiology and Surgery to come up with a final recommendation which we will d/w patient tomorrow.\n\nUriah Judge\nMD PhD\nRecord date: 2098-06-11\n\n \n\n\nCardiovascular Medicine Consult Service Consult Note\nX. R. Xi, MD, PhD\nVascular Medicine Fellow, #45811\n\nDate of Consultation: June 11, 2098\n\nID: 70 year old male from Missouri\nReason for Consult: Perioperative consultation prior to aorto-bifemoral bypass surgery\n\nHistory of Present Illness:\n\tThis 70 year old gentleman was diagnosed with an occluded distal aorta in mid-2097 after an attempt at cardiac catheterization via the femoral artery.  \n\tOver the last several months, he has had exercise limiting lower extremity pain     he describes primarily left leg burning (thigh, calf) when he walks, coming on over about 150 yards.  If he pushes further, he will also get right leg burning in a similar distribution. \n\tHe also has had a marked increase in CR over the past 8 monts (1.1 -> >4).  Based on non-invasive imaging, this has been attributed to renal artery stenosis.  His ACE-I (?ramipril) has  been held, without improvement.  A referral was recently made to rule out bilateral RAS, and he had an invasive aortogram yesterday.  There was an 85% proximal right RA stenosis, and a 40% left RA stenosis, perhaps only partially explaining the elevated Cr.  The angiogram also confirmed the occluded distal aorta (below the renal arteries, the SMA is patent).  An aortobifem plus right RA revascularization is planned.\n\tHe has had reduced functional capacity for some time.  He gets claudication within 150 yards, but he also has been limited by exertional dyspnea.  He complains also of orthopnea (3 pillows), PND, as well as bilateral LE edema.  He also has noticed his weight continuing to creep up which he attributes to fluid retention.  He is avoiding salt, but not fluid restricting.  His lasix dose has not changed.  He has been angina free since his CABG surgery.  He has not had palpitations or AF since the immediate post-op period.  A ROS is otherwise unremarkable.\n\nPast Medical History:\nCoronary artery disease\nMI 2084\nDeveloped limiting angina in late 2096, early 2097\nCABGx4 on November 05, 2097 (Dr. Ehlers)\nCABG x 4 (LIMA - LAD/ Sequential graft: SVG1 connects Aorta to D1 then OM1/ SVG2 - LVB2\nIncidental anomalous circumflex off the right coronary artery\nPre-op EF 50-55% with infero-posterior hypokineses (?post-op)\nBicuspid aortic valve (not replaced with CABG according to notes)\nMild AS, Mild AI only on pre-CABG echo 2097\nHypertension\nDyslipidemia\nDiabetes Type II\nPerioperative hyperglycemia post CABG\nExsmoker\nQuit 2097, >50 pack years\nPeripheral arterial disease\nOccluded distal aorta (diagnosed after cardiac catheterization attempt in 2097)\nSmall infrarenal abdominal aortic aneurysm 3.6cm\nParoxysmal atrial fibrillation (x2 years at least)\nOn coumadin for stroke prevention and amiodarone from maintenance of NSR\nCurrently in NSR\nBPH\nChronic back pain\nRenal insufficiency (Creatinine 4.1) non-oliguric - ?cause\nCr normal November 2097\nGradually increased over November from 1.1-1.6, ang then was ~4 when recently checked\nAttributed to Renal artery stenosis based on non-invasive imaging (duplex, MRI), though \nRight inguinal hernia repair\n\nDenies VTE, denies pulmonary problems.\n\nCurrent Medications:\nECASA 81 mg daily\nAmiodarone 200 mg daily\natenolol 75 mg bid\ncolace 100 mg bid\nheparin 5000 units sc q8h\ninsulin sliding scale q4h\nsimvastatin 40 mg at HS\nezetimibe 10 mg daily\nalbuterol/ipratropium 3/0.5 mg via neb q4h\n\nMedications at Home:\nAmiodarone 200mg daily\nAtenolol 100mg BID\nMetformin HCL 500mg daily\nASA 81mg daily \nLasix 40mg daily,\nlipitor 40mg daily prn\nZetia 10mg daily prn\nCoumadin 5mg qd\t\n\nAllergies:\nFlecainide (arrhythmia).\n\nFamily History:\nNoncontributory.\n\nSocial History:\nMarried, lives at home with his wife.  Exsmoker.  Minimal alcohol, no other substance abuse.\n\nReview of Systems:\nNoncontributary.\n\nPhysical Examination:\nMildly tachypnic RR 24.  BP 160/90 right arm.  HR 60 reg.  Afebrile.\nHead and neck examination unremarkable.  No bruits heard.\nJVP markedly elevated at the angle of the jaw.  The CP is delayed in upstroke, and mildly reduced in volume.  There is S1 S2 and a II/VI SEM that is high pitched and peaks in mid to late systole.  The Apex is hard to feel, but slight diffuse and sustained.  The abdomen is obese, distended, nontender, and there is no organomegaly or masses.  The patent   s distal pulses are difficult to feel, and despite the bilateral TEDS there is bilateral lower extremity edema.\n\n\nInvestigations:\n\nEKG: Normal sinus rhythm\nNote: Aortogram report is not on LMR\n\nNa 140\t\tWBC 6.59\nK 4.3\t\tHgB 8.0\nCl 104\t\tPlt 165\nCO2 25\t\tHct 25.8\nBUN 80\t\tINR 1.2 (coumadin held)\nCr 4.45\t\tPTT 30.8\nEGFR 13\nGlu 74\nCa 8.3\nMg 2.4\n\nImpression and Plan:\n\nThis gentleman is currently mild fluid overloaded (CHF) and hypertensive; this should be improved prior to any proposed surgery.  The issues include:\nCongestive heart failure     I suspect there is worsening fluid retention primarily due to his worsening renal function.  I would consider:\nincreasing his diuretic (eg. Lasix 80 mg iv bid) to improve diuresis and get him euvolemic.  Hopefully this will work; if not, he should have ultrafiltration so that he is not in heart failure for his operation.  He will be at high risk of CHF post-op, and likely will need an ICU bed\nconsider starting hydralazine/nitroglycerin combination in lieu of ACE-inhibitor for afterload reduction\nconsider a pre-op echo     we probably should check his EF and bicuspid aortic valve to exclude severe AI and severe AS\nPrevention of periperative MI\nHe should continue his ASA, atenolol, statins/zetia peri-operatively\nNo further testing for ischemia necessary unless is LV function on echo is markedly reduced (recent CABG, no angina)\nEven with best medical care, for his proposed surgery and his comorbidities he carries a substantial risk for perioperative cardiac complications (roughly 5-10%)\nPrevention of perioperative AF\nContinue his atenolol and amiodarone perioperatively\nRestart coumadin post-op for stroke prevention long term\nEndocarditis prophylaxis\nHe will need perioperative antibiotics given his bicuspid aortic valve\n\nWe will follow with you     he may need a couple of days to treat his heart failure/fluid overload prior to surgery.\n\n\nXIN Xi, MD, PhD\n\n\nStaff Notes:"}

He has been disabled but  has managed to stand  and get himself in and out of the wheelchair.  He began noticing cramps and tingling of both his upper extremities and they felt the same as before he had his cervical laminectomy in 2081. He was unable to grip his cup and began dropping objects. Nerve conduction studies were done in September 2094 the conclusion is that he has bilateral evidence of cervical polyradiculopathy right greater than the left.  evidence of sensory poly neuropathy there is also evidence to suggest a mild mean neuropathy at the wrists bilaterally\n\n\n\n\n\n        Past Medical History:  \n\n1.

CAD S/P CABG X3 in 2087 catheterization done in March 2090.  Recent stress done in May 2094\n\nHistory of CABG, known hypercholesterolemia, hypertension, dyspnea on exertion, cancer, smoking. S/P B/L CEA, Cath '90 - occluded SVG to Cx, patent LIMA. patent SVG to RCA. Admitted with (L) sided chest pain, ruled out for MI by enzymes. Ruled out for aortic dissection by CT. Last Adeno-MIBI 3/2092 - posterior wall MI, Negative for ischemia. PURPOSE(S): Diagnosis of ischemia. DIAGNOSES: Primary diagnosis is chestpain. Additional diagnoses include hypercholesterolemia, coronary artery disease, hypertension, diabetes, hyperlipidemia. MEDICATIONS: Albuterol, ECASA, Furosemide, Lopressor, Losartan. PROCEDURE: The patient underwent an adenosine stress test with exercise. Maximum adenosine dose: 140 ucg/kg/min. Supplemental arm exercise x 0:00 (min:sec). 1 lb hand held weight 1097MBq 99mTc sestamibi were injected intravenously following infusion of adenosine with exercise and tomographic imaging data acquired. Additional data were acquired following intravenous injection of another 406MBq 99mTc sestamibi at rest on the same day. Global LVEF was computed and qualitative assessment of regional systolic function was made. STRESS TEST RESULTS: DURATION @ MAX DOSE (min:sec) 5:00 HR (REST=>MAX) 56 => 74 (50% PREDICTED) BP (INITIAL=>PEAK) 150/60 => 150/60 (MINIMUM = 130/x) PEAK DOUBLE PRODUCT: 11100 ENDPOINT(S): The protocol was completed. Chest pain did not occur. REST ECG: The rest electrocardiogram revealed nonspecific ST segment and T-wave abnormalities. Sinus bradycardia 56/min. First degree AVB STRESS ECG: No ST segment changes were observed during this test. Arrhythmias: None STRESS TEST COMMENTS Negative for ischemia. However, the sensitivity of Adenosine-induced ST segment changes for detecting significant CAD is limited. SCAN RESULTS: The left ventricle is normal in size. There is a moderate reduction in tracer activity in the posterobasal wall of the left ventricle which persists after reinjection at rest. The left ventricular ejection fraction was 50% on the stress study. Regional wall motion abnormalities were noted in the posterior wall on the stress study. CONCLUSIONS: The ECG response to pharmacological stress was negative for ischemia. The myocardial scans show posterobasal infarction without ischemia--LVEF=50%. \n\n\n\n5.

He has co morbid diseases IDDM, HTN, Hyperlipidemia, COPD, Paraplegia, Hx of uti and depression. His last surgery was in 2092 ORIF left Tibia IV sedation with spinal anesthesia no complication noted in anesthesai record..  There has been difficulty placing the IV ( pt said this happens a lot). According to note from 3/07/81 anesthesia for previous cervical Laminectomy  Rapid sequence induction MAC #3 8.0 ETT easy intubation. Pt was a smoker for 50 years occasionally uses Albuterol with a spacer suggested he use it pre op .  He had a stress test done in May 2094 and it was negative for ischemia and a LVEF was 50%.  Report in this note under Medical Problems.  He was admitted for \"chest pain \" in May 2094 and he no longer is using the NTG sl or the Nitropace.  He was told the \"pains\" he feels is most likely from his CABG ( CABG X3)- Grafts to RCA patent,occluded at circumflex, LIMA patent and the post sternal pain. The stress test was done during this admission as well as a CAT scan to r/o aortic dissection. ( also negative)  his biggest problem seems to be his \"not very well controlled diabetes\".  There is a note from the May 2094 admission that he was to receive a trial of Nexium to see if his \"chest pain\" was epigastric\" but pt and wife said he never received this medication.  He denies any GERD or \"chest pain\" since may 2094.  He recognizes his hypoglycemia sx's and  also his hyper glycemia sx's ( blurred vision) when his blood sugar is 480.  He will not take his Glyburide the night before surgery and the morning of.. He will take 1/2 dose of Insulin the morning of 15 untis NPH.

Pt presented to OSH 12/10 with c/o abdominal pain onset the PM prior to admission, diffuse in nature, localized in the mid-epigastric region, RUQ, and LUQ with a pain scale of 8-10/10 pain. Per charts he reported decreased pain in the am with ability to tolerate PO's and then increasing pain that afternoon. Also associated with diaphoresis, + nausea, no vomiting, no sob. During placement of a central line at OSH ED, pt experienced shaking during procedure and had acute loss of motor and sensory strength in the LE's. Per Nursing chart at OSH ED, pt given Morphine for abd pain (around 4p-8p) with coffee ground emesis at 8pm with subsequent decrease in BP to 76/49 and started on dopamine for pressure support. At the same time, pt c/o numbness in feet. Per charts he was reported to be bending forward coughing and vomiting and experienced acute loss of sensation/motor function in the abdomen and lower extremities.\n\nCourse at the outside hospital- \n1.Neuro- acute loss of sensation/motor at the level of T8. Per Neurology, had paraplegic legs, no sphincter tone, no anal wink, Sx were concerning for aortic dissection. Abd US unrevealing but was reported as a poor study. CT of T8-T10 did not show gross deviations of spine, no soft tissue masses or disk bulging.  \n2.GI- Coffee ground emesis at OSH, with no fresh blood- with dropping HCT 44-40-35 and transfused 1 U pRBC on 12/11.  Also guiac +.  Etiology thought to be 2/2 ASA and plavix.  No egd was performed and amlyase and lipase, and LFTs were nl per report.  \n3.ID- Pt was hypotensive with SBP in the 70's on presentation with good response to fluids, In setting of elevated WBC to 22 pt was empirically treated with Abx (zosyn, flagyl and vanc). BCx were sent and CXR appeared clear.\n4.CARDIAC- Cardiac enzymes were followed with increasing Troponins: 0.04    0.07    0.08    0.09, CK index: 3.0    3.7.

Comparison is made with the\n\treport of prior C-spine CT from January 2095.\n\tHistory:72 year old man with history of paraplegia from traumatic\n\tinjury in 2066 with new sensation loss and motor loss below T8.\n\tTechnique:Sagittal T2 images were obtained of the cervical,\n\tthoracic, lumbar spine.  The Axial T2 images are obtained from T10\n\tthrough L1. The images are moderately motion degraded in the\n\tthoracic and lumbar spine.  The cervical spine MRI was repeated\n\tthree times due to motion. No contrast was used.\n\tFindings:\n\tCERVICAL SPINE:\n\tStraightening of the cervical lordosis is noted from C2 through\n\tC6. Bone marrow signal demonstrates patchy areas of T2 high signal\n\twithin the C4 and C5 vertebral body.  Posterior disc osteophyte\n\tcomplexes are present at C2/C3, C3/C4, C4/C5, C5/C6, C6/C7.\n\tThe patient is status post posterior laminectomy and fusion which\n\tcauses susceptibility artifact. The laminectomy from C3 through\n\tC7, previously noted, is not well visualized due to motion\n\tartifact and susceptibility.\n\tTHORACIC SPINE:\n\tThere is partial fusion of T4 to T5 with loss of height of T4 and\n\tfocal kyphosis at this area. Myelomalacia is noted from T1 through\n\tT5. There is focal T2 high signal within the cord substance at the\n\tT4 level.\n\tT2 low signal collections are noted posterior to the cord at T6\n\tthrough T12.  A high signal septation is present through this\n\tcollection at T7 and extending from T11 through L1. This low T2\n\tsignal collection displaces the cord anteriorly from T7 through\n\tT10.\n\tThe cord is small from T7 through T10 consistent with myelomalacia\n\tand high T2 signal.\n\tHigh signal is also present in the cord substance of the distal\n\tthoracic cord and at the conus.\n\tSmall amount of T2 high signal is noted in encircling the distal\n\tthoracic cord and the spinal roots.\n\tLUMBAR SPINE:\n\tStraightening of the lumbar spine is noted with grade 1\n\tretrolisthesis of L4 on L5. There is a levoscoliosis with apex at\n\tL4/L5.\n\tDisc demonstrates T2 shortening within several lumbar discs and\n\tdisc height loss at L4/L5, L5/S1.\n\tT2 high signal at the endplates are noted around the L4/L5 and\n\tL5/S1 disc levels.   Moderate to severe stenosis of the bilateral\n\tneural foramen at L5/S1 facet osteoarthritis and disc height loss\n\tof L5/S1 is noted. The patient has had prior surgery of the\n\tspinous processes of L4 and L5.\n\tThe conus terminates at L1/L2. The spinal roots appear clumped\n\tcentrally and there is T2 high signal around the upper spinal\n\troots. T2 high signal is noted at the distal aspect of the thecal\n\tsac.\nIMPRESSION:\n\t 1.  Low T2 signal collections from T6 through L1 with\n\tdisplacement of the thoracic cord anteriorly from T7 through T10.\n\tThe differential diagnosis for this collection includes unusual\n\tflow artifact or multiloculated septations or epidural\n\tcollections.  Recommend dedicated thoracic and lumbar spine MRI\n\twith contrast and T2 axials through the L spine and C spine. If\n\tclinically indicated, consider repeat C spine MRI with contrast.\n\tDr. Winters was informed of this at 2:15 PM on 12/12/95.\n\t2.  Myelomalacia of the thoracic cord from T4-T5 level and at\n\tT7-10.\n\t3.  The spinal roots are incompletely imaged but have a clumped in\n\tappearance suggesting arachnoiditis. Repeat axial images through\n\tthe entire spinal roots could better evaluate this.\n\t4. Degenerative disc disease of the lumbar spine at L4/L5 and\n\tL5/S1. degenerative disc disease of the cervical spine at C3/C4\n\tC4/C5 C5/C6.\n\t5.  Prior surgical fusion of the cervical spine and laminectomies\n\tare incompletely evaluated on the study due to motion.  Please see\n\tprior CT report for the details.\n\t6.  Mild focal kyphosis with height loss at T4 appears subacute\n\tand may be from prior trauma.\n\nMRI (12/13):\t\nMRI THORACIC AND LUMBAR SPINE WITHOUT AND WITH GADOLINIUM\n\tHistory: History of previous cord compression. Status post recent\n\taorto-bifemoral bypass. Now with sudden onset of loss of lower\n\textremity motor function and sensation.\n\tComparison: MRI spine dated 12/12/95.\n\tProcedure: Multiplanar MR imaging of the entire spine was\n\tperformed without and with Gadolinium.\n\tFindings:\n\tThere is an old compression fracture at T5.  There is exaggeration\n\tof the normal kyphosis at this level.  There is no evidence of\n\tmarrow edema to suggest acute fracture in the spine.  There is\n\tstraightening of the normal lumbar lordosis.  There is grade 1\n\tretrolisthesis of L4 on L5.  There is degenerative change in the\n\tL4-5 and L5-S1 end plates.  There is increased T2 signal in the\n\tL4-5 and L5-S1 discs however the adjacent endplates are well\n\tpreserved, and although infection cannot be completely excluded,\n\tit is considered very unlikely.  There is a small central disc\n\tprotrusion at T8-9.\n\tThere is no evidence of significant canal stenosis in the thoracic\n\tor lumbar spine.\n\tExamination of the cord demonstrates myelomalacia extending from\n\tthe T5 level inferiorly.  There is prominent flow artifact in the\n\tCSF surrounding the myelomalacic cord.  The conus is expanded and\n\tdemonstrates hyperintensity on T2 weighted sequences.  There is no\n\tassociated enhancement.  No vascular flow voids are identified.\n\tThere is a small right pleural effusion.  There is consolidation\n\tat the right lung base.  This may represent atelectasis or\n\tinfiltrate and correlation with chest x-ray is recommended.\nIMPRESSION:\n\tExpansion and signal abnormality in the conus superimposed on\n\tchronic myelomalacia. The differential diagnosis includes cord\n\tinfarction, and demyelinating disease.  Vascular malformation and\n\tneoplasm are considered less likely due to the absence of vascular\n\tflow voids and abnormal enhancement.\n\n\nMRA:  MRA of the aorta with runoff was conducted as per departmental\n\tprotocol.\n\tFINDINGS:\n\tDue to the nature of MRI imaging, dedicated sequences were\n\tperformed to evaluate the vasculature. The remainder of the\n\tabdominal organs are not fully evaluated and if clinically\n\tindicated, directed sequences could be performed.\n\tThis was a technically limited study due to suboptimal contrast\n\tbolus and movement.  The patient was agitated and unable to\n\tcooperate .\n\tNo evidence for an aortic dissection is identified.\n\tThere is moderate stenosis of the left subclavian artery just\n\tbeyond its origin.\n\tThe celiac trunk is patent.\n\tThere is mild/moderate stenosis just beyond the origin of the\n\tsuperior mesenteric artery.\n\tThe renal arteries cannot be assessed on this study.\nIMPRESSION:\n\t1.  Limited study due to technical factors and patient movement\n\thowever no evidence of an aortic dissection is identified.  A\n\trepeat MRI with better contrast bolus and sedation may be obtained\n\tif clinically indicated.\n\t2.  Moderate stenosis is noted just distal to the origin of the\n\tleft subclavian artery.\n3.\tMild/moderate stenosis just beyond the origin of the SMA.\n\nCT Spine (12/13): report pending\n_____________________________________________________________________\nAssessment/Plan: 74 y/o vasculopath presenting with new neurological deficits, abdominal pain, UGI bleed, progressive renal failure, initially worrisome for aortic dissection.

While I know that you are familiar with his history, please allow me to briefly review it for my records.  He is a lovely 53 year old gentleman whose history is remarkable for Hodgkins, status post mantle radiation in the early 70's; coronary artery disease, status post-PCI to the LAD and RCA in '90 and '87, respectively, and recently diagnosed squamous cell lung cancer.  MIBI done at LMC 1/24/94 showed normal EF without perfusion defects (no scar or ischemia); he exercised 10:30 on a standard Bruce iwthout symptoms.  He was admitted 2/94 for elective left upper lobectomy for his squamous cell lung cancer (ASA was stopped 1 week prior to surgery; he was not on plavix preop); in PACU following resection, he had a VT/VF arrest and was taken emergently to the cardiac catheterization lab, where he was found to have a massive volume of thrombus extending throughout his RCA.  After extensive suction catheter use and POBA, a good angiographic result was obtained; no stents were placed due to the heightened thrombotic state that he was in.  Remarkably, echocardiogram revealed normal LV systolic function, with basal inferoposterior HK noted.  His peak TnI was 33.6, his peak CK was 1710, and his peak MB was 87.2.  He had a relatively unremarkable course post-catheterization; plavix initiation was delayed until his chest tube was removed, after which it was started without incident.  He was discharged 2/11/94, and returns today for routine follow-up.  \n\nRegarding his squamous cell lung cancer, it is my understanding that he had no evidence of metastatic disease and that margins were negative; he is not currently planned for any adjuvant therapy, but will be closely followed.  Regarding his remote history of Hodgkins, he is followed at RFPC, and is due for an annual visit there in the next 1-2 months.  \n\nHe has been walking outside for the past ~2 weeks (since the weather improved), walking about 2 miles in around 30 minutes.  He feels well, and has had no problems.  He notes some mild dyspnea with increased exertion (climbing hills), but denies any unusual dyspnea.  He denies chest pain, SOB at rest, orthopnea (stable 2 pillow use), PND, edema, palpitaitons, or claudication.  He brings with him a handwritten record of his recent hemodynamics - his BP runs in the 100-120's/60-80's, with rare systolics in the 130's.  His heart rate has been in the 70-80's.  \n\nHis past medical history includes:\n CAD s/p IMI '88 (totally occluded RCA with good collaterals, revascularized with 3 stents to the RCA), MI '90 (LAD stent), inferior STEMI 2/94 as above s/p POBA\n VF arrest in setting of STEMI\n Hodgkin's '81 - splenectomy, XRT\n LUL squamous cell cancer s/p L upper lobectomy 2/94\n hyperlipidemia (low HDL and high LDL - tried niaspan in the past without much benefit)\n hypothyroid\n basal cell skin CA\n nephrolithiasis\n\nHis medications include:\n Lipitor 80 mg\n Plavix 75 mg\n ASA 325 mg po QD\n Lopressor 200 mg po BID\n Prilosec 20 mg\n\nHe has a history of intolerance (dizziness) with lisinopril.\n\nHis family history is notable for hyperlipidemia and hypertension, but negative for CAD.\n\nHe works in consulting, and travels around the Midwest as part of his job.  He is now back at work.  He is married, and lives in Lincoln City.  He and his wife have 4 children, ages 15 / 17 / 20 / 24; they have no pets.  He has never smoked cigarettes.  He drinks 3 glasses of wine/week, and a cup of coffee qam.\n\nOn physical exam today, he has a heart rate of 68 and a blood pressure of 134/75.  He is a well developed well nourished gentleman in no apparent distress.  His JVP is flat sitting at 90 degrees, and he has no carotid bruits.  His lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally.  He has a regular rate and rhythm with a normal S1 S2, and no murmurs, rubs, or gallups.  His abdomen is benign.  He is warm and well perfused peripherally without significant edema, and with 2+ PT pulses bilaterally.\n\nHis EKG in clinic today is NSR at 68, with possible LAE, a nonspeciifc IVCD, and inferior Q waves in III/F, consistent with an inferior MI.  He has increased voltages consistent with LVH.\n\nHis recent cardiac tests include: \n - echo 2/94 - EF 60%, basal inferoposterior HK, normal atrai, no significant valvular disease\n - cath 2/94 - right dominant system, patent LAD stent, proximal 60% LCx, proximal 90% thrombotic RCA occlusion (in-stent) with 100% ostial R-PDA thrombotic lesion s/p Angiojet/POBA with TIMI-3 excellent angiographic result \n\nIn summary, this is a 53 year old man who had a VF arrest in the setting of perioperative inferior STEMI, status post extensive angiojet and POBA of acute in-stent thrombosis of presumed bare metal stents in his RCA.  He is asymptomatic from a cardiovascular standpoint, and somewhat remarkably did not take a large myocardial hit from this life-threatening event.  Our attention now shifts to the prevention of future events.  Given the degree of thrombus burden in his RCA at the time of cath, he is someone for whom we would strongly advise lifelong plavix and aspirin.  Furthermore, he is not someone for whom I would be comfortable with even temporary discontinuation of one of these agents - we would advise that ANY future procedures be done on aspirin and plavix.  His blood pressure and heart rate are well controlled on his current regimen, as demonstrated by his home records.  I have taken the liberty today of changing him from lopressor 200 bid to toprol 200 bid to minimize any ups and downs in his beta blockade, but otherwise, would not make any changes to his regimen at this time.  We will check a full set of labs today, but I suspect that no further changes will be required at this time.  \n\nGiven his history of Hodgkin's, as well as his known CAD, he is clearly at risk for future events, and I suspect that we will take a rather aggressive stance in terms of monitoring for ischemia.  Certainly, if he has any concerning symptoms, we would have a low threshold to pursue an aggressive course.  At present, however, I am delighted with how well he is doing.  \n\nIt was a pleasure to see Mr. Hall in cardiology clinic today.  I will plan to see him in follow-up in 6 months time, but he knows to call sooner should he have any problems or concerns.  \n\nRegards,\n\n_____________________________________________\nFlorence Heather Gil, M.D., Ph.D.\n\nCC: Dr. Nick Golden\n        Thoracic Surgery \n        Wytheville South Hospital\n\n        Dr. Paul Reilly\n        Riverside Family Practice Center\nRecord date: 2095-01-31\n\nEDVISIT^65219816^HALL, NICK^01/31/95^PENN, GINO\n\nThe patient was seen and examined in the Emergency Department on\n\n01/31/2095.

As I'm sure you recall, he is a lovely 54 year old gentleman whose history of Hodgkins disease status-post mantle radiation in the early 70's, squamous cell lung cancer status post left upper lobectomy 1/94, and coronary artery disease, status post-PCI to the LAD and RCA in '90 and '87, respectively, and perioperative VT/VF arrest at the time of his LUL resection 1/94.  At that time, emergent catheterization revealed massive volume of thrombus extending throughout his RCA, managed with extensive suction catheter use and POBA, with a good angiographic result.  No stents were placed given the thrombus burden.  Remarkably, subsequent echocardiogram revealed normal LV systolic function, with basal inferoposterior HK noted.  His peak TnI was 33.6, his peak CK was 1710, and his peak MB was 87.2.  He had a relatively unremarkable course post-catheterization; plavix initiation was delayed until his chest tube was removed, after which it was started without incident.  He was discharged 2/11/94, and had done well until 1/31/2095, when he presented to WSH with unstable angina, having noted new sudden onset angina and dyspnea while making his daily walk.  He had a positive troponin, and was taken urgently to cardiac catheterization, which revealed a proximal LAD lesion (felt to be the culprit) and ostial RCA lesion, both of which were stented with CYPHER stents.  At that time the decision was made to increase his plavix from 75 to 150 as an attempt to maximize his medical management, given his history and disease burden.  \n\n\nSince that admission, he has done exceedingly well, and presents today without complaints.  He continues to walk 2 miles ~4 times/week without exertional symptoms.  He specifically denies chest pain, dyspnea, orthopnea, PND, or lower extremity edema.  He has had no palpitations, dizziness/presyncope, or claudication.  He has significantly modified his diet to eliminate dairy and hydrogenated products/snacks, with a 5# weight loss, and is motivated to further reduce his weight.  He states that he feels \"great\" and isdoing quite well.  He does not that occasionally at this work, when he is frustrated/upset, he will take his pressure and find his systolic to be ~150, but this comes down within minutes if he relaxes, and his pressures are great at home.  He has had no GI symptoms on the aggressive antiplatelet regimen, despite not being on a PPI.\n\n\nRegarding his squamous cell lung cancer, it is my understanding that he had no evidence of metastatic disease and that margins were negative; he is not currently planned for any adjuvant therapy, but will be closely followed.  His most recent imaging was 11/94, which was negative for evidence of metastasis by repor.  Regarding his remote history of Hodgkins, he is followed at RFPC on an annual basis.  \n\n\nHis past medical history includes:\n  CAD s/p IMI '88 (totally occluded RCA with good collaterals, revascularized with 3 stents to the RCA), MI '90 (LAD stent), inferior STEMI 2/94 as above s/p POBA\n  VF arrest in setting of STEMI\n  Hodgkin's '81 - splenectomy, XRT\n  LUL squamous cell cancer s/p L upper lobectomy 2/94\n  hyperlipidemia (low HDL and high LDL - tried niaspan in the past without much benefit)\n  hypothyroid\n  basal cell skin CA\n  nephrolithiasis\n\n\nHis medications include:\n  Lipitor 80 mg\n  Plavix 150 mg\n  ASA 325 mg po QD\n  Toprol 200 mg po BID\n  Levoxyl\n  Omega-3-fatty acids\n  Multivitamin\n\n\nHe has a history of intolerance (dizziness) with lisinopril.\n\n\nHis family history is notable for hyperlipidemia and hypertension, but negative for CAD.\n\n\nHe works in consulting, and travels around the midwest as part of his job.  He also works a few days a week at the local supermarket cashiering , and works as a museum docent a few times a week.  He is married, and lives in Lincoln City.  He and his wife have 4 children, ages 15 / 17 / 20 / 24; they have no pets.  He has never smoked cigarettes.  He drinks 1 glass of wine a night.\n\n\nOn physical exam today, he has a heart rate of 75 and a blood pressure of 129/81, with a weight of 220#.  He is a well developed well nourished gentleman in no apparent distress.  His JVP is ~7-8 cm; he has no carotid bruits.  His lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally.  He has a regular rate and rhythm with a normal S1 and a physiologically split S2, and no murmurs, rubs, or gallups.  His abdomen is benign.  He is warm and well perfused peripherally without significant edema, and with 2+ PT pulses bilaterally.\n\n\nHis EKG in clinic today is NSR at 75 with possible left atrial abnormality, a nonspeciifc IVCD, and inferior Q waves in III/F, consistent with an inferior MI. \n\n\nIn summary, this is a 54 year old man who had a VF arrest in the setting of perioperative inferior STEMI, status post extensive angiojet and POBA of acute in-stent thrombosis of presumed bare metal stents in his RCA, who represented 1 year later (1/95) with NSTEMI now s/p PCI to his RCA and LAD.  He is now asymptomatic status post this intervention  Given his history, we agree with antiplatelet therapy, with a plan for lifelong plavix and aspirin.  Should he require future invasive diagnostic procedures, it would be reasonable to decrease doses to 75 plavix/81 ASA, but we would not favor DC of either of these medications altogether.  His blood pressure and heart rate are well controlled on his current regimen, as demonstrated by his home records.  His LDL is near goal, with a low HDL that was unaffected by high-dose niaspan in the past.  I share his hope that with further diet/weight loss and exercise, these will both improve to goal.  \n\n\nAs I have discussed with he and his wife, given his history of Hodgkin's, as well as his known CAD, he is clearly at risk for future events, including the possibility of bypass surgery in the future.  We will be guided by his symptoms, and he knows to call me if he has any problems/symptoms.  It was a pleasure to see Mr. Hall in cardiology clinic today.  I will plan to see him in follow-up in 6 months time, but he knows to call sooner should he have any problems or concerns. \n\n\nRegards,\n_____________________________________________\nFlorence Heather Gil, M.D., Ph.D.\n\n\nCC: Dr. Nick Golden\n         Thoracic Surgery \n         Wytheville South Hospital\n\n\n         Dr. Paul Reilly\n         Riverside Family Practice Center\nRecord date: 2096-03-10\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHALL, NICK\n65219816\n03/10/2096\n\n\n\n\nYoussef Nall, M.D.\nLudlow Medical Center\n45 Wilder St\nPost, IN  86454\n\n\nDear Dr. Nall:\n\n\nIt was a pleasure to see Nick Hall again in the Cardiology clinic at Wytheville South Hospital in followup of his post myocardial infarction care.  As you are well aware, he has many coronary risk factors.  He is a 55-year-old gentleman with past history Hodgkin's disease, status post mantle radiation in the early 2070s and left upper lobe lobectomy in 2094 for early stage squamous cell lung cancer that was complicated by VT/VF arrest.  He has history of hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, as well as overweight.  He does not have a former history of type 2 diabetes, but on recent screening, his hemoglobin A1c has been elevated at 8%.  His prior history of coronary artery disease dates back to 2087 and 2090 when he had non-ST elevation MI and coronary interventions to his LAD and RCA.  He has subsequently had a VT/VF arrest during his lobectomy in 2094, which required emergent coronary angiographic resuscitation where he was found to have a massive thrombus throughout his right coronary artery that required thrombectomy and POBA with good results.  He remarkably has had a preserved LV function after all of these infarctions with only some basal inferoposterior hypokinesis.  In 01/2095, he developed recurrent exertional and then unstable angina, presented to Wytheville Sanitarium Hospital Emergency where he was considered to be high risk acute coronary artery syndrome with positive troponins and proceeded to the catheterization clinic where he again had proximal LAD and RCA occlusions, both which were intervened with drug-eluting Cypher stents with good results.  Since then, he has been doing well and has been instructed to be on double dose clopidogrel 150 mg lifelong and full dose aspirin 325 mg p.o. daily lifelong.\n\n\nWe see him in followup today, and again, he has no limitations in his exertional capacity.  Work has been tough in consulting and he is now working 2 jobs including overnight shifts, which is strenuous at times.  He is looking for work as a dog walker and will find out soon whether he can quit his evening jobs and will be able to increase his exercise capacity such that he will be doing more walking with that job.  He has no chest pain, shortness of breath, palpitations, presyncope, or syncope with exertion.  He has no signs or symptoms of heart failure.  He has been taking his blood pressures at home, which range at about 126/81 to 142/92 with an average of 135/85.  His heart rates have been in 50s-70s.  He has had no side effects to his medications.  He is not smoking and he is not drinking alcohol.  He says that he walks for 2-3 miles when the weather is nice, but given that it has been a harsh winter, he has not been doing this often.\n\n\nHis current medications, aspirin 325 mg p.o. daily, clopidogrel 150 mg p.o. daily, atorvastatin 80 mg p.o. daily, levothyroxine 125 mcg p.o. daily, and metoprolol sustained release 200 mg p.o. b.i.d.\n\n\nPhysical Examination: Nick looked well.  His weight was 232 pounds, his blood pressure was 153/89 in the right arm and 150/95 in the left arm with a large cuff, and his heart rate was 69 and regular.  His head and neck exam revealed normal jugular venous pressure and normal carotid upstroke and contour.  There are no bruits.  His chest is clear to auscultation.  He was not clubbed.  His cardiovascular exam revealed a normal left apex and normal S1 and S2 with no additional gallops, rubs, or murmurs.  He had no peripheral edema.  His abdomen was soft and nontender with no organomegaly.  His pulses were palpable 2+ throughout.\n\n\nEKG:  Normal sinus rhythm, heart rate 61, minimal voltage criteria for LVH and left atrial enlargement.  Prior inferior Q-wave MI.\n\n\nLab values from today:  His electrolyte panel was notable for sodium 144, potassium 4.1, chloride 107, bicarb 28, creatinine 1, urea 16, normal calcium, normal LFTs, and normal CK level.  TSH was also normal.  Hemoglobin A1c was elevated at 6.8%.\n\n\nLipid levels:  Total cholesterol 164, TG 145, HDL 33, LDL 102.\n\n\nEchocardiogram from last year revealed normal LV ejection fraction of 60%-65%.  Mild left atrial enlargement, no LVH.\n\n\nImpression:  Nick is still borderline hypertensive, and in the setting of having survived multiple myocardial infarctions, Hodgkin lymphoma and now declaring himself as potential glucose intolerant and early diabetic, I think it is time to start an ACE inhibitor as we have discussed previously.  We started him on ramipril 2.5 mg today and he will increase that to 5 mg a day after tolerating it for 2 weeks.  He will take his blood pressures at home few times a week.  To simplify and decrease his beta-blocker regimen we switched to atenolol 100mg daily today.  We also discussed increasing his lipid management by adding niacin again starting at 500 mg extended release for a month and then he will increase that to 1 g a day.  He was cautioned on the adverse potential reactions of facial flushing and headache and he was instructed to take his aspirin 325 about 30 minute prior to his niacin to minimize these potential side effects.\n\n\nWith regards to his coronary artery disease, all this time we have assumed that his atherosclerosis has been secondary to high dose radiation exposure when he was a child.  Nevertheless, Dr. Turner had a great suggestion that we screen him for quantitative platelet function inhibition, given we recently started performing this test at WSH and previously had recurrence on normal strength doses of clopidogrel and aspirin.  The results may not changes our current management strategy, but it may give us insight into his premature CAD etiology, particularly coronary artery thrombus, as well as play a future role in familial screening.  To that end, we have requested light transmission aggregometry for platelet function inhibition.  We have also requested a thrombophilia workup, including factor V Leiden, prothrombin gene mutation, protein C and S levels, antithrombin level and homocysteine and CRP today.\n\n\nOtherwise, I believe Nick is doing well.  We will see him again in 6 months' time with follow up on these studies.  If by then he still has evidence of diabetes, and trouble losing weight, we will refer him to our nutritionist for counseling and refer him to hadley memorial hospital.  He may need a structured monitored exercise program in order to help improve his exercise capacity.  \n\n\nThis patient was discussed with Dr. Turner in clinic.\n\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n______________________________\nDictated by: Yisroel F Cooley, MD MPH FRCPC\nEmail: yfcooley@wsh.org\n\n\n\n\n______________________________\nPaul Turner, MD\nATTENDING\n\n\neScription document:8-4867586 HFFocus\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDD: 03/10/96\nDT: 03/11/96\nDV: 03/10/96\nHALL, NICK\n\n65219816\n\n06/14/2097\n\n\n\n\n\nPrimary Care Physician:\n\nYoussef Nall, M.D.\n\nLudlow Medical Center\n\n10 Wilder St\n\nPost, IN  86454\n\n\n\nDear Dr. Nall:\n\n\n\nIt was a pleasure to see Nick again in the Internal Medicine at Wytheville South Hospital on 06/14/2098 for routine folow up of radiation associated ischemic heart disease.  \n\n\nAs you know, Nick had mantle radiation in his youth for Hodgkin's lymphoma, and subsequently had 2 NSTEMIs in 2087 and 2090.  He received bare-metal stents to his LAD and RCA and did well until 2094 when after diagnosis and resection of a squamous cell lung carcinoma, his postop course was immediately complicated by an acute inferior STEMI/VT/VF arrest.  Immediate angiography post-resuscitation found massive thrombus burden in his proximal right coronary artery, with good result after thrombectomy and POBA, in addition to Integrilin, aspirin, Plavix, and low dose heparin.  Remarkably, after an IABP and aggressive care Nick walked away with a preserved LV function after this event.  He did well until 01/2095 when he represented with unstable angina and was found to have in-stent restenosis in the ostial LAD and the ostial RCA bare-metal stents.  He was treated with Cypher drug-eluting stents to both lesions (3.5 x 18 mm Cypher stent post dilated to 20 atm to the LAD and 3.5 x 23 mm extending slightly into the sinus of Valsalva to the RCA) with no residual stenosis.  Because of concerns with regards to recurrent in-stent restenosis he was put on dual antiplatelet therapy (325mg ECASA and clopidogrel 150 mg) since that event intended as longterm therapy.  He has been followed by me since 2095 with no recurrent ischemic heart disease, chest pain, and has returned to normal exercise capacity and with preserved cardiac systolic function.  \n\n\nNick continues to be very successful as a technology consultant in IBM research in Leland.  As the economy is picking up, his work environment has improved as has his stress level.  He is walking every day both at work and recreationally and lost another 5pounds.  He takes his medications regularly and is usually compliant  but ran out of atenolol last week and instead has been taking bid ramipril in its place.  Every year he asks whether we can down-titrate his clopidogrel both for tolerance and cost reasons (I reassured him that it should be generic within a year).  Nevertheless, we tested the degree of platelet inhibition he currently has with the VerifyNow P2Y12 PRU assay, and his result was 177, which is below the cut-off of 230 PRU thought to approximate adequate platelet inhibition.\n  He recently had some transient melena for which he was placed on ranitidine.\n\n\n\n\nHis current medications should be aspirin 325 mg p.o. daily, clopidogrel 150 mg p.o. daily, atorvastatin 80 mg p.o. daily, ramipril 10 mg p.o. daily, atenolol 50 mg p.o. daily, L-thyroxine 125 mcg p.o. daily, ranitidine 150 mg po daily, 1 tablet fish oil daily, and 1 tablet of vitamin D daily. \nHe has no known drug allergies.\n\n\n\n\nPhysical Examination:  Nick looks well.  He is in no distress. Weight is 221 lbs.  Blood pressure is 150/80 in the right arm repeated over 3 manual measurements with a large manual cuff and his heart rate is 70 and regular.  His head and neck exam revealed normal jugular venous pressure, normal carotid upstroke and contour with no bruits.  His chest is clear to auscultation.  His cardiovascular exam demonstrated normal left apex and normal first and second heart sounds with a normal splitting of the second heart sound with no additional gallops, rubs, or murmurs.  He had no peripheral edema.  His abdomen is soft and nontender with no organomegaly.  He had 2+ pulses in the peripheral exam.\n\n\n\nEKG today demonstrated sinus rhythm at 88 bpm with voltage criteria for LVH, LAE and prior inferior Q-waves.\n\n\nWe are awaiting an updated lipid profile due this week before modifying his lipid therapy which is aimed to target a goal of less than 70 mg/dL.  He has tried and failed a trial of niacin in the past due to intolerable flushing and headache.  His LDL last year was 98 mg/dL though HDL has improved to 37 mg/dL. His TC/HDL ratio is 4.2, his TC is 155 mg/dL, and TG 101 mg/dL.  HbA1c is 7.2%.\n\n\nThe previous echo in 2096 demonstrated normal LV size and function with a normal LV ejection fraction of 60%-65% with no signs of LVH.\n\n\n\nImpression:  Nick is doing well with CCS 1 symptoms after repeated MIs most recently in 2095 due to accelerated coronary atheroclerosis and radiation stenoses.  \n\n\nTo target his coronary risk factors, I recommended the following:\n\n1.  Should his LDL be &gt;70mg/dL he should switch to rosuvastatin 40mg daily for LDL and HDL improvement.\n\n2.  Given clopidorel platelet reactivity is less than 230 PRU he will decrease to 75 mg daily and we will re-check his PRU activity after at least 7 days on this dose.  Should PRU &gt; 230 he will either need to restart 150 mg daily and take a PPI like pantoprazole or switch to prasugrel (or when available ticagrelor).\n3.  He will continue a healthy heart diet and exercise and we will see him again in 6 months.\n\n\n\nThank you for allowing me to participate in his care.  As I am not continuing a general out-patient clinic next year, Nick will transition to another cardiologist who can accomodate his day off from work which is typically on Saturday.  \n\n\nThe patient was discussed in clinic with Dr. Neale Xiao who agreed with this plan.\n\n\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n______________________________\n\nDictated by: Yisroel F Cooley, MD MPH FRCPC\nEmail: yfcooley@wsh.org"}

Briefly, the\n\npatient is a 71-year-old female with several cardiovascular risk\n\nfactors. She was admitted to the hospital in January after a\n\nprolonged episode of palpitations. The patient had a tiny\n\nTroponin  elevation to 0.3, and the decision was made to manage\n\nher conservatively. The patient continues to have these episodes\n\nof palpitations, but she does not get chest pain with any\n\nexercise.\n\n \n\nHer current medical regimen includes aspirin, beta-blocker,\n\nstatin and an ACE Inhibitor. \n\n \n\nOn physical examination she has 2+ carotids, which have normal\n\nupstrokes and no bruits. Her lungs are clear to auscultation. Her\n\nheart examination reveals a regular rate with a normal S1 and S2,\n\nwithout S3 and S4.\n\n \n\nHer electrocardiogram is normal.\n\n \n\nAssessment: I concur with Dr. Zapien in that we will increase the\n\npatient's beta-blockers to decrease her probable supraventricular\n\ntachycardia. She will be seen back here in several months.\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nVasilios C.

She was hospitalized for acute MI last December and is being followed by cardiology.  Since her last follow-up the patient has had no episodes of exertional or rest chest pain, no DOE or SOB.  She was visiting her relatives in Oregon this month and did have one episode of SVT in setting of viral URI.  Experienced sudden onset of palpitations with discomfort, lasted 30 minutes without chest pain, lightheadedness or diaphoresis and then resolved spontaneously.  She has had no further episodes.  She has been compliant with her medications over the last few months and has not experienced any side effects; however, when asked directly, has had 2 or 3 episodes of lightheadedness in morning with abrupt position changes, nothing long-lasting and no near syncope.\n\n     Pt reports blood sugars by finger stick at home of 100-140s generally.

As you know, she is a\nvery pleasant 72-year-old woman with diabetes, hypertension,\ndyslipidemia, active tobacco use, there is probable coronary\ndisease, with preserved left ventricular function (EF 60% on\necho), as well as paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia.  She\nlast saw me in clinic in 03/2077, and missed several followup\nappointments in part because she spends much of her time in\nOregon.  Over the past year and several months, Ms. Quinley has\nbeen doing quite well.  She states that she has episodes of\npalpitations approximately every 2 months, lasting less then 5\nminutes.  She notes a sensation of fluttering in her chest, with\nno chest tightness, no dyspnea, no lightheadedness, no syncope. \nShe denies PND, orthopnea, or angina.  Unfortunately, Ms. Quinley\ncontinues to smoke, but is actively interested in quitting.  She\nstates that she is planning to enroll in the Stonybrook Smoking\nCessation Program.\n\nHer current medications include enteric-coated Aspirin 325 mg\nq.d., atenolol 100 mg q.d., lisinopril 20 mg q.d., Lipitor 20 mg\nq.h.s., metformin 1000 mg b.i.d., Micronase, fluocinolone,\nProtonix, and Allegra.\n\nOn examination, she is well appearing today in no distress. \nBlood pressure is 128/60 mmHg in the right arm, and pulse is 65\nbeats per minute.  Extremities are warm, with no peripheral\nedema.  Carotid upstrokes are brisk bilaterally with no bruits. \nJVP is 8 cm of water.  Chest is clear to auscultation and\npercussion bilaterally.  PMI is nondisplaced, with a normal S1,\nphysiologically split S2, soft S4, no murmurs, no rubs.  Abdomen\nis soft with no masses or hepatomegaly.  Pulse examination is\nnormal.\n\nRecent lipid profile from 03/2078 reveals a LDL of 150.\n\nECG today demonstrates normal sinus rhythm at 67 beats per\nminute, PR interval 154, QRS duration 78, QT interval 442, QTC\n467, and QRS axis 33 degrees.  There is a nonspecific Q-wave\nabnormality, and prolonged QT, with no significant change\ncompared to prior.\n\nIn summary, Ms. Quinley is doing quite well.  Her palpitations and\nlikely SVT are occuring at a frequency that Ms. Quinley feels are\nquite acceptable for her.  Therefore, she wishes no consideration\nof possible interventions or changes in her medical regimen.  She\nhas no symptoms to suggest current coronary ischemia.  Regarding\nher cardiovascular risk factors, her blood pressure is reasonably\nwell controlled today, and you are actively managing her\ndiabetes.  However, her lipid profile demonstrates an elevated\nLDL.  Therefore, I have taken liberty of increasing her Lipitor\nto 40 mg q.h.s.\n\nI plan to see Ms. Quinley in followup in approximately 6 months. \nPlease feel free to contact me otherwise regarding her\ncardiovascular issues.  Thank you very much for referring this\nvery pleasant woman for cardiovascular care.  \n\nMs. Quinley was seen, examined, and discussed with our clinic\npreceptor, Dr. Queen Frank-Newman.\n\n\n\n\n\n______________________________\nUriel Patrick Zapien, MD\n\n\nDictated By: Uriel Patrick Zapien\n\n\neScription document:1-8289950 AFFocus\n\n\n\nDD: 10/05/78\nDT: 10/05/78\nDV: 10/05/78\nRecord date: 2082-04-29\n\n \nVital Signs\nAGE 76y2.3m \nBLOOD PRESSURE 128/70 \nWEIGHT 217 lb \nO2 sat 97%\n\n76  year old patient presents for the following: follow-up of DM, hypertension\nAlso presents for Physical examination and screening pelvic and pap test\ndenies thirst, nocturia\ndenies pelvic pain, vaginal itch, discharge. no postmenopausal bleeding\ncontinues to smoke, changed brands in order to help her eventually stop or cut down\nhas a cough, postnasal drip. uses loratadine but not using nasal inhaler\nMedications:  per list\nAllergy:  NKA \nHabits:  walks for exercise. eats some vegetables most days. denies ETOH/illicit substance use. takes multivits and calcium\ndenies safety concerns\n\nROS - denies weight change, fevers, chills, sweats\ndenies rash or skin lesion\ndenies headache, sensory disturbance, muscle weakness\ndenies depression, anxiety, sleep disturbance\ndenies GI distress, change in appetite or bowel habits\ndenies joint pain, swelling\ndenies urinary discomfort/frequency\ndenies CP/SOB/PND/orthopnea/change in exercise tolerance\ndenies wheezing\nPE\nVS as noted\nNAD\nalert and oriented x 3\nskin - no rash or lesion\ndiscs sharp, normal vascular caliber OU\nswelling beneath both eyes - inverted eye lids\nTMs intact AU\nno sinus tenderness\nno oral lesion, no pharyngeal inflammation or exudate\nno thyroid enlargement or tenderness\nno cervical/ax/ing lymphadenopathy\nchest clear to ausc RR 12\ncardiac normal s1/s2 no m/s3/s4 HR 70 reg\nbreasts no mass/tend/discharge  performs BSE regularly\nabd no mass/tend/organomegaly BS+ throughout\npelvic: vulva/vagina - normal mucosa, no discharge/ulceration  normal urinary meatus\ncervix - no motion tenderness or discharge.

No seizure activity. He was brought to BMH where he indicated he had had 2 similar episodes in previous month. \nConcern for cardiac orig1n given lack of posterior fossa signs, orthostasis at BMH, hx of seizure symptoms, and significant trauma. He ruled out for MI, had TTE showing EF 59% but had inf. WMA and LA dilation. Cardiology was therefore consulted. An adenoMIBI stress test was later performed and revealed mild inf. lat reversible ischemia, therefore a LHCath was performed and showed moderate non-intervenable lesions in the RCA and distal PLV. The patient also underwent an EP study that was non-diagnostic. An implantable loop recorder was placed on 6/21. Other work up of syncope included CNIs showing mild RICA stenosis; neurology consult thought these findings were unlikely to be the cause of his syncope and agreed with continued evaluation of cardiac etiologies.\n    \nIn hospital, was noted that pt had had 40 lb weight loss over previous months. Surgery was consulted regarding prompt need for intervention of a known hernia, their evaluation was that the hernia was benign without signs of obstruction and there was no need for inpatient intervention. Endocrine w/u included nl TSH and cortstim. The patient had had a recent Chest and Abd CT and colonoscopy that had no evidence of pancreatic or colonic massess. SPEP and BNP wnl and; his PSA was elevated at 9.56, however alk phos, bone survey, bone scan were all normal. The patient's nutrition and PO intake improved greatly s/p treatment for constipation with an aggressive bowel regimen. \n   \nJust prior to d/c, after returning from an uncomplicated EP study the patient started to exhibit inappropriate behavior (showing stool when not requested to staff) and stating bizarre thoughts (\"I lost my mortal soul\"). Psychiatry was consulted and suspected the patient was having a psychotic episode in setting of prolonged\nhospitalization and multiple diagnostic interventions. It was concluded that an inpatient geri-psych hospitalization was required.\n\nHospitalization done on Psych floor. Per psych eval, pt had been withdrawn and depressed for 8 months with poor sleep, anhedonia, and decreased energy. The pt believed that he had died some time ago and was currently in hell. He stated that he had been feeling that he had sinned so horribly, that God could not forgive him. He stated that he had died, and then further stated that by this he meant that though he might be     physically alive, because he could not be forgiven, he was for all intents and purposes, spiritually dead. He had been having vivid dreams and had been told that he had exalted himself above god and for that would be punished.\n           \nOn the inpt ward, Mr. Shepherd was started on zyprexa 5 mg which was titrated up to a dose of 20 mg qHS. Cymbalta was initiated and titrated up to 60mg qDay with gradual and signficant improvement in his mood.  The patient also expressed difficulty sleeping which responded to Remeron 15mg. At the time of discharge, the patient reported good appetite, adequate sleep (about 8 hours a night, occasional awakening with nocturia), and significant improvement of his depression.  He further noted that his thoughts of being doomed to hell were still occasionally present, though much less intense than upon admission, and he reported that he was able to  challenge this belief \"most of the time.\n\nNeuropsych testing performed during inpt stay showing significant cognitive impairment. He had global deficits in language, memory, visual-spatial abilities, executive functioning, and attention. He had very poor learning of new information.      \n     \nPt was discharged to home with an intake appointment in the Jones Hospital\nPsychiatry scheduled for the following day.\n\nHe has since followed up with Frances Talley, where Zyprexa dose slowly tapered to decrease grogginess. \n \nToday, patient reports improved mood, no longer feels down, no longer feels guilty, as though in hell. Has continued to taper down Zyprexa to 3.75mg QHS. Saw Dr. Nobles on Wednesday, felt that patient should continue to stay on low dose Zyprexa for now. Pt as fell has been tapering down Cymbalta as well, taking it QOD.\n\nReports some intermittent aches in right groin secondary to inguinal hernia.

They were associated with a prodrome of lightheadedness and weakness that sometimes occurred with positional changes and at other times at rest.  He denied associated chest pain, palpitations, diaphoresis, vertigo, focal neurologic weakness, dysphagia, diplopia or blurry vision occur during the episodes. These spells lasted about 4-5 minutes and there were no incontinence, post-ictal symptoms, or tonic-clonic movements.   \n\nHis workup included a surface echocardiogram that showed an ejection fraction of 59% but with inferior wall motion abnormalities.  A subsequent adenosine MIBI showed mild inferolateral ischemia and a cardiac catheterization showed 40% ostial RCA disease and a 75% lesion in a small diameter distal PLV.  The culprit lesion was felt to be non-intervenable and the patient was started on medical therapy.  During his admission, his telemetry showed a twelve beat run of non-sustained ventricular tachycardia and so the electrophysiology service was called.  He underwent an electrophysiology study which was nondiagnostic and a REVEAL monitor was implanted.  Prior to his discharge, the patient exhibited features of depression with psychotic features and he was ultimately transferred to the in-patient psychiatry unit for about four weeks. \n\nToday, he presents with no acute complaints.  He denies chest pain, dyspnea, or palpitations.  He   s had no further fainting spells and reports that his last REVEAL interrogation was unremarkable.  His claudication is at his baseline.  He walks at a mall for 30 minutes to 1 hour before he experiences a \"tired\" sensation in both legs.  He is followed in the vascular clinic at the FHV medical center.  Also of note, he underwent a repair of a right inguinal hernia in October of 2094 by Dr. Small without complications.  \n\n\n\tPast medical history:\n   Coronary artery disease\n *status post cardiac catheterization showing 40% ostial RCA disease and distal PLV disease\n *medical therapy, no intervention\nDiabetes mellitus, type 2\nHypertension\nHyperlipidemia\nBenign prostatic hypertrophy\nRight external carotid stenosis\nPeripheral vascular disease with claudication\n *followed at FHV vascular clinic\nGlaucoma\nVentral hernia\n\n\t\n\n\tAllergies:\n\t\nNo known allergies\n\n\n\tMedications (Confirmed):\n\n\t\nASA  325mg po daily\nbrimonidine  0.2% x 1 drop ou bid\nCardura  4mg po daily\nCymbalta  60mg po daily\nRemoved - Lasix  20mg po daily\nlisinopril  40mg po daily\nMiraLax  17g PO daily\nPletal  100mg PO bid\nsenna  2tabs PO bedtime\nToprol XL  100mg po daily\nZocor  80mg po qpm\nZyprexa  3.75mg po at bedtime\n\n\n\tFamily history:\n   Mom MI at age 63; grandson w/ h/o sudden LOC at age 16 with negative w/u by peds; otherwise, no h/o sudden death.\n\n\n\tSocial history:\n   Retired Archive Manager who lives with wife; has 6 children\n\nHRB: quit smoking 20 years ago 40 pack-yr smoking history; no EtOH; no drugs\n\n\n\tReview of systems:\n   General: unremarkable\nSkin: unremarkable\nHEENT: unremarkable\nRespiratory: unremarkable\nCardiovascular: see above\nGastrointestinal: unremarkable\nGenitourinary: nocturia\nEndocrine: unremarkable\nMusculoskeletal: unremarkable\nNeurologic: unremarkable\nPsychiatric: unremarkable\n\nPhysical examination:\n\t\n-BMI: 30.2  Obese, high risk\n-Pulse: 56  regular\n-resp. rate: 100%  room air\n-height: 68  in.\n-weight: 198  lbs.\n-General:   pleasant and in no distress\n-Skin:   unremarkable\n-HEENT:   PERRL EOMI OP clear\n-Neck:   bilateral carotid bruits; JVP~5 cm normal contours, no Kussmaul's\n-Chest:   CTAB no dullness\n-Cardiac:   Left ventricular impulse discrete and nondisplaced.

He in fact saw Dr. Atwood on 11/10 and had a good DP pulse at that time on the left.  However, one week ago he sat on the floor for ~3 hours doing electrical work, flexed at the hip and slightly flexed at the knee, and that night he began to have calf and dorsal foot pain on the L side.  This lasted for ~24 hours.  He went to his PCP who was concerned that he may have compromised his graft given he had a diminished DP pulse on the L, and also had developed an area of erythema on the L lateral calf which the PCP suspected to be cellulitis.  He was prescribed keflex by his PCP which he started on 12/10, and the patient reports his erythema has improved since starting the abx.  He then revisited Dr. Atwood who found diminished trace DP pulse on the L, possibly secondary to graft kinking and/or thrombosis, and advised the patient to be admitted today for likely angiogram and possible thrombolysis in the AM.  On ROS he has had no F/C/N/V/D/abd pain/back pain.\n\nPast Medical History: \t\nDiabetes, PVD, CAD s/p PTCA ,HTN, Dyslipidemia, Urinary retention from hypotonic bladder ( self cath's) and abx prophylaxis, Former smoker, GERD, psoriasis s/p phototx \n \nPast Surgical History: \t\n    \tBilateral femoral Endarterectomies\n\tL fem-pop BPG PTFE 4/8/78 \t\n    \tSFA Angioplasty -  Dr Atwood  1/15/78  \n \tRight Fem pop BPG  with 6mm TFE Ring  2/9/78 Dr Henry Atwood \n\tLeft Shoulder surg  \n          \tCystoscopy TUR\t \n\nAllergies: \tNKDA\nMedications:  \n\tLipitor 20 qpm\nZetia 10mg qpm\nASA 81 qam\nAltace 10 qam\nAtenolol 50 qam\nGlyburide 2.5mg BID\nNitrofurantoin 50mg qd\nTaclonex 60mg cream\nKeflex 500 qid x 7 days (12/10- )\n\nPhysical Exam: T=98.5 P=72 SR  Bp=117/61 RR=  97% RA\n \nGeneral: \tWDWN NAD\nNeck: \tsupple\tCarotids:\tno bruits\nLungs: \t\tCTAB\nCV:\t\tRRR S1 S2\nAbd:\tsoft NTND +BS, no masses\tBruits: none\nPulses: \t\t\n\t\tCarotids\tL: 2+\tR: 2+\nRadial \t\tL: 2+\tR: 2+\t\n\t\tFemoral\tL: 2+\tR: 2+\n\t\tPop\t\tL: NP\tR: NP\nDP \t\tL: Dopplerable\tR: Dopplerable\n\t\tPT \t\tL: Not Dopplerable\tR: Dopplerable\t \n\t\tGrafts\t\tL: Dopplerable\tR: Dopplerable\nWound:\tL lateral thigh small 3x4 area of erythema, mildly tender, nonindurated.\n\nRecent studies:\nLabs:  \nTest Description                 Result           Flags    Ref.

M with h.o CAD and PVD s/p bilateral lower extremity bypass grafting procedures complicated by a thrombus in the L side of the iliac portion of the graft for which he has been on coumadin. In anticipation for a follow-up cardiac catheterization (recent episodes of shortness of breath), his coumadin was held since Thursday (3/6/2081). Then on 3/7/2081, he was noted by medical staff to have a slightly cool L lower extremity. The patient states that it has felt this way with some intermittent pain at rest for the last several weeks. He complained of both numbness and pain, and he was started on a heparin drip when his INR fell to less than 2.0. Dr. Atwood who did his initial operation was contacted and he was arranged for transfer to RCH.

This was complicated by a postoperative MI. 03/15/2081, cardiac catheterization \nis significant for left main and multivessel coronary artery disease, and CABG was planned.  Of note, his cath was complicated by pseudoaneurysm of the right brachial artery at the point of access.   He was evaluated by SonoSite by the cardiac surgical PA, and was found to have no available venous conduit secondary to his multiple lower extremity procedures.

She currently wears accommodative orthotics typical for somebody with her deformity.  She has noted that perhaps over the last two weeks or so that a callus has formed under the plantar lateral aspect of the left foot. She denies any drainage, erythema, or increased swelling or warmth in the foot.  Her orthotics were made in September and seem to be working quite well for her. She admits however that over the last month and half or so that she has been wearing boots that her current orthotics do not fit in. Apparently, she has had to resort to her old orthotics, which did not take her Charcot deformity into account.  \n\n\n\n\tHer past medical history is significant for diabetes mellitus and coronary artery disease. Her medications include Prograf, prednisone, Prilosec, an aspirin a day, Imdur, calcium supplement, a multi vitamin, Lantus insulin, and Humalog with meals.  She takes Imuran, Coumadin, and Toprol XL, as well as Lipitor.  Her past surgical history is significant for colostomy in 2094, fistula repair in 2095, coronary artery bypass surgery times four in 2096, a kidney transplant in 2097, and a fistula ligation in 2098.  She quit smoking ten years ago and has no known allergies to medications.\n\n\t\n\n\tPhysical examination is centered mainly around her left foot.  She has diminished sensation to ten-point examination with a Semmes-Weinstein 5.05 monofilament.  She has multiple toe amputations, all of which have healed nicely. She does have a palpable dorsalis pedis pulse.  The skin is of normal turgor. She has no active plantar ulcers on \n\nPage two\n\nRe:  Nancy Xayarath\n\nDate: February 17, 2100\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\neither foot. At the apex of her rocker bottom deformity on the left side there is a callus that I d  brided in the office underlying which is a grade 0 ulcer.  \n\n\n\n\tNo new x-rays were obtained today.\n\n\n\n\tDiagnosis: Grade 0 ulcer, diabetic left foot.\n\n\n\n\tPlan:  She has not reached the dermis on her left foot, however, should she continue to weight-bear without mechanical off-loading it is only a matter of time before this develops into a grade I ulcer.  It is unclear to me whether the culprit is an orthotic that needs to be remolded or the fact that she has been wearing boots with an inappropriate orthotic.  I am going to have her see Samantha Albright, our orthotist to have the insoles remolded with Plastizote.  I have asked Ms. Xayarath to bring the shoes that she typically wears as well as the boots she wears.  We will follow this development closely as Ms. Xayarath is perfectly aware of the potential downsides of forming an ulcer. She knows to contact me if she has any questions or concerns in the meantime. Thank you kindly for this referral.\n\n\n\nBest personal regards,\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFredrich L. van Butler, M.D.\n\n\n\nFLC/conley/MF\nRecord date: 2100-07-07\n\n\n\nHumalog 0-2/4-8/6-10\t111-64-17\n\nLantus 10 U hs\tXayarath, Nancy\n\nPrograf 2 mg bid\n\nImuran 100 mg qhs\n\nPrednisone 2.5 mg qd starting last week\n\nOmeprazole 20 mg qd\n\nLipitor 40 mg qd\n\nToprol XL 25 mg qPM\n\nImdur 30 mg qd\n\nCoumadin 4 mg tablets (for SVC stent): 4 mg 2/7; 6 mg 5/7\n\nASA 325 mg qd\n\nCaltrate with D 1200-1500 mg per day in divided doses\n\nFosamax 70 mg qw\n\nCentrum QD\n\nFolate 1 mg qd   not taking\n\nCelexa 20 mg qd\n\n\n\nJuly 07, 2100\n\n\n\nInterim History:\t\n\nComes to review her medical problems.\n\n\n\nShe had been losing weight and feeling fatigued. She has been at her current weight for several weeks and feels that she has stabilized. Appetite has been good. \n\n\n\nHome Blood Tests:  No records. She reports that she drops from the 200's to the normal range in the morning. Her bedtime test is about 3-4 hours after summer.  \n\nRetinopathy:\tSaw Dr. Xiques in the Spring. May need laser for p-cataract film. Retinas stable.\n\nNephropathy:\tCr 1.0 in September. Saw Dr. Caldwell re her Charcot foot. He put her in a boot and wheelchair for 3 weeks and it resolved well. \n\nCardiac:\tGets little tingling sensations in her anterior chest, occurring at any times. Not specifically at times of physical exercise. \n\nVascular:\tNo claudication\n\n\n\nPast Medical History: \n\nMedications: Prograf reduced.\n\n\n\nReview of Systems: \n\nGI: Feels that her abdomen is uncomfortable much of the time. Not precipitated or relieved by food. Upper and lower abdominal. No change in volume or nature of ileostomy output. She has dysphagia for liquids, sometimes with regurgitation. \n\nHad Pap and mammogram through ANC gynecologist.\n\nShe saw Dr. Wilhelm for sinus problems. He got an MRI. It showed a meningioma of the jugular foramen. Dr. Wilhelm's note indicated that she would see Dr. New for that and indeed she has seen Dr. New, although she says it is for a tumor on the vocal cord. \n\nHe also wanted her to see Dr. Carter about a vocal cord paralysis, and that visit is upcoming. \n\n\n\n\n\nPhysical Exam:\t\n\nLooks well.\n\nBP:   118/70\t\tP:   72, regular\n\nWt:   118.5 without shoes, down 8.5\n\nHEENT:\tAnicteric. \n\nCarotids:\tNormal pulses, without bruits\n\nChest:\tClear to auscultation\n\nHeart:\tDyskinetic prominent apical impulse.

No palpable AAA. \n\nExtremities:\tNo edema.       DP 2+,=.  PT absent. Prominent mound of tissue in the plantar aspect of L foot, from Charcot changes, but with very normal skin covering.  Good foot care.\n\n\n\nImpressions and Plan:\t\n\nMany active issues.\n\nHard to assess control without data. Must bring them to visits.\n\nFor now, reduce the Lantus to 8 U since she drops overnight by history.\n\nWill need to talk with Dr. Wilhelm and Dr. New about their respective perspectives and figure out who is addressing the meningioma and hydrocephalus. May need to see a neurologist. \n\nRefer to Dr. Sanders for evaluation of her gastrointestinal discomfort and dysphagia for liquids. I suspect a motility disorder.\n\nShe needs follow-up with Dr. Arndt. \n\n1 hour; most counseling and coordination of care.\n\nA1c, Electrolytes, BUN/Creatinine, CBC, anti-gliadin antibodies, anti-transglutaminase antibodies, TSH.\n\n\n\nAppointments:\t1 month\n\n\n\ncc:\tTransplant Clinic\n\n\tFredrich van Butler, M.D.\n\n\tNicole Arndt, M.D.\n\n\tLawrence Wilhelm, M.D., Minnie Hamilton Health Care Center, 727 Seneca Drive, Suite 9B,\n\n\t\t Red Springs, WA 77286\n\n\tNicholas New, M.D., BKMC\n\n\tOphelia Sanders, M.D.\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\tLawrence K.

The \npatient was seen by me approximately one month ago as a new patient and \nwhose primary medical concerns a history of coronary artery disease, for \nwhich he suffered a \"silent heart attack\" many years ago, a history of \nbenign prostatic hypertrophy, as well as hypertension and GERD.  As it \nturns out, the patient had been on Zantac for many, many years, the \nbeneficial effects of which were unknown.  We had decided as of our last \nmeeting to stop this drug and find out if he became symptomatic.  The \npatient reports today that he is not symptomatic, and thus we will \ncontinue to discontinue this medicine.  At this point, the patient does \nnot need the addition of a proton pump inhibitor, such as Prilosec.  \nWith regard to the patient's symptoms of benign prostatic hypertrophy, \nthe patient said that he only has taken one dose of the Hytrin, since he \nwanted to use up all his Minipress, which he tool up until 2 nights ago.  \nThus it is too early to assess the efficacy of this medication.  It is \nnoted that his blood pressure was 152/74, which is better than it was \nthe last time he was here, which the systolic range was 160-170 and \ndiastolic was 80-90.  The patient reports no new symptomatology other \nthan occasional fatigue, from which he will have to rest.  The patient \nhas no symptoms of congestive heart failure, no shortness of breath, no \nankle edema, no JVD by observation, and his laboratory results are \nremarkably normal, given his medical complaints.  The patient's \ncholesterol is 190 with a slightly above average triglycerides.  Review \nof systems otherwise negative.\n \nPhysical exam is not performed at this time.  Blood pressure was 152/76 \non the right, 152/76 on the left, temperature was 96.8, respirations 20 \nand unlabored, and pulse was 70.\n \nASSESSMENT/PLAN: This is a 75 year old man with multiple medical \nproblems coming in for follow-up.\n1.   Hypertension - the patient will stay on his Zestril and will use \n     Hytrin now, both for his hypertension, as well as benign prostatic \n     hypertrophy.  The patient does speak of some nocturnal dribbling, \n     and he said he also has urge incontinence, particularly while \n     standing.  The patient was told that after a trial of Hytrin, which \n     hopefully can help with his symptoms of benign prostatic \n     hypertrophy, that this urge incontinency will also be helped.  If \n     the patient's symptoms continue beyond this, he will be referred to \n     Urology for possible TUNA procedure.\n \n2.   BPH - please see above.  The patient will stay on Hytrin for now.\n \n3.   ? coronary artery disease - the patient's cholesterol is 190 with a \n     slightly above average triglycerides, which is more than acceptable \n     for this gentleman.  I do not have an HDL in which to judge his \n     ratio, but I was by the patient before that it runs in the high 40s \n     MARTHA JEFFERSON HOSPITAL\nStephen A.N.

Therefore this will be an acceptable ratio without \n     therapy.  I will get a fasting lipid on the patient probably in \n     about 6 months, and if there is any derangement in his profile, he \n     will be put on an antilipid drug.\n \n4.   GI - at this point his GERD symptoms have not returned, and what I \n     will attempt to do is to keep him off his H2 blockers at this \n     point.  Should his symptoms return, the patient most likely will be \n     placed on Prilosec.\n \nI will seen him in one month for follow-up, primarily for evaluation of \nhis use of Hytrin.\n \n \n______________________________\nStephen A.N.

The patient \nis seen primarily for follow up regarding his history of hypertension, \ncoronary artery disease (the patient is status post inferior wall MI), \nbenign prostatic hypertrophy and to a much lesser extent osteoarthritis.  \nThe patient is also followed GERD-like symptoms.  With regard to the \nlatter, the patient notes that since he has been off the Zantac, he \ninitially saw no change in his ability to handle foods; however, he now \nnotes that he is starting to get some reflux and feels slightly \nuncomfortable with this.  He denies chest pain per se and any symptoms \npertinent to cardiovascular disease, such as chest heaviness, shortness \nof breath, diaphoresis, nausea.  The patient knows the foods that give \nhim this type of reaction, such as tomato based sauces and tries to \navoid them as much as possible.  The patient is asking me about Prilosec \nwhich he recently read in the Journal and was wandering whether this \nwould be a suitable alternative to H2 blockers (Patient had been on H2 \nblockers for many years without a trial off of them, which a reason that \nwe stopped his H2 blocker therapy recently).  \n \nWith regard to the patient's symptoms of benign prostatic hypertrophy, \nthe patient says that these have almost completely resolved on the 4 mg \nof Hytrin and which he will continue taking.  The patient does remain on \nZestril for his hypertension as well as the Hytrin and the blood \npressure gotten by the nurse today was 150/80 and repeated by me 20 \nminutes later was 130/74. \n \nThe patient reports being otherwise well, no new symptoms.  No positive \nreview of systems.  \n \nPHYSICAL EXAM:  Was not performed.  Vitals:  Blood pressure taken by me \nwas 130/74 in the right, 130/74 in the left, temperature was 98.8, \nrespirations 20, unlabored and pulse was 80.  \n \nASSESSMENT AND PLAN:  75 year old man with multiple medical concerns \ncomes in for follow up.\n1.   Hypertension.  The patient will stay on his Zestril, once a day as \n     well as his Hytrin, which he uses also for BPH.  His blood pressure \n     appears to be well controlled on this regimen.  One of the issues \n     would be whether or not the patient should be on a beta-blocker.  \n     The patient verbally has a history of \"a silent heart attack\"  and \n     there is evidence of an inferior wall MI and this is certainly an \n     option we will consider in the future, although I would not add a \n     third anti-hypertensive regimen and would most likely replace his \n     Zestril with a beta-blocker.\n2.   GERD.  The patient will be given a prescription for Prilosec 20 mg \n     to be taken at bedtime.  The patient was told that this would not \n     MARTHA JEFFERSON HOSPITAL\nStephen A.N.

The patient does have a known hiatal hernia, which \n     may also contribute to his symptoms of chronic reflux.\n3.   BPH - The patient will stay on his 4 mg of Hytrin, which appears to \n     be working quite well.  The patient notes that there is less \n     dribbling, less nocturnal urination.  The patient does take Lasix \n     20 mg once a day for congestive heart failure and did not have any \n     difficulty with urination after he takes the diuretic.  \n4.   Insomnia.  The patient will stay on his Ambien 10 mg which he takes \n     on a q.h.s. basis.  The patient was formerly on Amitriptyline but \n     was told that the secondary side effects which can include EKG \n     changes and at this point tells me that the Ambien works and he \n     would like to stay on this.  Patient has enough to last until I see \n     him next time.\n \nI will thus see the patient in 3 months for a fasting lipid (The \npatient's lipid profile thus far has been acceptable.   The cholesterol \nis 190 and an acceptable triglyceride; however, I do want to assess the \npatient's LDL and HDL before making any decisions with regard to \ntreatment.  \n \n \n \n______________________________\nStephen A.N.

He is status post TURP by Dr. \nNixon.  He is having a little bit of incontinence, but Dr. Nixon \nthinks that this should get better.\n \nWe will have to recheck his platelets, which have been in the 120 to 145 \nrange.  We also will look back at his echocardiogram, which is showing \nthat he had slight mitral and tricuspid regurgitation as well as mildly \ndilated LV with inferior hypokinesis.  He has remained on digoxin status \npost his myocardial infarction.\n \nWe want to recheck his cholesterol today.  We also have been concerned \nthat he has been a little depressed but mostly because he is concerned \nabout his wife's situation with breast cancer.  We had a long discussion \nabout this.\n \nPhysical Examination:  On physical examination, his weight is 250 lbs.  \nHis blood pressure was 178/80.  The follow-up was 170/80.  His neck was \nsupple.  Chest was clear to both percussion and auscultation.  Cardiac \nexam was regularly regular with no murmurs, gallops or rubs.  Abdomen \nwas soft and nontender with no hepatosplenomegaly.  Extremities were \nclear of cyanosis, clubbing or edema.  Rectal tone was normal and guaiac \nnegative.\n \nLaboratory Data:  His hematocrit was 39.9.  Platelets were within normal \nlimits.  White count is 8.3.  Digoxin is 0.9.  Lytes are within normal \nlimits.  \n \nAssessment and Plan:\n1.   Status post TURP.  He appears to be recovering well.  He has had \n     slight incontinence, but I suspect this will pass.\n2.   Thrombocytopenia.  This was very relative.  It now appears to have \n     resolved.\n3.   Coronary artery disease.  As he recovers from his TURP, I question \n     whether it might be reasonable to go ahead and reexercise him.  At \n     the present time, he is quite stable on an aspirin, digoxin and \n     Lasix.  However, it may be that he would benefit from further \n     treatment with anti-anginals.\n4.   Hypercholesterolemia.  This has been well-controlled recently.  His \n     last cholesterol was 168 in August of 2093.\n5.   Depression.  He continues on Ambien.  He has some discretion about \n     his wife's breast cancer, and he appears to have some of his \n     uncertainty resolved.    \n \n_________________________\nMiles Echeverria, M.D.                                                      \n \nGH:VO:0860/DD:12-18-93/DT:12-20-93/DV:12-18-93                          \n ******** Not reviewed by Attending Physician ********\nRecord date: 2094-06-12\n\nJune 12, 2094\n \n \nMiles Echeverria, M.D.\nSpencer Internal Medicine Associates\nSpencer State Hospital\n16 Burrit St\nFayetteville, MI  31474\n \nRE:  Vicente, Kadeem F.\n     MRN: 948-59-58-0\n \nDear Miles:\n \nI had the pleasure of seeing Mr. Vicente in Cardiovascular Care today.  This lovely 77-year old man has had past medical\nhistory notable for coronary artery disease, hypertension, benign\nprostatic hypertrophy, depression, insomnia, osteoarthritis status\npost total knee replacement.\n \nHe presents today because of a recent exacerbation of symptomatic\ncoronary artery disease.  His history of coronary artery disease\nbegins with his presentation following his total knee replacement\nin June of 2091.  In 10/91 he had an episode of profound weakness\nand sat down.  He had no clear substernal chest pressure, loss of\nconsciousness or edema.  Workup at that time included a thallium\ntest which did not clearly demonstrate ischemia and an\nechocardiogram with an ejection fraction of 50%.  He began therapy\nat that point in time with aspirin, niacin, vitamin E, Lasix,\nZestril, Zantac, Minipress, Amitriptyline, and Digoxin.  He had\nbeen free of exertional neck, chest, arm and jaw pain, paroxysmal\nnocturnal dyspnea, orthopnea, palpitations, claudication and TIA\nuntil this past spring.  He actually had done very well with risk\nfactor reduction including completing cardiac rehab at MJH and\nfollowing a stringent weight reduction program and decreasing his\nweight.  In March of 2094 he began noticing that when he was going\nup the 19 steps in his house he began having mid-sternal chest\ndiscomfort and some dyspnea at the top of the stairs.  He stopped\nworking with the physiotherapist at that point and was initiated on\nnitrate therapy.  Since that time he has noted that he has had\nsignificant decrease in symptoms and over the past week has\nactually had no need to take sublingual nitroglycerine and has been\ntaking the full flight of stairs without difficulty.  He does note\nfatigue and insomnia such that he is sleeping only 2 to 3 hours a\nnight.  He does continue to be free of paroxysmal nocturnal\ndyspnea, orthopnea, palpitations or lightheadedness.\n \nMedical regimen includes Ambien, Paxil, Isordil 20 t.i.d.,\nAtenolol, Digoxin, Zantac and aspirin.  He has no known drug\nallergies.\n \nOn physical exam blood pressure when he first arrived at Clinic was\nnoted to be 220/100.  At the present time it is 180/100 with a\nVicente, Kadeem F.\nMRN: 948-59-58-0\nJune 12, 2094\nPage Two\n \nheart rate of 55 and a respiratory rate of 10.  There is no\nincrease in jugular venous pressure.  His carotids are free of\nbruits.  His lungs are entirely clear to auscultation throughout,\nand cardiac exam is notable for a non-displaced PMI, S1 and\nphysiologically-split S2 with no murmur, rub or gallop.  Abdominal\nexam is notable for a ventral hernia.  There is no organomegaly and\nneither are there bruits present.  Lower extremities are notable\nfor 2+ femoral, popliteal, dorsalis pedis and posterior tibial\npulses with no edema.  Skin exam is notable only for the senile\nangioma.\n \nElectrocardiogram is notable for a left bundle branch block which\nis new since prior tracing available here of 4/03/94.  MIBI was\nnotable only for a potential fixed anteroseptal defect and no\nsignificant ischemia on 5/6/94.  The ejection fraction on a gated\nspect was 57%.  \n \nIn summary, it appears that Mr. Vicente may have experienced a new\nmyocardial infarction resulting in a left bundle branch block in\nMarch of 2094.  He could, however, also have developed his\nprogressive conduction system disease and have the fixed defect on\nhis MIBI attributable only to a left bundle branch block.  I will\nbe reviewing the primary images to make my final decision.  In\neither regard he is now free of symptoms on his current medical\nregimen despite his increased weight and his increased blood\npressure.  I certainly agree with further assistance from nutrition\nand weight loss and proceeding with Imdur therapy which I would\nincrease to 60 mg p.o. q.d.  I also would consider further decrease\nof his LDL with statin therapy but would only consider this after\nassessing his response to re-initiation his nutrition program. \nGiven his lack of symptoms at the present time with his usual daily\nactivity, I would prefer to proceed on the medical therapy route. \nI think that he could be reintroduced to rehab at MJH with the\nhopes that further education can get him back on line in terms of\nrisk factor reduction.  \n \nI certainly look forward to discussing this case further with you. \nIt's certainly a pleasure to participate in his care.\n \nSincerely,\n \n \n \nGwen K.

He finally took nitroglycerin \n\ntablets at about 9 or 10:00 a.m. and this abated his chest \n\ndiscomfort.  The patient has known history of coronary artery \n\ndisease and recently had gone back on his coronary rehab program, \n\nhowever, yesterday after a workout, he became extremely tired, more \n\ntire than usual.  He thought he might have pushed it a bit and he \n\nrested throughout the rest of the day.  Then last night, he had \n\nsome chest discomfort, which he initially did not think much of. \n\nThen was then associated with some shortness of breath in the early \n\nmorning hours.  He felt he was wheezing.  This resolved after he \n\ngot up and walked around.  He took the nitroglycerin tablets this \n\nmorning.  These were fresh nitroglycerin tablets he had just \n\nobtained and this, in fact, resolved his symptoms.  He then came in \n\nto see Dr. Echeverria, his physician, in clinic and was sent to the \n\nemergency department for evaluation.  Please see the handwritten \n\nemergency department record for additional details. \n\nPAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Coronary artery disease \n\nSOCIAL HISTORY AND FAMILY HISTORY:  See handwritten emergency \n\ndepartment record. \n\nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  The patient is presently comfortable, not \n\ntachypneic.  His blood pressure is 160/80.  His heart rate is in \n\nthe 50s.  There is no evidence of congestive heart failure on \n\nexamination.  There is no jugular venous distention and his lungs \n\nare clear to auscultation.  His heart examination is distant, with \n\nno murmurs or gallops appreciated.  His extremities have trace \n\nedema.  Abdomen in soft and non-tender.  Pulses are equal. \n\nLABORATORY EVALUATION:  His electrocardiogram shows a left bundle \n\nbranch pattern with no change in configuration from previous \n\ntracings.  His other laboratory studies are pending. \n\nTHERAPY RENDERED/COURSE IN ED:  The case was discussed with his \n\nphysician, Dr. Echeverria.  We both agree that the patient has \n\nprobably had a progression of his coronary syndrome with possible \n\nunstable plaque, given his episode of shortness of breath and \n\nparoxysmal nocturnal dyspnea.  It is possible that he has silent \n\nischemia, which is not evident because of the left bundle branch \n\npattern.  Pending the other evaluation and studies, which are being \n\nsent at this time, the patient will require hospitalization for \n\nfurther medical management. \n\nFINAL DIAGNOSIS:  Acute coronary insufficiency, coronary artery \n\ndisease. \n\nDISPOSITION (including condition upon discharge):  The patient was \n\nadmitted to the hospital in stable condition. \n\n___________________________________                    BR445/05178 \n\nSTEPHEN HENDERSON, M.D.   SH44                             D:09/30/95 \n\n                                                       T:09/30/95 \n\nDictated by:  STEPHEN HENDERSON, M.D.   SH44 \n\n ******** Not reviewed by Attending Physician ********"}

She did not apply any pressure.  She states \nthat she was bleeding through the night, did not want to bother her \nbrother, called Dr. Aponte today who told her to come in.  She \nstates that she did not know where the site was.  She could not see \nit and she did not apply pressure.  She has no chest pain, no \nshortness of breath.  She is not dizzy.  She is on Lovenox and \nCoumadin both.  She has not had her PT checked.  The rest of the \nsystems were reviewed and are negative. \nPAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Depression, cardiac cath, hypothyroidism. \nMEDICATIONS:  Taken from the chart. \nALLERGIES:  Taken from the chart. \nSOCIAL HISTORY:  She lives with her brother. \nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Her heart rate was 81, her temperature is \n96.5 degrees, blood pressure is 123/64.  This is a well-developed \nfemale, alert, oriented.  HEENT exam is atraumatic, normocephalic. \nNeck is soft and supple.  Mouth and throat are normal. \nWell-hydrated moist mucosa.  Conjunctiva are clear.  Sclerae are \nnon-icteric.  There is no jugular venous distention.  Heart had a \nregular rate and rhythm.  The lungs were clear to auscultation \nbilaterally.  The abdomen was soft, nontender.  No guarding.  No \nhepatosplenomegaly.  There is a hematoma at the right groin.  The \ncath site was about 1 cm and closed but there was some small oozing \nfrom the site.  It stopped with pressure.  The patient was covered \nin blood and blood clots.  The old dressing was removed.  All the \ndried blood and blood clots were removed.  The patient was cleaned \nup by myself.  Then, the nurses put her in the hospital gown. \nLABORATORY EVALUATION:  PT, PTT, CBC were obtained. \nTHERAPY RENDERED/COURSE IN ED:  After speaking with the patient at \nlength, it seems that she lives with her older brother.  She is \ncaring for him and is a bit overwhelmed with this.  Obviously, her \nmedical knowledge base is not adequately prepared to deal with this \nproblem.  She will be admitted to the Observation Area through the \nday for nurse training.  Social Services will be consulted to \narrange for a home visiting nurse.  Dr. Aponte was called. \nCONSULTATIONS (including PCP):  Social Services and Dr. Aponte. \nFINAL DIAGNOSIS:  Bleeding from cath site and knowledge deficit. \nDISPOSITION (including condition upon discharge):  See the chart \nfor disposition. \n___________________________________                    OO412/09605 \nNATHAN PLATT, M.D.       NP27                           D:01/15/61 \n                                                       T:01/15/61 \nDictated by:  NATHAN PLATT, M.D.       NP27 \ncc:  OWEN R.

Of note, a recent stress test at DCGH had shown LBBB but nl LV function, so she was diagnosed with new cardiomyopathy.  She was disch on 9/10 to Dr. Qu's care.

She also has had hypertension and elevated lipids \n\nover approximately the same period of time.  She has a complicated history \n\nincluding lung cancer and colon cancer, both treated and in remission.  Her \n\ncreatinine has been rising gradually over recent years with a value of 1.0 in 2062, \n\n1.2 in May 2063, 2.1 and 1.8 in early 2064 with 2.3 in May 2064, and recently 3.1 \n\nobtained on July 06, 2064.\n\n\n\nShe has been quite anemic in the recent months with a hematocrit level of 24.9.  \n\nHer serum folate, B12, and iron and are not particularly low, and MCV is normal \n\nat 81.  Urinalysis showed 3+ albumin in September 2062 and persisting \n\nproteinuria since that time.  Dr. Yeomans obtained an ultrasound examination in \n\nMarch, which showed diffusely thinned renal cortices, but no evidence of \n\nobstruction, stones, or masses.\n\n\n\nShe has visited an ophthalmologist regularly for macular degeneration.  She does \n\nnot know whether signs of diabetes are present, but she has had no laser treatment \n\nfor any proliferative retinopathy.\n\n\n\nRecently, she has been feeling unusually fatigued with diminished appetite and \n\nalmost constant nausea.  She vomits rarely.  Her weight has fallen by about 20 \n\npounds.  She is slightly constipated.  She is moderately dyspneic on exertion.  She \n\nis not troubled by muscle cramps or by unusual itching of her skin.\n\n\n\nHer medications continue as listed with ACE inhibitors, \"statins,\" and a rather \n\nlarge dose of Lasix at 80 mg twice a day.\n\n\n\nMedications\n\nPaxil 20.0 MG PO 1 TAB QD\n\nSynthroid 0.05 MG PO 1 TAB QD\n\nMultivitamins 1 TAB QD\n\nOne Touch Test Strips : As directed.\n\nLORAZEPAM 0.5 MG PO 1 TAB QD\n\nAccupril (QUINAPRIL) 10 MG PO 1 TAB QD\n\nCalcium Gluconate 500MG, 2 Tablet(s) PO BID\n\nSerevent (SALMETEROL) 2 PUFFS NAS BID\n\nAtrovent Inhaler (IPRATROPIUM Inhaler) 2 PUFFS NAS BID\n\nEcasa (ASPIRIN Enteric Coated) 81MG, 1 Tablet(s) PO 1 TAQD\n\nLasix (FUROSEMIDE) 80MG, 2 Tablet(s) PO BID\n\nLopressor (METOPROLOL Tartrate) 50MG, 0.5 Tablet(s) PO BID\n\nFe Gluconate (FERROUS Gluconate) 325MG, 1 Tablet(s) PO TID\n\nGlucophage (METFORMIN) 500MG, 2 Tablet(s) PO : 2 tabs po qam, 2 tabs po qpm.\n\nCaltrate 600 1 TAB PO BID\n\nAvandia (ROSIGLITAZONE) 4MG, 1 Tablet(s) PO BID\n\nOcuvite (MULTIVITAMINS) 1 TAB PO QD\n\nFosamax (ALENDRONATE) 70MG, 1 Tablet(s) PO QWEEK\n\nPrilosec (OMEPRAZOLE) 20MG, 1 Capsule(s) PO BID\n\nLipitor 40 MG PO 1 TAB QD \n\n\n\n\n\nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  On examination today, she looks tired but \n\nreasonably comfortable.  She speaks in a high-pitched somewhat hoarse voice, \n\nwhich has persisted since one of her surgical procedures.  Her blood pressure in \n\nthe right arm, sitting, is 148/60 with regular pulse 72.  Her chest has a few basal \n\ncrackles but in general is clear and air moves comfortably.  JVP fills below the \n\nsternal angle heart shows a grade 2 systolic murmur, loudest at the upper left \n\nsternal border.  Abdomen is soft and nontender.  There is no renal tenderness.  \n\nExtremities have no edema.\n\n\n\nIMPRESSION:  Progressive renal failure in a 74-year-old woman with more than \n\n10 years' history of diabetes as well has hypertension and hyperlipidemia.  The \n\nproteinuria, if confirmed, would support the diagnosis of diabetic nephropathy but \n\nthis would be unusual in the absence of retinopathy.  It would be useful to know \n\nfrom her ophthalmologist whether retinopathy is present.  It is, of course, also \n\npossible that she has vascular disease involving the kidneys.  Their symmetry and \n\nthe presence of proteinuria would argue against this possibility.  The ACE \n\ninhibitor in the presence of vascular disease might of course raise her serum \n\ncreatinine by reducing renal blood flow somewhat.  Her loss of appetite and \n\nnausea may well be related to the degree of renal failure.\n\n\n\nRECOMMENDATION:  I would suggest that she see Filomena Xia, RD, a renal \n\ndietitian, to learn a diet appropriate for renal failure as well as for her diabetes and \n\nhyperlipidemia.  This might succeed in reducing some of her nausea.  It think it \n\nwould be worthwhile as an experiment to reduce or discontinue her Accupril and \n\nperhaps  her Lasix temporarily to see whether serum creatinine falls with \n\nless ACE inhibition and somewhat more fluid volume.  If, of course, shortness of \n\nbreath worsens or edema appears, then returning to the Lasix would be \n\nreasonable.  It might be that a longer acting, milder diuretic, such as 5 mg of \n\nmetolazone might help to control edema (and potassium) and reduce the \n\nrequirement for Lasix.  If serum creatinine fell appreciably with less ACE and \n\ndiuresis, it would reassure us that the damage was not all structural, and it might \n\nbe then possible to return to these medicines with less worry.\n\n\n\nHer anemia is no doubt related to lack of erythropoietin and would likely benefit \n\nfrom instituting therapy with Epogen (such as 4000 units twice a week) or \n\nAranesp).\n\n\n\nPLAN:  We will send a urine today for total protein to creatinine ratio, which may \n\nhelp us decide whether the problem is mainly diabetic nephropathy.  If so, the \n\nmeasures proposed would be appropriate.  We discussed the eventual probable \n\nneed for dialysis (assuming no other intercurrent medical catastrophes).  It would \n\nbe useful for her to visit the DCGH Renal Department (located here on our \n\nfloor at 592G, along with Ms. Xia's office) to learn about modes of dialysis.  \n\nWe discussed construction of a forearm fistula, which should be done well before \n\na need for it arises.  I would, in fact, recommend that she proceed to have this \n\ndone in the next few months.  This could be arranged through Dr. Xaysana's office \n\nor perhaps by speaking with Dr. Najee Yuan.  I will, of course, help with any of \n\nthese measures as necessary.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nXander Xie, M.D.\n\n\n\n\n\nWanda\n\nUrine total protein/creatinine ratio is only 0.11 (corresponding to about 0.1 g/day or proteinuria).  This is a very small amount for diabetic nephropathy, and argues in favor of vascular disease.  I would suggest getting a MRA of renal arteries to look for any main artery obstruction.  If present it would account for the sensitivity of her creatinine to ACE or changes in hydration.\n\n\n\nKyle\nRecord date: 2064-08-11\n\nDCGH Cancer Center\n\n\n\nDiagnosis:  \n\n1.

Mr. Wood was at work this morning and at 9 AM he started to feel weak.  He describes the weakness as lack of energy and has normal muscle strength.  He states he really didn't have any symptoms other than weakness, but when asked about chest pain, he notes that he had mild chest discomfort, which was analogous to catching his breath after exercise.  He also describes some mild lightheadedness.  He has 2 pillow orthopnea, but he denies any fever, chills, nausea, night sweats, unintentional weight loss, syncope, HA, dyspnea, chest pain, PND, diaphoresis, palpitations, or any other concerning symptoms.  He notes his last BM was on Friday morning and states his stools have not been black or tarry, bright red, pencil thin, or watery.  He denies any abdominal pain, constipation, or diarrhea.  He notes that rest and staying out of the heat improved his symptoms, while exertion worsened his symptoms.  He has had these symptoms before in March of this year, but his symptoms today are more mild than when he presented then.  At that time he had symptoms of weakness and lightheadedness especially when standing, and he was found to have a Hct of 24.9.  He was guiac positive and was sent for a colonoscopy and an upper GI endoscopy, where a he was found to have erosive esophagitis and two cecal polyps.  The bowel prep on the colonoscopy was poor and he was asked to follow up with a repeat colonoscopy.  He was sent home on iron supplements and a PPI.  Of note, his previous colonoscopies had shown tubulovillous adenomas including a 25 mm polyp that could not be fully resected and had been   Before this admission he was seen by his worksite nurse who sent him to his PCP.  Dr. David Napolitano at Kessel Group Home saw him and transferred him to SMI for workup of severe anemia (Hct 25.4 MCV 75), dizziness, and orthostasis. \n\n    \n\nPMH:\n\n\n\n1.\tDiverticulosis (Dx by colonoscopy in 10/18/87\n\n2.\tPolyps - Single polyp 10/87 removed by colonoscopy (tubulovillous adenoma) with 11 day postpolypectomy bleed.

His Hct stabilized at 26 since his transfer from his PCP's office.  His anemia is most likely due to lower GI bleeding from either his diverticulosis or from his polyposis given his guiac positive stool in the ER.  He is currently hemodynamically stable and he states he feels much better symptomatically.  Given that he hasn't had a follow up colonoscopy since the poorly prepped one in March of this year, he will probably need to be reevaluated by Dr. Narvaez.  Other possible attributing causes of his anemia could be hypothyroidism given his somewhat delayed response, but his DTR were normal.  Iron studies will be sent to confirm the probable diagnosis of chronic GI bleeding resulting in iron deficiency anemia.  He will not be transfused now given that he is asymptomatic currently and he prefers not to be transfused unless necessary.  His syncope could also have been exacerbated from his slight orthostatic hypotension as seen on PE and his high Cre and BUN indicating that he is volume depleted.  He will be adequately hydrated to correct his hypotension.  Given his chest pain and syncope, MI will be ruled out, but this is very unlikely given his clinical presentation.  His first enzymes were negative and his EKG showed no Q waves or ST changes.   \n\n\n\nPlan: \n\n1)\tGI Bleed\n\na.\tTransfuse pRBCs if necessary - Consent and Type and Cross (O +)\n\nb.\tTwo large bore IVs if rapid resuscitation is needed\n\nc.\tFollow Hct Q8H and watch HR and BP for signs of active bleeding\n\nd.\tNexium 40 POQD\n\n2)\tHeme:  Anemia\n\na.\tSend Iron Studies, TSH\n\nb.\tFeSO4 325 mg POTID\n\n3)\tCV:  \n\na.\tRule out MI:  Enzymes + Monitor\n\nb.\tHypertensive:  Continue on HCTZ and Zestril\n\nc.\tHyperlipidemia:  Continue Lipitor\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n_________________________________\n\nDavid Napolitano, MS IV\n\nPager #57255\nRecord date: 2092-08-16\n\n \n\nEye Specialties Intern Admission H & P\n\n\n\nPatient Name: Wood, Cade\n\nMR# 6691247\n\nLocation: BIG99\n\nPCP:\t Dr. Otto Suzanne\n\n\n\nDate of Admission: 8/15/92\n\n\n\nID/CC:\t59 y.o. male with SOB during a CT on the day of admission\n\nHPI:  Pt. is a 59 y.o. male with DLBCL dx'ed with stage 4 DLBCL in 11/07, S/P CHOP-R (finished 3/08), HTN, GERD, and anemia who p/w acute onset of SOB while lying down during a f/u staging non-contrast CT on the day of admission.

He showed no signs of volume overload during the physical exam. Chest CT showed no acute hemorrhage, PTX, or lymphangitic spread (preliminary read). Follow-up official CT read. No contrast was given, therefore, acute SOB could not be secondary to contrast allergy. This pt.'s salty diet and uncontrolled HTN most likely led to the acute decompensation. No evidence of infection. Pt. will receive an Echo to evaluate for possible worsening LVEF s/p antrhacycline chemo vs. diastolic dysfunction with LV hypertrophy. F/U BNP. Will re-dose lasix only if necessitated by clinical signs of volume overload.\n\nAngina - This pt. has EKG changes and pain that is possibly cardiogenic in origin. Will obtain serial enzymes to r/o MI. Begin ASA, increase lopressor to 50 TID, captopril instead of lisinopril for easier titration of BPs, 2LO2 via nasal canula. Consider stress test before d/c.\n\nProphylaxis - fragmin 5000 SC QD. SOB resolved after lasix + lopressor. Unlikely PE in this setting but pt. is hypercoagulable given malignancy. Low threshold for CT PE protocol.\n\nGERD-Omeprazole.\n\nOnc - Will check uric acid and LDH to eval. for possible TLS. Unlikely given normal electrolytes and good renal function. CT shows no lymphangitic spread but must f/u official read in the AM.\n\n\n\n_________________________________\n\nHenderson Xin, MD\n\nTeam 3 Intern\n\nDepartment of Internal Medicine\n\nSaint Marys Infirmary\n\nPager #44348\nRecord date: 2093-07-10\n\n\n\nKaur, Xan G\n\nInternal Medicine, Buite N\n\nVictor Cullen State Hospital, 4th Hloor , Aoom 498\n\nCortland, IL, 75166-9513\n\n\n\n\t\tRE: CADE  WOOD\n\n07/10/2093\n\nAdmission Note\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\nBIGELOW U INTERN ADMISSION NOTE\n\n\n\nPATIENT: WOOD, CADE\n\nMRN: 6691247\n\nATTENDING: WEISS\n\nPCP: OTTO, SUZANNE\n\nCODE: FULL\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\n\nCC: Testicular pain \n\n\n\nHPI:  60 yo male with a 5 day history of sharp testicular pain, increased frequency that would awake him 5-6 times a night, and burning on urination.

Contributors may be Cyclosporine toxicity and intermittent dehydration. However, the recent more rapid rise makes biphosphonate toxicity or HCV-associated renal disease a worthy consideration. Bobbie also has uncontrolled hypertension and anemia.\n\n\n\nI took the liberty to order a 24-hour urine collection, a kidney US, as well as SPEP, UPEP, cryoglobulin level, Fe-studies. Norvasc 5mg PO qd was also returned to his regiment. For now, I suggest to hold further infusions of Parmidronate until more data is available.\n\n\n\nBobbie will have a blood pressure check in 2 weeks (when he is in Nappanee for another appointment), and I will see him in four weeks. At that point he will be evaluated for Epogen/Aranesp.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThomas Yockey, MD. \n\nRenal Fellow\n\n(for Dr. Yousef Pugh)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCC: Dr Benjamin Earnest\nRecord date: 2077-02-01\n\n             \t\t\t\t\n\n Critical care\t\t\t\t\t \n\n\n\n\n\nTRANSPLANT FELLOW ADMIT NOTE\n\n\n\n\n\nHPI: 42 year old man s/p bilateral lung transplantation for bronchiectasis in 7/73 transferred from Burlington Obstetrics Gynecology Center for further evaluation of N/V/D, fever and hypoxia.  Over the past six weeks he had reported a slow decline in respiratory function  prompting a recent admission here 1/23 -25/77 for elective bronchoscopy to rule out rejection.  He noted a slight spontaneous improvement a few days before that admission.  Bronchoscopy showed no rejection but washings did grow M. catarrhalis -levaquin was begun on 1/25/77.  Pt reports continued slow improvement in dyspnea following discharge.  Yesterday morning he developed watery diarrhea (no blood or mucus) soon followed by nausea and vomiting (no blood or coffee grounds).  He went to BOGC and describes feeling increased dyspnea.  Found to be febrile to 101F and hypoxic (SpO2 94%, PaO2 53) and started on supplemental oxygen.  GI symptoms have since improved and pt is tolerating PO.  Denies chest pain, palpitations, cough, rash, HA, rhinorrhea, sore throat at any point during this illness.  Currently no dyspnea at rest.  \n\n\n\nPMH: OSA, obesity, osteoporosis, gout, HTN, CRI, avascular necrosis of R hip/knee, depression, psoriasis\n\n\n\nCurrent Meds: \n\nImm: neoral 125 mg po bid, cellcept 500 mg po bid, prednisone 30 mg po qd\n\nAbx: levaquin 500 mg po qd (1/25), bactrim ss 1 po tiw, acyclovir 200 mg po tid\n\nOther: atenolol 25 mg po qd, norvasc 5 mg po qd, nexium 20 mg po qd, MgGlu 500 mg po tid, Kdur 20 mEq po qd, lipitor 40 mg po qd, Ca citrate/vit D/MVI, lasix 40 mg po qd, cozaar 100 mg po qd\n\n\n\nSH: Lives in Florida with wife.

Now afebrile and with resolution of GI symptoms.  Remains somewhat dyspneic with normal BP and HR.  Azotemia possibly attributable to dehydration though concern for other etiologies as per Dr. Reilly's note.  WBCs reduced from recent levels.\n\n\n\nRecommendations: \n\nGI illness: Mostly asymptomatic now though some concerning abnormalities remain (O2 requirement, low plt, low WBC, high Cr).  Remains hemodynamically stable.  Await results of panculture including stool studies (including C diff, E coli, Camphylobacter) when available.  \n\nTransplant: Continue current immunosuppression and prophylactic abx.  Will consider holding cellcept, valcyte if leukopenia persists/worsens.  Follow daily cyclosporin troughs.  No evidence of rejection on recent biopsy.\n\nDyspnea: Consider aspiration though CXR negative, will follow.  Hold abx for now.\n\nRenal: Azotemia of unclear etiology, follow up labs pending.  Renal consult per Dr. Reilly.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n___________________\n\nOscar B.

Pt. was in USOH until about 3 weeks ago when he first noted a sore throat.  He had a sick contact at work.  Pt. saw his PCP, who prescribed 10 days of Levaquin.  Although the sore throat resolved after about one week, pt. developed a cough producing yellowish sputum and chest congestion.  Pt. called his pulmonologist   s office (Dr. Earnest) and was advised to have a sputum sample sent to a lab in Florida, where pt. lives.  He was also advised to complete his Levaquin course, which ended on 5/10.  Despite completing levaquin course, cough, congestion, and mild DOE (occasionally had to increase home O2 from 2L to 3L) persisted.  He noted a temperature to 100 on 5/8, no chills, no chest pain.  Pt. again called Dr. Earnest, who ordered chest CT, PFTs, and obtain sputum culture results from lab in Florida, which revealed a pathogen resistant to cipro (did not test susceptibility to levoflox) and susceptible to zosyn and cefepime.  Pt. is admitted for IV antibiotics.\n\nROS: \nNegative in detail, including no recent unintentional weight changes, HA, neck pain/stiffness, change in vision, palpitations, abd pain, N/V/D/C, blood in stool, dysuria, hematuria, joint/muscle pain, numbness, or weakness.\n\nPMH:\nS/p double lung transplant (7/73) for bronchiectasis\nHypertension\nCKD (baseline Cr 1.8-2.4)\nOSA\nObesity\nOsteoporosis\nAvascular necrosis of R hip/knee\nDepression\nPsoriasis\n\nMeds on Admit: \nacyclovir  200mg po TID\nalbuterol inhaler  90mcg/spray inh q4-6h PRN\nAlbuterol Nebulizer  3ml (0.083%) neb q4h PRN\nazithromycin  250mg tab po MWF\nBactrim  single strength 1 tab po MWF\ncalcium citrate  600 mg po bid\nCellcept  500mg po bid\ncolistin  150 mg inhaled qd\nCozaar  100mg po qd\ndoxycycline  100mg po bid\nLasix  40 mg po qd\nLipitor  40mg po qd\nmagnesium gluconate  1000mg po tid\nmultivitamins  1 tab po qd\nNexium  20mg po qd\nNorvasc  5 mg po qd\npamidronate  60mg iv q 6 months\npotassium chloride  20mEq po bid\nprednisone  15mg po qd\nPrograf  1mg 6 caps po bid\nReglan  5mg po qac, qhs\nToprol XL  50 mg po qd\nvitamin d  50,000 IU po q week\n\nAllergies:\nNKDA\n\nFamily Hx: \nBreast cancer- relatives\n\nSocial Hx:\nLives in Florida w/ wife.

He was seen in the post-transplant clinic on 10/29/2079 with complaints of worsening dyspnea on exertion over the preceding two weeks to the point that he has been symptomatic with ADLs and after walking 4-5 steps. He says that his prednisone dose was decreased from 12.5 to 10 mg daily approximately 1 month ago and that his tacrolimus dose had been decreased earlier this year. At baseline, he is on supplemental oxygen (2L NC at rest and 4L NC with exertion). He denied F/C/cough/chest pain/jaw or L arm pain/sick contacts. Recently had a treadmill ETT and TTE in Florida. Also some morning headaches for the past 5 days. Denies vision change, sinus pain or drainage. No recent leg pain/swelling or prolonged travel. No recent travel outside of Fountain Of The Four Rivers area. Has a puppy at home; no other recent animal contact. No recent falls.

Other notable labs were a Cr of 2.3, BNP 84, INR subtherapeutic at 1.4. CXR was read as no acute processHe was thought to be wheezy, and was given 10 mg of dexamethasone IV, nebulizers. He was empirically started on a heparin drip (800 unit bolus, 1800 units/hr) given his h/o DVT and a subtherapeutic INR. He was then transferred to MARY. \n\n\n\nIn the ED here his INR was 2.4 (and his PTT was over 150). Upon interview here, he endorses the above history.

She has had three\noperations on her back, finally ending with a fusion of\nL2-L3 and a laminectomy in that area for recurrent disk\ndisease  at L2-L3.  She still is having severe pain going\ndown her right leg and anterior knee which is unchanged or\nperhaps somewhat better.  She sees Dr. Herring with\nregularity.  She has seen Dr. Oscar Riggs.  She has\nnothing wrong with her hips and she has had multiple CT\nscans showing the numerous operations and fusion.  \n\nMEDICATIONS:  \n1.  Lipitor 20 mg q.d. \n2.  Glynase 1.5 mg b.i.d. \n3.

She has been eating and has gained considerable\nweight.\n\nShe has no cardiopulmonary, GI or GU complaints.  She is to\nsee Dr. Bruce Godfrey's replacement in August and to get a\nmammogram at that time.  Hopefully, she will be able to lie\non the table when that occurs.  She is now able to drive a\ncar, but walks with a cane and cannot lie down with any\ndegree of ease.\n\nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  She weighs 192 lbs stripped and her\nblood pressure is 160/90 in the left arm standing, pulse is\n72 and regular.  She appears as a well developed, overweight\nwhite female in pain, having to hold on while standing,\neasily weeping, but pleasant.  There is no icterus, cyanosis\nor edema.  The eyes reveal 2+ arcus.  Pupils are round,\nreactive and equal.  Nose and throat examination is\nunremarkable.  Neck veins are flat.  Carotids are 2+ and\nequal and without bruit.  Thyroid small and smooth.  Lungs\nare clear to P&A. The heart is not enlarged.  There is a\nregular sinus rhythm and no significant murmurs.  S1 and S2\nare normal.  Liver and spleen cannot be felt.  She has good\nperipheral pulses.\n\nIMPRESSION:  \n1.  Diabetes mellitus type 2.  She has had an eye exam at\nMitchel Memorial Hospital this past year, but her diabetes is poorly\ncontrolled as her blood sugars have been in the 150-200\nrange.  I have told her to increase her Glynase to 3 mg\ntwice a day until she is able to diet.\n2.  L2-L3 disk with fusion. \n3.  Mild hypertension, on no medication.  Will not start any\nuntil she loses weight.\n\n\n______________________________\nBrett F.

Her husband visited\never three weeks or so.  She is walking somewhat better with\nless pain but moves very slowly.  She says that for the past\ntwo weeks she first had some substernal pressure which moved\ndown into her abdomen and now instead of having one bowel\nmovement every one or two weeks she is having a bowel\nmovement three times a week which is formed and not bloody. \n She put herself on Pepto-Bismol and is gradually getting\nbetter.\n\nShe has not had any chest pain, tachycardia, palpitations,\ncough or hemoptysis.  She has no visual signs.  She has not\nbeen seen by the ophthalmologist recently.  Her hearing is\ngood.  She has mammograms yearly.  She sees her gynecologist\non a yearly basis, Dr. Giles, having changed from Dr. Godfrey.\n She is not sexually active.  \n\nShe is not dieting and has not lost any weight.  Her back\npain is somewhat better.  \n\nMEDICATIONS:  She is on the following medications:  \n1.  Lipitor 20 mg q.d. \n2.  Glynase 1.5 mg b.i.d. \n3.  Avandia 4 mg q.a.m. \n4.  Trandate 100 mg q.d. \n5.  Tegretol 300 mg in the a.m. and 200 the evening (changed\nto 200 mg b.i.d.).  \n6.  Neurontin 200 mg b.i.d. \n7.  Premarin 0.625 mg 30 days a month.  \n8.  Provera 5 mg 12 days a month.  \n9.  Enteric coated aspirin 81 mg q.d.\n10. Calcium 1200 mg q.d. \n\nREVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  Her diabetes has been poorly regulated\nand hopefully the Avandia will make her feel better.  She\nstates that she takes the Avandia in the morning and she\nfeels very weak at lunchtime such that she has to get an\norange juice.  She says that her blood sugar has dropped but\nwhen she checks it, it has been around 100 mg%  and I\nexplained to her that it is a normal blood sugar but it may\nbe that the drop causes her to have symptoms.\n\nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION: She weighs 192 lbs stripped which is a\nweight gain for her.  Her blood pressure is 122/76 in the\nright arm sitting with a wide cuff.  She appears as a well\ndeveloped, pleasant white female, grossly overweight, moving\nslowly and can only get up on the examining table with help\nbecause of her back pain.  There is no icterus, cyanosis or\nedema.  The pupils are round, reactive and equal and react\nequally to light and accommodation.  Nose and throat\nexamination is unremarkable.  Neck veins are flat.  Carotids\nare 2+ and equal and without bruit.  Lungs are clear to P&A.\n Breasts reveal no masses or discharge.  The heart is not\nenlarged.  There is a regular sinus rhythm and no\nsignificant murmurs.  S1 and S2 are of normal intensity. \nLiver and spleen are not felt.  Bowel sounds are normal. \nThere are no abdominal masses or tenderness.  This is a\nfemale escutcheon.  Rectal was deferred.  She has fair\nperipheral pulses and decreased vibration sense in her feet.\n\nIMPRESSION:\n1.  Diabetes mellitus, poorly regulated.  Will check\nglycohemoglobin today.  \n2.  Diabetic neuropathy.  \n3.  L2-L3 disk with fusion.  \n4.  Hypercholesterolemia on Lipitor.\n5.  Weight management problem.\n\n\n______________________________\nBrett F.

She did call this service this past weekend she\nstates and never received a call back.  She called me this\nmorning, and I saw her immediately.  The pain has not gone\ndown her arms and it is mostly located in her chest.  She\nfeels occasionally like she is going to throw up, and she\nsays that her blood sugars have been quite high.  She does\nhave diabetes.\n\nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Her lungs are clear to P&A.  Her\nblood pressure is 130/80 in the right arm sitting with a\npulse of 64.  Her neck veins are flat, carotids 2+ and equal\nwithout bruit.  Heart is not enlarged.  There is a regular\nsinus rhythm, and no significant murmurs.  Liver and spleen\nare not felt.  EKG taken shows a possible old anterior\nmyocardial infarction, which is a distinct change from her\nlast EKG with poor progression of the R waves across the\nprecordium.\n\nIMPRESSION AND PLAN:  Question myocardial infarction. \nBecause of her prolonged pain and changes in the EKG, I\nthink that she should be observed in the BH emergency\nward and attend her there.\n\n\n______________________________\nBrett F.

She is followed up by Dr. Horne\nwho felt that she had a lot of anxiety and she was at that time\non lisinopril as well as her other diabetic medications.  She\ncomes back from Maine.  She is on the following medications:\n1.  Lipitor 20 mg q.d.\n2.  Glynase 1.5 mg b.i.d.\n3.  Glucophage 500 mg b.i.d.\n4.  Cozaar 50 mg b.i.d.\n5.  Avandia 4 mg q.a.m.\n6.  Trandate 100 mg q.d.\n7.

Calcium 1200 mg q.d.\n\nShe states today that her abdomen has been distended for the past\n5 days.  She has not had a bowel movement in 10 days.  She\nordinarily has a bowel movement once every 2 weeks.  She takes\nnothing to move her bowels and she is extraordinarily upset about\nher daughter who is homeless.  She has provided for her daughter,\nhelped her get a job, and the daughter is emotionally ill, and I\nhave advised the patient that she should be in a mental\ninstitution.  The patient no longer care for her daughter and her\ndaughter cares nothing about her father and mother.  It is a\nhopeless situation and 45 minutes were spent in discussion of the\ndaughter's illness and what the patient would do about this.  I\nhave told her to use some Dulcolax suppositories and Dulcolax by\nmouth for probable impacted feces, although this is not an\nuncommon thing for her and I have ordered a set of blood tests to\ncheck on her diabetes, kidney function, etc.  She has a good\nphysician in Maine where she is planning to move in June and\nshe will return to me next week for a complete physical.  She\ndoes have diabetic neuropathy mild and diabetic nephropathy mild.\n Her back has healed.  She no longer uses a cane to walk except\non climbing stairs.  She no longer has any chest pain or\nshortness of breath.  She is extraordinarily anxious and\nhopefully she will listen to the advice that I gave her.  Total\ntime spent during this visit was 45 minutes.\n\n\n______________________________\nBrett F.

I last saw her on 07/27/2112. She is a 72-year-old woman who is status post a right MCA distribution cortical infarct in April of 2112 with residual left hand weakness. Since I last saw her Mrs. Lindsay has not done very well. She has had multiple recent falls and her gait has become even more unsteady. She tends to veer to either side and does have a frequent feeling of lightheadedness. She has hit her head on a couple of occasions with these falls. \n\n  \nOf note her blood pressure medication has been essentially doubled since I last saw her. She is now taking 10 mg of Zestril every day instead of five and taking Atenolol 50 mg q.d. instead of 25 mg p.o. q.d. She does have intermittent weakness of the left hand which is likely recrudescent of her prior stroke symptoms and not new strokes. She does not have discoordination, vertigo or diplopia. She does have intermittent chest pains as well which she loath to bring to the attention of her physician.  She is reluctant to use a cane because her family states that \"her husband does not use a cane and he is older, why should she have to use a cane\". She has been switched to Plavix 75 mg p.o.  q.d. from aspirin. This was done without my knowledge as well.  She continues to have difficulty \"feeling my feet\" and this has been a chronic problem for her as well.  \n \nOn examination she is alert. She is a garrulous and tangential historian and needs to be frequently refocussed. Her speech is fluent in English. English is her second language and she is less fluent in that language. Her visual fields are full to confrontation. Her extraocular movements are full with no nystagmus. Her face is symmetric other than a mild left nasolabial fold flattening. She has a mild left pronator drift and slowed finger tapping on the left side. She has no ataxia on finger-to-nose-to-finger testing. Her gait is slightly wide-based and unsteady. She can veer to either side and frequently has to hold on to someone next to her for stability.  \n \nIMPRESSION: I do not feel that Mrs. Lindsay has had a new embolic event, however I am quite concerned about her continued falling and difficulty with both her continued peripheral neuropathy and likely hypoperfusion. This appears to be pressure dependent and I would suggest that we back off on her antihypertensive medications at this time. In looking at her recent CBCs she has also been consistently anemic and with her complaints of chronic fatigue I think this could certainly be a factor. Atenolol could certainly be a factor in this as well and perhaps a different antihypertensive medication could be considered or it could be discontinued altogether. Furthermore with her recurrent chest pains she should seek an opinion from her primary care physician regarding this and I have counseled her to do so.  \n \nI will see Mrs. Lindsay in follow up in 6 months time but I am available to discuss her care at any time in the interim.   \nSincerely, \n \n \nHudsen Parsons, M.D.  \n \nDD:03/08/2113 \nDT:03/11/2113 \nTL:7407      :3768\nRecord date: 2115-10-08\n\n \n\n\n\nEducare-Fargo A MSIII Admission Note\n\nPt: Lindsay, Anastasha\t\n\nMR#: \t 5563788\n\nDate of Admission: 10/07/15\n\nAttending: \t\n\n\n\nSource: Pt, Pt's daughter and husband, chart.\n\n\n\nCC:  Dizziness, unsteady gait, difficulty speaking per family\n\n\n\nHPI:  74 yo F with pmh of DM, CRI, Breast Ca, CVA, who is s/p cataract surgery on 09/25/15 presents with two days of unsteady gait, weakness, mild dysarthria and hallucinations.\n\n\n\nShe has a baseline amount of increasing forgetfulness, decreased appetite, and increased somnolence over the past 2 years.  She frequently forgets whether or not she has taken her medications.  She rarely leaves her home as her walking is limited by joint pain and shortness of breath.  She moves around the house infrequently and when she does it is usually from the bed to the couch per her daughter.  She has had several falls in the recent years.  She does not cook and is overall much less active than her husband who lives with her.  At her baseline, her family is concerned that she has been developing Alzheimer's Disease.  \n\n\n\nTwelve days ago, she underwent cataract surgery on her R eye and was in her usual state of health for several days thereafter.  However, two days ago, she started to hallucinate mentioning she was seeing flies, birds and spots.  Her family noted that she had difficulty forming words and also spoke incoherently at times.  She also complained of dizziness, had an increasingly unsteady gait, and did not want to eat both expressing no interest in food and saying she was worried about not being able to swallow.  She has also been falling asleep very rapidly recently, so much so that she has fallen asleep on her plate at the breakfast table.  However, she has also woken up frequently at night, often talking incoherently and once even getting up and attempting to cook breakfast at 3am.  Her family also mentions that her face had recently become swollen. Her family reports that her symptoms were worsened after she took her Diamox, and thus they stopped giving it to her.  \n\n\n\nShe was brought to the ED on 10/06/15 as her family was concerned that she had another CVA.  Her VS on admission were BP 120/41, HR 54, RR 18, T 96.4, O2 sat 96% on RA.  She had a negative CT, MRI, CXR and labs were drawn.  In the ED she reportedly had an episode of choking while eating a pancake. Currently, she reports that she is seeing many small black dots, is tired and has no dizziness, HA or pain.\n\n\n\nROS:  Notable on ROS is progressive dysphagia over the last year that she reports has gotten much worse of late.  She also reports occasional transient stabbing pain in the center of her sternum that often accompanies intense emotions and is not made worse by activity.   She has occasional palpitations.\n\nShe reports no recent fever, wt loss, cough, hemoptosis, orthopnea, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, dysuria, sick contacts.  She reports some urinary incontinence.\n\n\n\nPMH: \n\nBreast Ca- Diagnosed in 10/2111, she is s/p R lumpectomy and XRT for her tumor that was HER-2/neu 2+.  She is followed by Dr. Ursula Marshall at SDP.  \n\nDM- Controlled by insulin.

Patent foramen ovale.\n\n\n\nA/P:  74 yo F with pmh of DM, CRI, Breast Ca, CVA, who is s/p cataract surgery on 09/25/15 presents with two days of unsteady gait, weakness, mild dysarthria and hallucinations.  She has dementia at baseline and has recently had the addition of Diamox, a carbonic anhydrase inhibitor, to her medications.  This could have had the effect of decreasing her intravascular volume, thus leading to a prerenal state and her increased uremia, and decreased renal clearance of her renally cleared medications, thus leading to acute delirium on chronic dementia.  \n\n\n\nCommon causes of delirium include FEN disturbances, infections, drug toxicity, metabolic disorders, low perfusion states, withdrawal from alcohol or sedatives, and idiopathic.  In addition, there is the possibility of CVA, however the MRI and CT were negative and the time course and symptoms are not consistent with a CVA.  Of concern though is that she has somewhat atypical signs of delirium such as dysarthria and ataxia.\n\n\n\nMetabolic causes of delirium commonly include Na, Ca, Mg, B12, NH3 imbalances.  Her Na, Mg and Ca are wnl.  Her BUN is elevated at 77, which is close to twice her baseline, and in the setting of a fragile patient, this could be enough to tip her over to delirium.  Her glucose was 215 on admission, which is elevated, but only mildly so for a diabetic and not at high enough levels for MS changes to occur.\n\n\n\nInfection is possible as her WBC is slightly elevated at 12.1 with 78% poly's.  However, there is no obvious source of infection and she has a normal CXR and U/A, likely ruling out a PNA and UTI respectively.  She has no signs of infection at the site of her eye surgery.  She could have a bacteremia secondary to other infection or due to her procedure, but without a fever, this is highly unlikely.\n\n\n\nHer mental status change could be drug induced, as she is on multiple medications with the recent addition of Prednisolone and Vigamox eye drops as well as Diamox that was recently stopped by the family.  Eye drops generally do not get particularly high systemic absorption, although there is an anatomic proximity to the CNS.  However, cardiovascular drugs, antidepressants, and corticosteroids are all known to induce delirium and she is on all of them, including two SSRI's.  The new Diamox could be enough to tip her over as it is a diuretic and by itself it can cause confusion, and by inducing more diuresis, it can cause a prerenal state, thus decreasing renal clearance of her other drugs and increasing their levels, thus leading to delirium.   Indeed, her baseline Creatinine is from 1.6-1.9 and was 2.4 on admission to the ED and her baseline BUN is from 20-40 while it was 82 on admission to the ED.\n\n\n\nThere is no present concern for drug toxicity and her tox screen was negative.  There was no seizure activity noted and her symptoms have gone on too long to be a post-ictal state\n\n\n\nHer BP on admission was 115/51 and her pulse was 62, which does not point to a low perfusion state as a cause.  She had a recent stress test that was negative.  However, it is possible that she has some orthostasis, which would fit with her recent history of falls at home.  However, this would not cause the delirium.\n\n\n\nHer dementia has been developing over a few years and the possible etiologies include Alzheimer's, vascular dementia, pseudodementia, thyroid abnormalities, B12 and/or Folate deficiency, tertiary syphilis and chronic infarct dementia.  Chronic infarct dementia is a distinct possibility with MRI of brain showing chronic infarcts in the right posterior frontal and left parietal regions.  Her stasis, DM and high homocysteine levels (18.8 in 2113) are risk factors with PFO for multi-infarct dementia.\n\n\n\nPlan:\n\n1. Delirium:  \n\n500 cc bolus of NS, followed by maintenance IVF of 1/2NS at 80cc/hr.\n\nTSH, B12, Folate, RPR, ESR.\n\nD/C her HCTZ, Avapro, Atenolol and recheck her lytes in the AM.  \n\nCall PROMPTCARE in AM for consult re the d/c of Diamox.\n\nSeroquel 12.5 mg overnight.\n\n\n\n2. Renal failure:\n\n\tlikely pre-renal given FeNa<2% and response to fluids in ED\n\n\tcontinue gentle hydration\n\n\tD/C HCTZ, Diamox as likely precipitants of delerium and renal failure\n\n\n\n3. ID: \t Cont to monitor for signs/sx of infection.  None currently present.\n\n\n\n4. GI:\tElevated Pancreatic Enzymes: \n\nNo signs or symptoms currently.

In brief, 74F with dementia presenting with acute on chronic renal failure and delerium. Etiology likely multifactorial, however, diamox is the only new medication and may explain both her worsening renal failure and delirium. Will pursue broad differential as outlined above.\n\n\n\nUlysses Xiao\nRecord date: 2120-03-09\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nNeurology Resident ER Consult Note\n\n\n\nPatient Name:  Lindsay, Anastasha\n\n\n\nMRN: 5563788\n\n\n\nDate/Time/Place of Exam/Initial Assessment: 3/06/2120 3:50 p.m.\n\nTime paged:3:38 p.m.\n\nTine Called Back: 3:42 p.m.\n\nTime Reccs given: 4:30 p.m.\n\n\n\nConsulted by: \nED for L. facial droop, dysarthria; English speaking, interviewed  with translator\n\n\n\nHPI: Ms. Lindsay is 76y.o.

By report, patient was sitting on the couch at his sister's house, slumped to the floor and had seizure activity x 45seconds that was witnessed by EMS sevices. Accu-checks done at that time were >500 and attempts at intubation were unsuccessful. He was transported to ER, where additional attempts to secure his airway were also unsuccessful, by 2 physicians. There appeared to be some sot of stricture in the upper airway (not obvious on CT scan). However, pt had witnessed emesis, and was placed on 100% nonrebreather mask, with Versed and propofol for sedation with adequate O2 saturation. A x-ray confirmed dependent lung infiltrates consistent with aspiration pneumonia, and pt was started on Clindamycin.\n\n\n\nOn arrival to the ER, patient was also found to have a blood pressure of 248/146. He received 50mg dose of labetolol in the ER as well as several additional doses in the ICU. In the ICU, patient did not have any further witnessed seizure activity. A Head CT demonstrated no focal lesion, IC hemorrhage or other abnormality. Pt was treated with dilantin and IV insulin infusion. Serum ketones were negative. Additional workup revealed LVH by EKG criteria, as well as renal insufficiency Cr 2.6. Urine tox was positive for benzos, but was otherwise negative.\n\n\n\nPatient also developed leukoytosis (WBC ?) with temp of 102 degrees. Although he had minimal neck stiffness by neurology consult exam, he underwent a lumbar puncture that demonstrated a colorless clear fluid, with glucose of 108, TP 44. Grams stain was negative. Tube #4 contained 21RBCs and 7 WBCs with a diff of 96% PMNs and 4% lymphs. CSF cultures and blood cultures were also done, and are pending.\n\n\n\nDuring his hospital course, patient maintained adequate oxygenation with nasal trumpet in place. ABG on 08/25/61 am was 7.36/PCO2 45/ PO2 366, with bicarb of 25 and 100% sats. His FIO2 was subsequently weaned. He remained hemodynamically stable with BP 184/88 (MAP 114) HR100, RR23, 97% on cannula. Cardiac enzymes were negative.

Concern for hypertensive encephalopathy. Pt had LP at outside hospital which did not suggest meningitis. Other possibilities include infarct, encephalitis. Neurology consulted, with recommendations for:\n\nn\tEEG \n\nn\tMRI w/ susceptibility  to evaluate for posterior leukoencephalopathy, MRA head/neck, MRV brain\n\nn Dilantin (continued from OSH)\n\nn\tCheck tox screen, ammonia. Mother has brought in some unknown pills which we will try to identify.\n\n2.\tID - increased WBC, low grade temp s/p LP. No bacterial source for now, but CXR with opacities suspicious for pneumonia. Will start Vancomycin and cefepime empirically, and narrow per culture results. Concern for encephalitis, as HSV can present w/ HTN and seizures. Will ask Linden Health to add HSV PCR to CSF taken from LP prior to transfer. Start Acyclovir empirically in interim.\n\n3.\tResp - s/p multiple attempted intubations at OSH, currently breathing adequately on RA, with audible obstructive physiology. Given need for MRI, may have to sedate and intubate. Will call anesthesia. Continue intubated until MS more alert, for airway protection. Will start ARDSnet for criteria meeting low PaO2/FIO2 ratio and bilateral pulmonary infiltrates.\n\n4.\tCV- severe hypertension w/ evidence of potential end organ damage (kidney/brain/cardiac). Will control BP w/ Nipride drip, with addition of labetalol for HR control. Target goal 25% decrease to SPB~160 today, and SBP 120 the following day. Check CK/TPNs. Continue IVF for potential rhabdo.\n\n5.\tRenal - Renal failure w/ Cr 2.6, unclear baseline. Suspect acute on chronic component given DM w/ poor follow-up. Will check Urine sediment, lytes to evaluate. Reading by me is +hyaline/waxy casts but no WBC or RBC casts. Kidney U/S pending, also with Doppler to evaluate for RAS. Also check urine renin/aldo and 24hr metanephrine for pheochromocytoma, serum metanephrine, and 24hr protein for nephritic syndrome in presence of HTN and hematuria.\n\n6.\tEndo - tight glucose control; CZI drip for DM. Has gap but No ketones at OSH; did not arrive in DKA. Will need reg insulin after drip DC'd in future.\n\n7.\tAccess - PIV\n\n8.\tProphylaxis - nexium, heparin SQ, peridex, HOB 30.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInfant Ledford\n\n#12182\nRecord date: 2061-10-03\n\n \n\nBMH Cancer Center\n\nHematology Note\n\n\n\nFellow: James Tyler\n\nAttending:  Cole Morgan\n\n\n\nDate of consultation:  October 04, 2061\n\n\n\nDiagnosis:  thrombocytosis, reactive vs. essential thrombocytosis\n\n\n\nHPI:\n\n27 yo African American male with recent complicated hospital stay at BMH presents to hematology clinic for first time for follow up of his thrombocytosis.\n\n\n\nThis 27 yo male with history of type I DM who does not get regular medical care in late August was  visiting family in Maryland and had sudden witnessed seizure activity.  At the time, blood sugar was >500.  Upon initial arrival to the ER in Maryland, he has BP 248/146; plt count was in 800's.  The patient was intubated, treated for HTN with labetolol and placed on IV insulin and dilantin  and transferred to BMH for further care.  \n\n\n\nAt BMH, MRI showed several small areas of infarct read as concerning for embolic CVA- echo was done showing no vegetations, no PFO, NL EF with LVH; TEE without vegetations as well.  LP was done and sent for HSV which was negative.  He underent a renal workup which showed  nephrotic range proteinuria; labs also showed rhabdoymyolysis.   Renal doppler US showed no sign of RAS.  He was continued on abx for his  aspiration PNA.  Other parts of the secondary htn workup were done including evaluation for hyper aldo, pheo.\n\n\n\nThe vent was weaned and he was extubated on the 4th.  HTN was controlled with labetolol drip with additional oral agents being added.  He continued to have intermittent fevers and was on broad antibiotics which were originally weaned off.\n\n\n\nHematologically, the hct and wbc fell as he was hydrated.   Plt count stayed stable in the 600's for several days before increasing on the 3rd gradually up to the 1000's.   Retics were depressed at presentation and iron studies were c/w ACD and he was started on epogen.  Initially it was felt that his thrombocytosis was most certainly reactive; CRP was >150 with ESR >100.  He left the ICU and at this point his WBC trended down and he was afebrile and more clinically stable.  But his platelets kept climbing to nearly 1.5 million.  A bone marrow biopsy was done showing no cytogenetics to suggest CML and there were elevated megakaryocytes read as concerning for a myeloproliferative process.  As well, he suffered a DVT in his subclavian/IJ on the same side as a central venous catheter.  Given his thrombocytosis and elevated plt count, he was platelet pheresed twice in the hospital.  As well, hydrea was started at this time, initially at 500mg bid and then escalated to 1000mg bid when his counts were up to 800-900 despite the medication.  As well, he suffered a small GI bleed due to an ulcer.  For this reason he was not anticoagulated but placed upon daily ASA.\n\n\n\nHe was discharged from the hospital two weeks ago and has done fairly well since then.  His energy has been good.  He denies any fevers/chills/sweats.  No bleeding/bruising.  No further swelling in his arms/legs.  He does have some occasionally blurryness in eyes immediately after taking his anti-hypertensives but no numnbess/weakness/dizziness.\n\n\n\n\n\nProblems/PMH:\n\nDM type 1 since age 12\n\nno recollection of any abnormal blood counts prior to this admit\n\n\n\nNew diagnoses on this admit\n\nrenal insufficiency\n\nnephrotic proteinuria\n\nmalignant hypertension\n\nthrombocytosis\n\nGI bleed- upper with ulcer visualized on EGD\n\nsmall embolic appearing CVA's\n\n\n\nMedications:\n\nDiovan\n\nlisinopril\n\nHydrea 1000 bid\n\nASA 81 qod\n\nlopressor\n\nprocardia\n\nclonidine\n\nnexium\n\n\n\ninsulin:  am 25 regular/34 NPH, pm  20 regular/28 NPH\n\n\n\nAllergies:\n\nnkda\n\n\n\nSocial History:\n\nlives in waycross; single\n\nworks in Geologist\n\nno tob\n\nreports social etoh\n\n\n\nFamily History:\n\nhtn\n\n\n\nPhysical Examination:\n\n\n\nVital Signs\n\nBP 101/63, P 64, RR 16, Temp 98.1 F, Wt 202 lb\n\ngen:  well-appearing male, alert, conversant, nad\n\nheent:  supple, non-icteric, no cervical/supraclav adenopathy\n\nchest:  clear \n\ncv:  reg\n\nabd;  benign with no hsm\n\next:  trace LE edema, no upper edema\n\nskin:  scattered ulcerations on his arms with granulation tissue,  scarred vesicular changes on his neck\n\n\n\n\n\nData:\n\n\n\n10/03/2061 WBC 4.1 (L),  RBC 3.95 (L),  HGB 12.0 (L),  HCT 35.5 (L),  MCV 90,  MCH 30.4,  MCHC 33.8,  PLT 601 (H)\n\n\n\n10/03/2061 RDW 17.2 (H)\n\n\n\n10/03/2061 DIFFR RECEIVED,  METHOD ,  %NEUT 57,  %LYMPH 36,  %MONO 3 (L),  %EOS 3,  %BASO 1\n\n\n\n10/03/2061 ANEUT 2.35,  ALYMP 1.48,  AMONS 0.10 (L),  AEOSN 0.10,  ABASOP 0.02\n\n\n\n10/03/2061 RETIC 1.0\n\n\n\n\n\nAssessment and Plan:\n\n\n\nInteresting case of a 27 yo male with insulin dependent diabetes and apparent untreated HTN who presented with seizure in setting of hypertensive emergency and is found with nephrotic syndrome, renal insufficiency, several small embolic-appearing strokes and has developed marked thrombocytopenia to 1.5 million and had subsequent provoked DVT.  He was treated for concern of essential thrombocytosis in hospital with platelet pheresis then hydrea.  Today, he presents looking well and still has a thrombocytosis despite the hydrea.  It is still not possible to tell for sure if this is still a reactive thrombocytosis vs Essential thrombocytosis.\n\n\n\nAt the moment, we will continue to treat this as ET and will continue hydrea at the current dose and ask him to take aspirin 81 mg qd.  If this is a reactive process, time should be a good diagnostic test at this should improve after he is further from his complicated hospital/icu stay.\n\n\n\nAt his next visit with us next month we will recheck his C-reactive protein, ESR, iron studies/ferritin for some idea of whether his body could still be mounting an inflammatory response to drive a reactive thrombocytosis.  If his plt count comes down, we will be able to start tapering his hydrea at that time.\n\n\n\nOf note, in the near future, we may be able to help determine between reactive and essential process with measurement of the JAK2 kinase level.  \n\n\n\nIn the meantime, he will be meeting with his new PCP and renal physician next week.    \n\n\n\n_____________________________________________\n\nJames B.

Retics were depressed at presentation and iron studies were c/w ACD and he was started on epogen.  Initially it was felt that his thrombocytosis was most certainly reactive (CRP was >150 with ESR >100).  He left the ICU and at this point his WBC trended down and he was afebrile and more clinically stable.  But his platelets kept climbing to nearly 1.5 million.  A bone marrow biopsy was done showing normal cytogenetics and no evidence for CML.  His bone marrow did demonstrate elevated megakaryocytes, concerning for a myeloproliferative process.  As well, he suffered a DVT in his subclavian/IJ on the same side as a central venous catheter.  Given his thrombocytosis and elevated plt count, he was platelet pheresed twice in the hospital.  As well, hydrea was started at this time, initially at 500mg bid and then escalated to 1000mg bid when his counts were up to 800-900 despite the medication.  As well, he suffered a small GI bleed due to an ulcer.  For this reason he was not anticoagulated but placed upon daily ASA.  He was discharged from the hospital in September.   \n\nSince then he has been followed in hematology clinic.  Initially, his platelets were still in the hi 500's despite hydrea at 1000 bid.  His hematocrit was mildly depressed at this point as well (29-31%). He was re-evaluated on 12/05/61.  His platelets were 502,000.  An epo level was drawn and his hydrea was increased to 1500/1000mg.  He was re-evaluated on 12/26/61 and found to have a hematocrit of 26.2%, WBC of 2.7K, and platelets of 508,000.  His hydrea was decreased to 500mg bid. \n\nInterval History:\nSince his last visit, he left for Wynne for one month.  When he returned, his creatinine had increased to 4.0.  A renal biopsy performed last week showed diabetic nephropathy.  He is being evaluated by Dr. Xing for dialysis and renal transplant evaluation.  \n\nIn terms of his blood disorders, the patient has been at his baseline fatigue, slightly improving over the past few months.  He has no fevers, chills, night sweats, or unexplained weight loss.  He had one episode of transient global blurry vision 3 weeks ago which resolved on its own and has not recurred.  He has no headaches, other sensory deficits, or focal neurologic symptoms.  He has no oral ulcers or skin lesions from his Hydrea.  \n\nProblems\nDiabetes mellitus type 1 \nNephrotic syndrome \nmalignant hypertension \nThrombocytosis : unclear if secondary vs essential\nRenal insufficiency \nCerebrovascular accident : embolic, unclear source.

In this setting, he has developed marked thrombocytosis to 1.5 million and had subsequent provoked DVT.  He was treated with platelet pheresis, then hydrea.  It has been unclear if this is still a reactive thrombocytosis vs essential thrombocytosis.  We are following his CBC on hydrea.\n\nHis platelets are moderately elevated (757K).  He has no evidence of recurrent thrombosis.  His current hydrea dosing cannot be increased due to his anemia.  We would advise starting erythropoetin, monitoring his blood pressure closely.  At his current platelet count, his risk of thrombosis is not greatly increased, especially as his platelets are dysfunctional due to uremia.  We would advise continuing current hydrea. \n\nContinue current hydrea\nMonitor counts monthly\nAgree with starting erythropoetin in Internal Medicine. \nReturn in 4 months for follow-up of counts\n\nThe patient was seen and discussed with Dr. Morgan. \n\n\n\n\n_____________________________________________\nInge J. Logan, M.D.\nRecord date: 2062-05-30\n\n\n\n\n\nInternal Medicine\n\nBARTON MEMORIAL HOSPITAL\n\n\n\nHistory of present illness\n\n\t\t\t\n\n  This was a followup visit for this 28-year-old black man with the medical problems of type 1 diabetes mellitus, hypertension, thrombocytosis, and chronic renal insufficiency. The patient states that since I last saw him, he is being evaluated further for renal transplant. In addition, attempts were made to place an AV fistula for dialysis in his right arm and this did not work out. Given that this one did not work out, a decision was made to wait to see if there was a transplant candidate for him to get a renal transplant rather than put all of the pieces in place for hemodialysis if in fact he would need it. Most recently, the patient's creatinine was 6.4 and his BUN was 46 two weeks ago.\n\n\n\nMajor Problems\n\n\n\n\n\nDiabetes mellitus\n\nType 1 diabetes mellitus.  The patient's diabetes is currently well controlled on his current regimen of NPH and Regular Insulin.  Most recently, his hemoglobin A1c was 6.6 on 02/27/2062.  The patient states that all of his fingersticks at home have been consistently between 70 and 110.\n\n\n\nChronic renal insufficiency\n\nThe patient is being evaluated for renal transplant and possible candidate that his family members and friends will be tested to see whether there are a match shortly.\n\n\n\nHypertension\n\nThe patient is on a tremendous amount of medication to treat his hypertension. Currently, he is on labetalol 600 mg PO BID, furosemide 20 mg PO QD, clonidine 0.3 mg PO QHS, lisinopril 40 mg PO QD, and nifedipine XL 90 mg PO QHS. BHypertension is currently well controlled on this regimen.\n\n\n\nErectile dysfunction\n\nThe patient was experiencing erectile dysfunction largely on Toprol.  For this reason, the Toprol was discontinued and the patient is having less of a problem with this issue currently.\n\n\n\nAnemia\n\nThe patient's anemia is due to multiple different factors.  He has recently been started on erythropoietin, which he is getting via injection in the Internal Medicine three times a week.  Most recently, his hematocrit was 29.4% two weeks ago.\n\n\n\nThrombocytosis\n\nThe patient is on Hydria 500 mg PO QD for this problem and he is being followed by Hematology.\n\n\n\nHyperlipidemia\n\nThe patient's hyperlipidemia is new.  Most recently, his lipids were done on 02/27/2062 and at that time his total cholesterol was 294 and his LDL was 209.  This is a new problem for the patient, given that his lipids were fairly normal six months ago.  Given this, the patient was started on Lipitor 20 mg PO QD for hyperlipidemia.  We will repeat his lipid panel at the time of his next visit in eight weeks.\n\n\n\nActive Medications\n\n\n\naspirin 81mg po qd\n\nclonidine 0.3mg po 1 tabs po q pm\n\nfurosemide 20 mg po qd\n\nHumulin n 40 units qam sc 36 units qpm take 30-60min before a meal or hs\n\nHydrea 500mg po bid\n\nInsulin syringes (u 100) \n\nlabetalol HCl tablets 600 mg po bid\n\nLancets \n\nLipitor 20mg po qd\n\nlisinopril 40mg po qd\n\nNexium 40mg po bid take 1h before meal\n\nnifedipine xl 90mg sr po qhs do not cut/crush/chew\n\nOnetouch test strips \n\npotassium chloride 10meq po qd\n\nregular insulin 25 units qam  sc 20 units qpm give 30-60min before a meal\n\n\n\nChange in therapies and Renewals\n\n\n\nHydrea 500mg po bid QTY:60 Refills:5 Start: 10/16/2061\n\nToprol xl 100 mg po bid QTY:30 Refills:5 Start: 10/16/2061 End: 5/30/2062 - Inactivated\n\nfurosemide 20 mg po qd QTY:30 Refills:5 Start: 10/16/2061\n\nlabetalol HCl tablets 600 mg po bid QTY:60 Refills:5 Start: 05/30/2062\n\nLipitor 20mg po qd QTY:30 Refills:5 Start: 05/30/2062\n\n\n\nPhysical examination\n\nBlood pressure 120/88  \n\nWeight   215 pounds\n\nGeneral appearance   This was a well-developed, well-nourished black man, in no distress\n\nChest   Lungs were clear throughout to AandP\n\nCor   Regular rate and rhythm with no murmurs, rubs, or gallops\n\n\n\nSelected recent labs\n\n\t\t\t\n\n  Fingerstick blood sugar 75.\n\n\n\nDisposition\n\nThe patient will follow up with me again in six to eight weeks.\n\n\n\nNote transcribed by outside service\n\n\t\t\t\n\n  Transcription errors may be present.\n\n\n\nSigned electronically by Ali, Felicia on Jun 6, 2062\nRecord date: 2062-08-30\n\n\n\n \n\nCCU JAR Admit Note\n\n\n\n\n\nName:  Jacob Goins\n\nMR #: 6850327 (Please note that pt also has MRN 4033790)\n\nDate of admission: 8/30/2062\n\nResident: Addison Keefe\n\nAttending: Angel Vail\n\nPCP: Felicia Ali\n\nSource: Medical Record and Family\n\n\n\nCC: L Arm Weakness\n\n\n\nHPI:  28 yo RH M h/o DM1, ESRD on HD, HTN, Stroke (thought to be due to thrombocytosis), GTC in setting of HTN one year ago (and in June per family), multiple HTN episodes on many anti-hypertensives, RIJ thrombosis, had transient L arm weakness at HD followed by some difficulty speaking and change in his mental status.  He was reportedly in good health the night prior to admission and the morning of admission per his family, with no sick contacts and no travel.  At HD he was hypertensive with SBP in 200s, had transient L arm weakness and paresthesias which then resolved and had difficulty speaking and following commands after being noted by his nephrologist at an OSH to be mentating well with normal speech.  No urinary/bowel incontinence, tonic-clonic movements or syncope was noted by his providers.  He was brought to BMH ED because of these problems. \n\n\n\n\tIn the ED, his initial VS were BP 211/120 HR 88 T 98 R 18 SaO2 100% RA.   he received a Head CT which showed  no acute infarct or ICH  , an MRI which showed  no acute infarct on  DWI, but he was agitated in the scanner and could not complete the study.  He received 5 mg hydralazine iv x 2 and was started first in a TNG gtt and then on a nitroprusside gtt to 100/min titrated to a goal of MAP 120.  His BP was 251/104 at 2315. and was  His L Arm Weakness resolved, but he was agitated and he transiently wanted to leave AMA, and was admitted to the CCU for further management.\n\n\n\nROS:  Per HPI.

He has been working with OT, speech therapy and nutrition at home, with some improvement in gait and fine motor skills.  He still feels like his speech is poor and his right hand is not working at baseline.  Other complaints include a HA every morning which is global and tends to improve over the course of the day with tylenol.  He does admit to some visual changes that have been occuring for about one year--transient decreased vision in right eye, lasting for several minutes to hours and happening about twice per week.  He saw an ophthamologist in 12/02 who, per the patient, found no abnormalities.  He also states that he has had nonproductive cough with chest congestion for about 2 weeks. No fevers, chills, n/v or diarrhea.  Some rhinorrhea but no sinus sxs.  He has had difficulty with muscle cramps since his BMT which respond well to gatorade.  The nutritionist is not thrilled with the high salt content of gatorade.  We discussed the possibility of drinking less gatorade and adding a banana daily. \n\n\n\nMEDS:\n\nlopressor 25 TID\n\ncoumadin 5 QHS\n\n\n\nPE: 97.1   66   144/90, repeat 130/90    wt 225\n\ngen: NAD, slightly dysarthric\n\nneuro: CNII-XII intact except for slight right mouth droop; strength is 5/5 both upper and lower extremities; biceps and patellar DTRs 2+ symmetrically; gait is steady, but heel to toe is unsteady\n\nCV: distant RRR without murmurs\n\nPulm: soft bibasilar crackles; no wheezes, rhonchi or areas of consolidation. no dullness to percussion\n\nSkin: flaking over forehead and nasal bridge with slight redness\n\nRectal: erythema perirectally without bleeding or hemorrhoids. sl decreased rectal tone, no tenderness guaic neg brown stool\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLabs: 4/22 INR 2.8\n\n4/26: CBC, Chem 7, coags pending\n\n\n\nA/P: 53 yo man with h/o lymphoma s/p allo BMT in 10/78 c/b chronic skin GVHD, pseudomonal pna and post herpetic neuralgia who was recently hospitalized with central pontine CVA.

I hadn't seen him since last year.  I'm very pleased to see how well he's done.  He has had no double vision, no staggering, and no numbness around the mouth.  His speech is a little slurred he says (unchanged).  He walks with a wide-based gait, but is otherwise steady on his feet.  There is no tremor.  His arms and legs are strong.  Extraocular movements are full.  The pupils are equal.  There is no ptosis.  His speech is fluent.\n\n\n\n     He takes one aspirin a day as well Lipitor and some vitamins (the other medicines he doesn't recall but I think you are in the know about).  \n\n\n\n     His blood pressure is 120/80.  The pulse is around 76.  There are no cervical bruits.  \n\n\n\n     From my perspective he is doing well on the aspirin and we should sit tight.  I would like to see him again in a year and at that time we should have our Dopplers again to recheck the flow in the basilar artery. The right vertebral is dominant and the left is occluded.  The left MCA stem was hard to visualize on the imaging.  It may well be occluded with collateralization. The left imaging was in 2082.  He is stable at this time.  He knows to call if he develops any symptoms.\n\n\n\nBest regards,\n\n\n\n\n\nG. Kevin Yawn, M.D.\nRecord date: 2087-03-01\n\n Patient here for f/u COPD.

He states that since beginning the Flomax that we started him on in January, his symptoms are at least 50% better.  He is only getting up once per night to go to the bathroom and is not having any hesitancy or difficulty passing his urine.  He is also following up on his elevated cholesterol, his hypertension.  He states that he has been trying to follow a better diet, but does state that he has not been particularly good about getting regular exercise.  He is also following up on his diabetes.  He is not having any difficulty with his medications.  He did not schedule his colonoscopy that I had referred him for in January but states that he would be willing to do so after the spring.  He is also following up on his COPD.  He states that he has been using the Pulmicort and the Spiriva as well as the Serevent Diskus on a daily basis.  He states that his breathing has been good.  He is hardly wheezing at all and he has better exercise tolerance than before.  He is also noted to have hepatitis C as well as fatty liver.  A recent ultrasound also demonstrated gallstones.  He does not have any postprandial symptoms of right upper quadrant pain, nausea or vomiting.  He does question whether or not he is a candidate for treatment of hepatitis C.\n\nPAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Significant for B-cell lymphoma, pontine stroke, basilar artery stent, herpes zoster, graft versus host disease, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, hyperhomocysteinemia, Pseudomonas pneumonia, COPD, diabetes, heart murmur, BPH and hepatitis C as well as gallstones and fatty liver.\n\nMEDICATIONS:  Serevent Diskus, metformin, folate, Flomax, Spiriva, albuterol, Lopressor, Combivent, Pulmicort, vitamin B12, vitamin B6, magnesium and aspirin.\n\nALLERGIES:  He has an allergy to ACE inhibitors, dapsone, ganciclovir, sulfa, and Bactrim.\n\nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Blood pressure is 140/90, on repeat 148/90, pulse is 64, temperature 97.1 and weight is 259 pounds.  In general, he is in no acute distress.  The HEENT exam demonstrates no icterus and no injection.  The oropharynx is clear.  Neck is supple.  There is no lymphadenopathy.  Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally with no wheezes and no rales.  Heart is regular rate and rhythm with no murmurs, rubs or gallops.  The abdomen is soft, nondistended, and nontender.  There is no hepatosplenomegaly.  The extremities show no edema.\n\nASSESSMENT AND PLAN:\n1.  Diabetes, his most recent hemoglobin A1c was 6.5 and this does not need to be done again until July.  He was advised again to continue to follow a healthy diet and offered again referral to a nutritionist, currently declines at this time.  He is up-to-date with his Ophthalmology exam.\n2.  BPH.  We will increase his Flomax to 0.8 mg to see if we can further improve his symptoms.  Fortunately they are responding quite well to this.\n3.  Hypertension.  This is not adequate control with his current regimen, however, we are increasing his Flomax today so I would like to see how he does in terms of his blood pressure when I see him back in a month.  If his blood pressure is still elevated, we will then modify his antihypertensive regimen to improve this.\n4.  COPD.  Currently, he is doing well with his current regimen.  He has no evidence of a flare at this time and he is advised to continue getting as much exercise as possible.\n5.  Elevated cholesterol.  His LDL goal should be less than 100 if not less than 70 given his multiple medical issues.  If his LDL is greater than 70 on this most recent check we may try him on a small dose of simvastatin to see if we can get him under goal without an elevation in his liver function tests.\n6.  Abnormal liver function tests.  These are a combination of his hepatitis C and the fatty liver.  It is reasonable to have him seen in Hepatology to see if he would be a candidate for treatment of the hepatitis C.  For now, we will work on his diabetes, weight loss and management of his cholesterol and we will refer him to Hepatology.  Follow up with me is in one month.\n\n\n______________________________\nGrace Knapp, M.D.\n\n\n\n\n\neScription document:1-5138285 CSSten Tel\n\n\n\nDD: 04/23/88\nDT: 04/23/88\nDV: 04/19/88"}

At around 6: 30 PM, her mother reports that she appeared to be repeatedly bending down to pick up something that wasn't there and she was not responding to voice. However, when EMS arrived, she was responding to their questions and appeared alert.

I concur with the resident's\n\nfindings.\n\nHISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Briefly, this is an extraordinarily\n\ncomplex 47-year-old patient with renal insufficiency, nephrotic\n\nsyndrome, and severe anemia who was scheduled to receive some\n\nintravenous iron today but the presence of multiple abnormalities\n\nin her blood prompted her to be referred here instead for\n\nadmission.  She herself complains of generalized weakness but\n\ndoes not have any localizing or acute new symptoms.  Remainder of\n\nhistory and physical examination were reviewed and verified and\n\nare as noted.\n\nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  The patient is awake and alert.  Speech is\n\nnormal in rate, rhythm, and quality.  Skin is warm and dry.  She\n\nis in no distress.

The patient was seen and examined by me, and\n\nI confirm the resident's findings.\n\nHISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  In brief, Ms. Kimbrough is a\n\n46-year-old woman with history of hypothyroidism, anxiety,\n\ndiabetes, and nephrotic syndrome.  She is also dialysis\n\ndependent.  Her last dialysis was yesterday, she developed acute\n\nonset chest pressure with severe shortness of breath and\n\ndiaphoresis while at home.  Called EMS and was brought to the\n\nEmergency Department.  The patient is unable to give a full\n\nhistory and at this time secondary to her significant respiratory\n\ndistress.  Please review resident's note for full details of\n\nobtainable past medical history, social history, review of\n\nsystems, medications, and allergies.\n\nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  I confirm the physical exam is as\n\ndocumented.  The patient is awake in severe respiratory distress.\n\n Pulse is 126, respirations 40, blood pressure is initially noted\n\nat 253/129, and oximetry is 92% on facemask.  Physical exam\n\nreveals a diaphoretic woman who is breathing rapidly with\n\naccessory muscle use, nasal flaring and tripoding.  She has rales\n\nhalfway up bilaterally with inspiratory and expiratory wheezes. \n\nCardiac exam reveals tachycardia.  Abdomen is obese but soft. \n\nExtremity exam reveals bilateral 3+ edema up to the knees. \n\nRectal exam reveals trace heme-positive stool that is brown.\n\nOn route, the patient received multiple doses of sublingual\n\nnitroglycerin as well as IV Lasix.  She is known to make urine, a\n\nFoley catheter was placed immediately.  IV access was\n\nestablished, and the patient received large doses of diuretics. \n\nWas immediately started on IV nitroglycerin and a BiPAP.  On\n\nBiPAP, the patient's oxygenation was 100%.\n\nLABORATORY DATA:  Labs were obtained, which showed a hematocrit\n\nof 36, and BUN and creatinine of 15 and 5.1.  BNP was noted at\n\n700.  Cardiac enzymes:  CK was 334, CK-MB 4.9, and troponin was\n\nless than assay.  However, labs were obtained within half an hour\n\nof her symptoms starting, magnesium was low at 1.6.  Urinalysis\n\nwas negative and urine HCG was negative.  EKG was sinus\n\ntachycardia without any ST or T-wave changes concerning for\n\nrate-related ischemia.  There were no prior EKGs available. \n\nChest x-ray showed bilateral CHF.  The Nephrology fellow covering\n\nhemodialysis was notified that the patient would need immediate\n\nhemodialysis and this was scheduled for 6:00 a.m.\n\nDIAGNOSIS:  End-stage renal disease, hemodialysis dependent, and\n\nCHF.\n\nASSESSMENT:  Given the patient's constellation of symptoms, it is\n\nlikely that she had an ischemic event that caused flash pulmonary\n\nedema and subsequent symptomatology.  Given the current regimen,\n\nin the Emergency Department, the patient gradually improved.  The\n\nrespiratory rate was noted at 23.  Her heart rate came down to\n\n113 and blood pressure was well controlled on the IV\n\nnitroglycerin noted finally at 140/77.

No prior history of stroke or TIA. \n\n\n\nMEDS: ASA, Metformin, Glyberide, Tegretol, Fosinoperil, Lipitor, HCTZ\n\n\t\t\t\n\nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION\n\nVITALS: \tBP 130/85\n\nMS:\tAA&Ox3, speech fluent with slurring (unclear baseline), repeats and names well.  Comprehends simple commands.  Names president\n\nCN: \tPERRL, VF full with BTT. EOMI but with nystagmus in all directions of gaze, even primary gaze. Facial sensation intact.  Face asymmetric. Tongue, palate symmetric.  SCM and traps 5/5. \n\nMotor:\tUMN pattern weakness in RUE (4-/5), most notable in hands. Mild  proximal RLE weak (4+/5).  \n\nCoord:\tImpaired FTN in LUE, intact in RUE.   \n\nRefl:\tDeep tendon reflexes are 2+ at biceps, triceps, brachioradialis, patella, and ankles.  Plantar response is flexor on right and extensor on left.             \n\nSens:              Decreased PP but NOT LT in LUE and LLE \n\n\n\nImaging: \n\nMRI Brain (9/25/75)     DWI bright ADC dark right lateral medullary pyramid with associated increased T2 signal.\n\nMRA Head/Neck (9/25/75)     Narrowing of basilar artery with flow signal throughout and no thrombosis  \n\nCTA Head/Neck (9/25/75)     Diffuse atherosclerotic disease, occluded R-ICA with good collateralization of right hemisphere, severe irregular narrowing through out bilateral vertebral arteries and basilar arteries. \n\n\n\nIMPRESSION: The patient has numerous risk factors for stroke with HTN, DM2, and HLP. His exam is consistent with lateral medullary pyramid lesion with involvement of spinalcortical tract prior to decussation explaining ipsilateral weakness and also involvement of the spinalthalamic tract explaining contralateral deficit in pain sensation. His vessel imaging is notable and concerning for diffuse atherosclerotic disease, specifically in posterior circulation in distribution of acute stroke. The patient was reportedly taking aspirin, though reports are mixed and this needs clarification. Vessel imaging did not implicate that the patient suffered from acute vertebro-basilar thrombo-embolism, but that his posterior circulation disease is a chronic issue and the stroke was more likely due to distal vessel thrombosis. Anticoagulation can be considered in acute setting of small sized posterior circulation stroke with vertebro-basilar disease, but in this case by the time the patient became known to neurology service and by the time it was known he had a stroke it was some 24hrs after initial symptoms, and in this interval he did not show any signs or symptoms of stroke progression making unstable plaque unlikely. Given the findings of the WASID study that anticoagulation did not significantly improve recurrent stroke prevention benefits over aspirin for symptomatic vertebro-basilar disease (because warfarin benefits were offset by higher hemorrhage rates), the decision to place this patient on aspirin is supported. The long term management of this patient requires aggressive control of atherosclerotic risk factors such as HTN, DM2, and HLP. The patient is significantly at risk of major ischemic stroke due to occluded right carotid artery and diffuse posterior circulation disease, and it is conceivable that if he continues to have persistent symptoms in the future that a revascularization procedure may be necessary.   \n\n\n\nRECOMMENDATIONS:\n\n1.\tAspirin 325 mg po qd\n\n2.\tContinue Lipitor \n\n3.\tHTN management as an outpatient, autoregulate x 24hrs for SBP<180 mmHg  \n\n4.\tDM2 management \n\n5.\tCheck lipids, homocysteine, lipoprotein a, hba1c\n\n6.\tCheck TCDs to obtain baseline data\n\n7.\tConsider TTE/Holter as outpatient as unlikely this was a cardioembolic event \n\n________________________________\n\nFreddie V.

She has been having\nsymptoms of ataxia which are difficult to understand in the sense that I cannot get a\nclear history of her symptoms. At times she reports that she feels dizzy as if she might\nfall over to her right side. There is no associated vertigo, dysarthria or other\nsymptoms. She has not actually had syncope. There is no positional component to her\nsymptoms. I had scheduled her for an MRA/MRI to evaluate those symptoms. The\nMRI does show some small microvascular changes in the coronal radiata, centrum\novale and bilateral pontine region. She had small chronic lacunar infarcts. She reports\nthat she falls to the right, but the stroke seemed to be more on the right brain which\nwould not necessarily correlate with her symptoms. She had some left internal carotid\nmild 30% proximal stenosis. Her vertebral arteries were patent with anti-grade flow.  \n\nPHYSICAL EXAM:  Small lacunar infarcts. Most likely related to hypertension rather\nthan embolic disease. Her blood pressure has been very well controlled. In fact, today\non exam, her blood pressure was 100/60. She brought her medications with her and\nhas been taking atenolol 50 mg p.o. q.d., Cozaar 50 mg 1 tab twice a day and\nhydrochlorothiazide 12.5 mg p.o. q.d. She had not taken her medications today and\nher blood pressure here when I repeated it was 110/70 in the right arm and 120/70 in\nthe left. Her neck is supple without JVD or bruits. Her lungs are clear without\nwheezes, rales or rhonchi. Her cardiac exam shows a regular rate and rhythm, normal\nS1, S2. \n       \nASSESSMENT AND PLAN:   History of hypertension. Now with lower blood\npressure and some lightheadedness. We will d/c her atenolol. I would like her to get a\nrepeat blood pressure in one week. I discussed her MRI/MRA findings with her.\nLong term we will need to continue to try and optimize her cholesterol levels and her\ndiabetes. She will follow up in one week for a repeat blood pressure.\n    \n\nJulie Fraser, M.D.\n\nJF/crane/powell\nRecord date: 2093-10-18\n\nNAME:     Wilson, Gabriel\n\nMRN:     8514931\n\n\n\nHISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Gabriel Wilson is a 72-year-old Croatian\n\nfemale, referred by Dr. Fraser for evaluation of complaints of dizziness. Her daughter,\n\nwho is a Library Manager here, accompanies her mother today. Apparently, for\n\nmany years, perhaps as many as five, her mother has complained of \"feeling pulled\"\n\nwhen she walks. This never occurs when lying down or sitting. It is only when she is\n\nwalking that she feels she is being pulled, either to the right, left, forward or\n\nbackward. At times, she does visibly veer when she walks. She has had one fall a\n\nnumber of months ago when she broke her wrist. She has not had any subsequent\n\nfalls. There is no associated true spinning vertigo, no associated visual change,\n\nnumbness, weakness, change in gait, change in speech and no headache. She actually\n\nfeels that over the past few weeks, it has been a little better, though prior to that, it\n\nwas a little more severe. Unable to associate this with any clear intervention.\n\nUnaware of any precipitating or alleviating symptoms. \n\n\n\nReview of other systems notable for general fatigue. Otherwise unremarkable. No\n\nchest pain, shortness of breath or abdominal pain. \n\n\n\nPAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Hepatitis B, diabetes, hypertension, GE reflux,\n\nhyperlipidemia, depression, cataracts. \n\n\n\nMEDICATIONS:  Aspirin, Colace, Cozaar, Flonase, Fosamax, hydrochlorothiazide,\n\nLopid, meclizine p.r.n., Protonix, Prozac, Vioxx. \n\n\n\nFAMILY HISTORY: Negative for neurologic disease. \n\n\n\nSOCIAL HISTORY:  She is widowed and lives with her niece. She neither drinks nor\n\nsmokes. \n\n\n\nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION: On exam, she is a pleasant, quiet, soft-spoken,\n\n72-year-old female. BP 140/84. Cranial nerves II through XII intact to detailed exam,\n\nexcept for decreased hearing on the left. On motor exam, no rigidity, no drift. Good\n\npower throughout upper and lower extremities. She does, however, seem mildly\n\nbradykinetic diffusely. Finger tapping was slow bilaterally and symmetric. Amplitude\n\nis normal for finger tapping. Power in the lower extremities 5/5. Sensory exam with\n\nmild vibratory loss in the toes. Finger-to-nose testing intact. Foot-tapping decreased\n\nbilaterally. Romberg sway. Her gait is slightly wide-based, with occasional veering to\n\neither side. She is unable to perform tandem. DTR's 2+ throughout, except for 1+\n\nankle jerks. Babinski flexor bilaterally. \n\n\n\nDATA: MRI/MRA of the brain 8/30 shows mild to moderate white matter\n\nhyperintensity in the corona radiata, centrum semiovale and moderate bilateral\n\npontine involvement and multifocal lacunar infarcts of the lentiform nuclei, right\n\ninternal capsule and bilateral thalami. Intracranial atherosclerosis is seen involving the\n\nanterior middle cerebral arteries with a greater degree of involvement of the\n\nposterior cerebral arteries and intermittent development of moderate mid-segment\n\nstenosis of the basilar artery. Bloodwork 2/27: SMA7 normal, except glucose 134. 8/30\n\nbili, total protein, albumin, globulin within normal limits. LFT's normal except SGOT\n\nelevated at 46. \n\n\n\nIMPRESSION: 72-year-old female with diabetes, chronic hepatitis C and\n\nhypertension, complaining of basically veering of her gait and feeling unsteady. She is\n\nsymptomatic only when she walks. Her exam is notable for mild vibratory loss in the\n\ntoes, likely due to diabetic neuropathy, bilateral lower-extremity dysmetria and the\n\nwide-based, at times veering gait. It appears that her gait difficulties with veering  are\n\nmultifactorial, due to history of multiple lacunar infarcts and peripheral neuropathy.\n\nIt does not appear that these episodes are due to transient ischemic attacks, given\n\nthat she veered in the office while walking and stated that this was the symptom she\n\nis concerned about.  However, given her mid-segment basilar stenosis seen on MRI,\n\nshe certainly could become symptomatic from this down the road, particularly if she\n\nbecame hypotensive. As she was unable to tolerate Aggrenox, will try adding\n\nPersantine at a lower dose at 25 mg b.i.d., along with an aspirin per day, to see if she\n\ncan tolerate gradually increased doses of Persantine. I will see her in follow up in two\n\nmonths to see how she is doing. May also consider checking CBC, given her\n\nsymptoms of fatigue and other bloodwork should these symptoms persist. \n\n\n\nHope Kincaid, M.D.\n\n\n\nCC: Julie Fraser, M.D.\n\n\n\nHK/crane/kang\nRecord date: 2094-05-08\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNAME:    Wilson, Gabriel\n\nMRN:     8514931\n\n\n\nThe patient is a 73-year-old woman with a history of diabetes, hypertension,\n\nhyperlipidemia and multiple other medical problems. She has a history of TIAs and\n\nwas seeing the neurologist today for follow up. She has not had recent TIA symptoms\n\nbut related a history of exertional chest pain and was sent up here for evaluation.\n\nGriggs was translating and the patient reports that over the past two months she\n\nhas been getting chest pain and pressure with some shortness of breath after she\n\nwalks about one block. The symptom is a pressure symptom which radiates to both\n\nsides of her chest. It is not severe, sharp chest pain. It does not radiate to her back.\n\nThere is no associated rest pain or nocturnal pain. No PND, orthopnea or edema.\n\nThe last time she had the pain was two weeks ago. She has a history of TIAs and our\n\ngoal was to keep her blood pressure in the 140-160 range since they may be due to a\n\nlow flow state due to her vertebrobasilar disease.\n\n\n\nShe is on aspirin and Plavix.\n\n\n\nShe had a negative sestamibi ETT in 2087 except she had a very low work capacity.\n\nShe has not had a recent stress test.  \n\n\n\nPHYSICAL EXAM: She is a very pleasant woman in no acute distress. Her blood\n\npressure is 160/70. Neck supple without JVD or bruits. Lungs clear without wheezes,\n\nrales or rhonchi. Cardiac: Rate regularly regular, normal S1, S2, no diastolic murmur\n\nor gallop. Abdomen soft, nontender without hepatosplenomegaly. No edema.  \n\n\n\nHer EKG shows normal sinus rhythm. \n\n\n\nASSESSMENT AND PLAN:  Patient with multiple cardiac risk factors and a story\n\nwhich sounds convincing for exertional angina. She has not had any symptoms in over\n\ntwo weeks. Will add low-dose Lopressor 12.5 mg p.o. b.i.d. She should stop it if she\n\nfeels lightheaded on the medication. She should increase the aspirin to 325 q.d. We\n\nwill schedule her for a sestamibi ETT. She will follow-up in one week.\n\n\n\n\n\nJulie Fraser, M.D.\n\n\n\nJF/crane/powell\nRecord date: 2097-06-28\n\n\n\nVisit Note\n\n\n\nPatient Name: WILSON, GABRIEL                        MRN: 8514931\n\nDictated Date: 06/29/2097                      Dictated By: Julie Fraser, M.D.\n\n\n\nDate of Visit: 06/28/2097\n\n\n\n\n\n Patient is a 76-year-old Croatian woman who came in today. Her daughter Gibbs was translating. She is a very complicated 76-year-old Croatian woman with a history of diabetes, hypertension, vertebral basilar insufficiency, chronic hepatitis B and other medical problems. She is status post a right Bell's palsy in the past. \n\n\n\nRecently she has been sometimes living at her daughter's house and other times at her niece's house. They are trying to provide more support in terms of regulating that she takes her medication. When she stays at her daughter's Gibbs's house her daughter does check her sugars though her niece does not. Her blood pressure has been very labile recently and we recently added hydrochlorothiazide and nifedipine extended release 30 mg every day to her regimen in addition to her regular Cozaar and Toprol. Her daughter also has increased her insulin/70/30 to 48 units in the morning. She thinks that sometimes in the afternoon or late afternoon she may have some low sugars. She reports that her mother feels dizzy and has difficulty moving her left leg if her sugar gets low. She feels better if she is given orange juice or something to eat. She has had similar symptoms to that with low sugars in the past however when the daughter checks her sugars they are all in the 174 to 225 range. She has occasional sugars before bedtime that are 337 and 249. The lowest sugar she had was 88 before dinner. \n\n\n\nThe patient reports that she feels dizzy at times. She is a very difficult historian even with her daughter translating or with the other interpreters translating. She has not been having any chest pain or palpitations. Her dizziness is not related to standing up or lying down. No syncope, slurred speech, spinning dizziness, diplopia, or focal arm or leg weakness or numbness. \n\n\n\nOf note the chest pain she had complained about on the last visit when her daughter had noted she was cleaning has resolved. \n\n\n\nHer cardiac stress test from June 2094 showed an exercise capacity of 4 METS, EKG nondiagnostic due to submaximal heart rate response. No evidence for ischemia on the perfusion images. From March 2095 her vascular lab studies showed normal distal vertebral arteries and basilar arteries throughout its length. She also had carotid studies March 2095 that showed minimal disease of the right and left carotid. Her prior MRI from 07/95 showed chronic lacunar infarcts but no acute hemorrhage or infarct. \n\n\n\nThe patient has had chronic slow speech and there is question about whether or not she has dementia. Her daughter is giving her the Aricept though it is not clear if this is benefiting her or not. Sometimes her daughter thinks that she is actually just being stubborn or uncooperative rather than having difficulties with her memory though other times it seems as if she she does have some dementia. \n\n\n\nShe also has been followed in Glancy Memorial Hospital. \n\n\n\nOn exam she is in no acute distress. Blood pressure 124/60. Neck: Supple without JVD or bruits. Lungs: Clear without wheezes, rales, or rhonchi. Cardiac: Rate regularly regular, normal S1, S2 without S3, S4, or murmurs. Abdomen: Soft, nontender. No CCE. She has chronic right facial weakness consistent with her known Bell's palsy. Cranial nerves 2 through 12 otherwise intact though vision was not assessed. Motor 5/5. Reflexes 1+, absent ankle jerks, downgoing toes. Gait is slightly wide based which is consistent with the prior note from Dr. Hope Kincaid. Sensation intact to light touch. Distal pulses intact. \n\n\n\n1. Hypertension which is much better controlled on current regimen. Continue same. Check Chem-7. \n\n\n\nType 2 diabetes. Her daughter attributes some of her lightheadedness to hypoglycemia but the documented sugars are not at all low. Ideally we would correlate her symptoms with a fingerstick sugar. \n\n\n\nLightheadedness and dizziness.

There was initial concern for TB, but she ruled out for pulmonary tb with 3 negative smears. PPD positive. \n\nShe had an MRI of her spine that was initially read as L5/S1 diskitis/osteomyelitis with right paraspinal phlegmon . MSK radiologists felt that this actually represented degenerative change with no evidence of infection, with explanation that a large right-sided osteophyte is causing irritation. \n\nMrs. Iles declined a TEE on during her admission. \n\nShe was treated with streptomycin IM q daily x 2 weeks,and concurrent doxycycline 100 mg po bid plus rifampin 300 mg po tid. \n\nShe was seen in ID clinic on 7/20, 9/7, 11/9, and today (1/4/81). She has improved dramatically, and is able to walk independently without pain. She has no fevers, night sweats, weight loss, nausea, or vomiting.

She presented with a syndrome of constitutional symptoms and back pain of 3 months duration, and has improved dramatically after 2 weeks of streptomycin IM (completed), rifampin 300 mg po tid, and doxycycline 100 mg po bid. Her antibiotics started on 6/4/80 and will be discontinued today 1/4/81 after 6 months of therapy. \n\nShe was counseled today that she is to watch out for recurrence of infection, which may include fever, night sweats, weight loss, anorexia, worsening back pain, and fatigue. She knows to contact us should this occur. \n\nShe was counseled to not drink unpasteurized camel milk.\n\nIn addition, Mrs Iles is PPD positive: she has completed the required 4 months of therapy for latent TB (she had 6 months) as part of the treatment of her Brucella infection. \n\nAll Allergies Reviewed\n\t\n\nMs. Iles was seen and examined with Dr. Tillman. Her back pain, fevers, and weight loss have entirely resolved. She has finished six months of doxy/rif and should stop these medications.

He had some purulent D/C from rectum and worsening of glucose control.  He was seen in EDUCARE-PULLMAN Urgent Care on 1/21/77 at which time a small erythematous and tender cyst was noted between his buttocks.  He was prescribed sitz baths and Keflex for pilonidol cyst vs. ruptured boil.  He was seen again in EDUCARE-PULLMAN on 1/29/77 at which time he reported resolution of his buttock pain.  He denied fevers or neurologic symptoms.  Exam was notable for only a tiny pustule in the upper gluteal cleft, minimally erythematous, non-tender, without drainage.  On the morning of 2/01/77 he developed worsening of his shortness of breath, followed by the development of left jaw pain, and cold sweats, so he presented to the MANAMANA ED.  On presentation, he also admitted to three days of scrotal and perineal pain and swelling.  In the ED he was tachycardic to 113, normotensive, initially low-grade fever, but later spiked to 102.9.  On examination, there was severe bilateral testicular swelling and pain, with a fluctuant mass between the rectum and scrotum.  His WBC was 18,000 with 91% PMNs.  An abdominal CT revealed extensive subcutaneous edema in the perineum, with multiple foci of air consistent with a necrotizing infection; and extensive fluid in the scrotum, consistent with Fournier's gangrene.  The patient was treated with IV Abx and was taken urgently to the OR, where he underwent extensive debridement at which time substantial necrosis and pus were discovered.  He was admitted to the SICU and has since undergone multiple debridements, last on 2/20/77.\n\nIn terms of his DM, he has type 2 diagnosed in October 2075.  At the time he was feeling \"lousy,\" tired, nauseated, and increased urinary frequency: went to Payson Hospital and FS was 376.  Pt was admitted overnight and given insulin; started on Metformin 500 bid, eventually insulin was added.  He was being followed by Dr. Talley at the Promptcare but stopped going there.  Most recently treated with Lantus 50 units at bedtime plus maximal doses of Glipizide 10 bid and Metformin 1000 bid, with uncontrolled HbA1c (see below).  He has microalbuminuria.  He is unable to give me a full history.\n\nIn the SICU he has been treated with an insulin drip, which oscillates between 4-11 U/hr.  He is being fed with Glucerna continuous TF at 120 cc/hr, and has been started on NPH 50 U q12h.   \n\n\nPMH:\n1. DM-2\n2. HTN\n3. Mixed dyslipidemia\n4. Depression\n5. Obesity\n6. Back pain\n7.

Considering his current requirement of at least 120 U IV/24h on top of his SQ doses, he will probably need close to 100 U q12h.  Could safely increase his NPH to 80 U q12h right now.\n\nWould make sure that in the Instructions to this order it's written to hold NPH if TF stop for any reason, and start D10W @ 50 cc/hr for 12h after the last NPH dose if that happens.\n\nRecommend:\n1. Increase NPH to 80 U q12h\n2. Titrate NPH doses upwards by 10 U q12h each dose as long as czi drip is needed\n3. Please make sure that in the Instructions to the NPH order it's written to hold NPH if TF stop for any reason, and start D10W @ 50 cc/hr for 12h after the last NPH dose (especially if pt transfers to floor)\n4. Would consider reintroducing ACEi for kidney protection into his BP regimen (e.g. Lisinopril 10 mg daily)\n5. Pt will likely need fibrate for hypertriglyceridemia as he improves\n\nThank you for interesting consult\nDr. Tan will follow\n\t\n\nUriel J.

Dr. Prince had arranged involuntary hospitalization for this pt with campus security and EMS, prior to his arrival for the appointment.  However, per Mr. Vaughn, he arrived to the appointment only with the expectation of discussing his depression and refilling his Celexa, which he has been unable to take for the past 2 weeks, due to an expired prescription.  Dr. Prince documents a discussion in which the pt was tearful and emotional, while describing active suicidal ideation with a plan to overdose on oxycodone.  He reportedly had several episodes this past week, where he had more than a hundred oxycodone pills in his hand, but did not follow through on his plans.  Given concern for imminent danger, a Section 12 was completed, and pt was transferred to the MANAMANA ED.  \n\n\nThe pt does admit to phobias of the hospital, and strong desire to avoid admission.  However, he states that his last suicidal ideation was approximately 2 weeks ago, and that he changed his mind, once he realized his mother&#8217;s soon-to-be ex-husband, who has been threatening her, will be released from prison soon.  Moreover, he states that he has been taking all his medications, checking his insulin at least four times a day for his sliding scale, and changing the dressings on his sacral and scrotal wounds, with intent to improving his health.\n\n\nThe Medical Service was asked to evaluate the pt for active and impending medical issues prior to admission to a Psychiatry Service. \n\n\nPMH/PSH\n1. Depression:  Symptoms since age 12.\n2. IDDM2:  Diagnosed at age 18.  Was previously on oral hypoglycemics, but now on insulin.

Pt does have hypertension, IDDM2, hyperlipidemia, and open wounds near his scrotum and sacrum.  All of these medical issues appear to be stable, although their management could be fine-tuned via an outpatient basis.  Hypertension is being managed appropriately with a betablocker (HCTZ caused hyponatremia), but given his history of microalbuminuria, he should also be on an ACE-I or ARB.  His history of hypertriglyceridemia was persistent, even in the setting of insulin for DM2 and improved glycemic control.  He would also benefit from restarting a fibrate, such as Lopid.  His DM2 is quite stable, as pt reports FS of 100 to 200 at home with his current insulin regimen.  The wounds should be evaluated by his Surgical Team through his outpatient appointments.  His last evaluation by General Surgery just 2 days ago showed significant improvement, with recommendations of BID dressing changes as the pt is currently doing.\nRECOMMENDATIONS:\n1. Continue Toprol XL 100mg PO once daily\n2. Continue NPH Insulin 30 units with breakfast and 10 units with dinner.  If pt is NPO, or refusing to eat a meal, please give only one-half the dose\n3. Continue his regular insulin sliding scale as outline in the Medication List with QAC and QHS fingerstick checks\n4. No concentrated sweets diet\n5. Start Lisinopril 10mg PO once daily\n6. Start Lopid 600mg PO BID (30 minutes before breakfast and dinner)\n7. Consider checking hemoglobin A1c and fasting lipid profile with reflex check of LDL for triglyceridemia\n8. Dry sterile dressing changes to his scrotal and sacral wounds TID and PRN if dressing is soaked\n9. Will defer antidepressive medication regimen to Psychiatry Service\n\n\nCase and plan discussed in detail with Medical Consult Attending, Dr. Hector Bennett.  \n\n\n\n\n_____________________________\nUlysses Jurado, M.D.   Pager #34621\nMANAMANA Medical SAR\nRecord date: 2078-03-26\n\n\n\n\n\nGrace Cottage Surgery Service\nConsult Note\n\n\nPatient:  Vaughn, Frank\nMRN:  6767510\nDate: 3/26/78\n\n\nCC:  Cellulitis of abdominal pannus\n\n\nHPI:  Mr. Vaughn is a 33 yo diabetic male with a history of Fournier&#8217;s gangrene s/p multiple debridements and diverting colostomy in January 2077 who was recently admitted to the LH service 3/15-3/16/78 for cellulitis of his abdominal pannus.

Surgical sutures in the anterior abdominal wall. There is a superficial soft tissue mass in the subcutaneous tissue of the left anterior abdominal wall, slightly larger on the current study measuring approximately 3.3 cm. There are mild degenerative changes involving the thoracic and lumbar spine.\n\n\nProcedure note: The area of induration on the left side of the patient&#8217;s pannus was prepped with betadine. 5cc of 1% lidocaine without epinephrine was infiltrated into the area. A 2cm incision was made over the area of fluctuance and approximately 8cc of purulent thick fluid was expressed. A culture of the abscess fluid was sent. The wound was probed gently to break up any loculations. The wound was then packed with &#188; inch dry packing tape. A dry sterile dressing was applied. The patient tolerated the procedure well. \n\n\nImpression/Plan: 33 year old diabetic male with history of Fournier&#8217;s gangrene s/p multiple debridements and diverting colostomy presents with recurrent cellulitis and abscess of the left side of his pannus.

Longstanding insulin-dependent adult onset diabetes with a history of neuropathy and retinopathy.\n\n2.  History of lower extremity edema with past evaluation per patient including a normal stress echocardiogram.\n\n3.  History of low back pain due to degenerative disc disease.  The patient has been treated at the Bryan W Whitfield Memorial Hospital  with treatments including facet blocks and epidural injections.\n\n4.  Status post cholecystectomy.\n\n5.  Status post four vaginal deliveries, two cesarean sections and two miscarriages.\n\n8.  Hypothyroidism.\n\n9.  Former smoker approximately 15-pack-year history quit seven years ago.\n\n10.  Hypertension.\n\n\n\nHISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient has a longstanding history of diabetes.  She has required retinal laser surgery for retinopathy.  She reports some tingling and numbness in the bottom of her feet.  She has had debilitating problems with lower extremity swelling over the last 18 months.  She notes that an extensive evaluation was initially done without a clear explanation.  Her endocrinologist had her stop her Actos which resulted in significant improvement.  Over the last six months, however, the patient has developed leg swelling again.  She denies paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea.  She does note some exertional shortness of breath, which she attributes to her weight.  She has no history of exertional chest pain.  She has not noted a change in her abdominal girth.  She has had no calf pain or swelling.  She does note a history of sleep apnea and restless leg syndrome.  The patient notes that she had a sleep study at some point in the past two or three years ago.  A CPAP device was recommended but not tolerated by the patient.  She notes that she has significant daily low back pain.  Her average pain is 8-9/10.  This occurs while she is standing or walking any distance.  She has very little or no pain when she is sitting or lying.\n\n\n\nREVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  Otherwise, unremarkable with no fever, chills, change in bowel habits, constipation, diarrhea, black or bloody stools, dysuria, skin rash.  The patient does have exertional leg cramps.  She notes a vascular evaluation was normal and her pain was felt due to her back.\n\n\n\nMEDICATIONS:  Norvasc 5 mg q.d., Bextra 20 mg q.d., Lipitor 20 mg q.d., lisinopril 40 mg q.d., atenolol 50 mg q.d., Flonase one spray each nostril q.d., quinine 324 mg q.h.s. p.r.n., aspirin 81 mg q.d., insulin, Humulin N 40 units b.i.d., Humalog sliding scale 15 to 25 units q.a.m. 15 to 25 units before dinner, levothyroxine 150 mcg q.a.m.\n\n\n\nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Vital signs: Weight 284 pounds, temperature 98.2, heart rate 68, blood pressure 140/64.  The patient is in no distress, breathing comfortably.  HEENT: Anicteric, no oral lesions.  Neck: Supple, no lymphadenopathy, no thyroid mass or nodule.  Lungs: Clear to auscultation.  No wheeze, rales or rhonchi.  Cardiac: Regular.  Distant heart sounds.  No murmur, rub or gallop.  Abdomen: Obese, soft, no mass.  Normoactive bowel tones.  Extremities: 2+ edema to the knees.  Vascular: Carotid pulses are strong and symmetric without bruit.  Radial, dorsalis pedis and posterior tibial pulses are strong and symmetric.\n\n\n\nASSESSMENT AND PLAN:\n\n1.  Edema.  The patient's edema is likely multifactorial.  She does not have evidence of congestive heart failure today.  I reviewed her dietary sodium intake, which sounds to be acceptable.  She may benefit from additional nutrition counseling regarding this issue.  Her leg swelling may also relate to her Norvasc use.  I did not see her urine microalbumin testing and laboratory studies the patient brings with her today.  Significant proteinuria may be contributing to her edema as well.  The patient has had no reactions to sulfa medications and has never been on a thiazide diuretic to her knowledge.  I recommended initially that she stop the Norvasc and start hydrochlorothiazide 25 mg q.d.  I discussed the use and side effects of this medication.  I will see her back in the office in two or three weeks to review her progress.\n\n2.  Low back pain. I recommend the patient continue her Bextra.  We discussed other pain medications including narcotics.  We elected against using these medications today.\n\n3.  History of sleep apnea.  The patient has significant fatigue.  This may be due to her sleep apnea.  In addition, her difficulty with her weight as well as fluid retention may relate to her poorly controlled sleep apnea.  I discussed this with her today.  I would recommend that she return for a follow up sleep study.  She did not have good luck with a sleep mask but might do better with a nasal mask.  She will think about this and we will review it again on her follow up visit.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n______________________________\n\nRoger York, M.D.\n\n\n\n\n\nDictated By: Roger York\n\n\n\n\n\neScription document:4-6557064 Dana Vaughn\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDD: 08/27/60\n\nDT: 08/28/60\n\nDV: 08/27/60\nRecord date: 2061-07-15\n\n\n\nReason for Visit\n\nThis is a  65 year old  female referred to the diabetes management service for poorly  controlled diabetes\n\n\n\nChief Complaint\n\nThis patient is admitted to the hospital for lap gastric banding\n\n\n\nHistory of Present Illness\n\nThe patient has  history of Type 2 diabetes.

She comes in today with her husband and daughter.  (Her daughter is her legal healthcare proxy.)  They come in to follow up on a recent hospitalization at Mid Coast Hospital.  In January, she was noted by her family to be agitated and confused.  She was missing her medication or taking too much medication at times, including her insulin.  She also became paranoid when efforts were made to intervene to assist her.  Her family notes that this seemed to begin after her gabapentin dose was increased to 600 mg bid.  She was also taking some other drugs at the time that affect the central nervous system, including trazodone, benzodiazepines, and narcotics for back pain.  She was admitted to the geriatric psychiatry unit at Mid Coast in January 2065.  She stayed there for almost a week.  According to the family, some medications were discontinued and donepazil was started.  Also, they think she had a brain MRI.  She improved and was ultimately discharged.  She has done much better since discharge.  She went with family to Michigan.  They report that there she was much better, playing water volleyball last week.  Her husband is now supervising her medications.  He still notices some memory loss, but this has improved since her discharge.  She has had frequent headaches.  She has noted no urinary incontinence and no worsening of her gait.\n\n\nAccording to available notes, drugs stopped during her hospitalization include gabapentin, trazodone, metformin, HCTZ, Hunulin, and Lispro.  She is back no the metformin and HCTZ.\n\n\nHer current medications are: aspirin 81 mg daily, Celebrex, donepazil 5 mg daily, HCTZ, linsinopril, labetalol, Crestor, insulin, pramipexole 0.125 mg qhs, Protonix, Roxicet, L-thyroxine, temazepam qhs, and metformin.  She is allergic to erythromycin.\n\n\nOn examination today pulse is 60 and regular.  BP is 104/60.  She is alert and oriented to time, except the precise date.  She is aware that yesterday was Tuesday.  She is oriented to place.  Her mental and motor responses are slightly slow.  She displays an appropriate sense of humor.  She attends well.  She recites the months of the year promptly forwards and backwards. She registers 4 of 4 words.  She recalls 3/4 at one minutes and the 4th with a semantic clue with a slight error \"14 Massachusetts Drive\" rather than 24 Massachusetts Drive.  At 5 minutes, she recalls all 4 with only the error, \"14 Massachusetts Drive\" but with no need for a clue.  At 10 minutes, she recalls 2/4 without any clue, the 3rd with a semantic hint, and the 4th with a semantic hint again as \"14 Massachusetts Drive.\"  She readily adds a simple sum in her head.  She follows multiple step commands.  She copies interlocking pentagons and a 3D cube well with only slight 3D perspective distortion.  She constructs a clock well with good planning and no neglect.  \n\n\nVisual fields are full.  Pupils are 2.5 mm and reactive.  Fundi are not well visualized.  There rest of the cranial nerves are intact.  Muscle bulk, tone, and power are normal.  There are not extrapyramidal features, and there is no paratonia.  Reflexes are damp in the arms and absent at the ankles (UE 1/4, knees 2/4, ankles 0/4) and symmetric.  Plantar responses are flexor.  Romberg is negative.  She walks without hesitation in gait initiation.  Her stride is reasonably good,  Her base is only slightly widened.  She tandem walks with moderate unsteadiness.  \n\n\nThe examination has not changed much from her visit in October 2063.  She has some problems with memory by examination, but this seems to have improved greatly since her hospitalization.  Her confusion and reported paranoia seem to have gone away. Except or mild psychomotor slowing, she does not have features to suggest NPH as the cause, such as urinary incontinence or magnetic gait.  I suspect that her recent deterioration was due to adverse reaction to psychoactive medication that has now been discontinued of limited.\n\n\nWe will make no change in medication today.  We will request the recent MRI from Mid Coast.  She will return in several weeks after we have gotten the MRI.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUriah Yousif, M.D.\n\n\ncc: Roger York, M.D.\n      454 Prospect Street\n      Sleepy Eye, NC 77659\nRecord date: 2065-12-19\nEDVISIT^60244986^XIAN, BROOKLYN^12/19/65^QUAGLIA, BRONSON\n\nI confirm that I have interviewed and examined the patient and\n\nreviewed the PA's documentation.

Her hemoglobin A1c is 11.1.  We discussed her current system for managing her blood sugar.  She notes 100% compliance in using her NPH insulin, 45 units in the morning, 40 in the evening.  She is taking 2 shots of Humalog, on average, in the morning and just before bedtime.  She is doing 2 fingersticks a day, in the morning fasting and before bed.  She notes recent indiscretions in terms of her calorie intake.  She checked her fingerstick this morning, but cannot remember the result.  She is fully compliant with her other medications.  She was on simvastatin in the past, which was stopped because of liver test elevations.  She was on Crestor in the past, which was stopped at the time of a hospitalization when her CK was noted to be elevated.  Today, she is having no fever, chest pain, shortness of breath, abdominal pain, dysuria, leg swelling, or leg numbness.\n\n\nMedications\nAricept (DONEPEZIL Hcl) 5 MG (5MG TABLET Take 1) PO QPM #30 Tablet(s)\nAsa (ACETYLSALICYLIC Acid) 81MG TABLET EC Take 1 Tablet(s) PO QD #90 Tablet(s)\nCelebrex (CELECOXIB) 200 MG (200MG CAPSULE Take 1) PO QD #30 Capsule(s)\nGlucagon Emergency Kit (GLUCAGON Hcl) 1 MG (1MG VIAL Take 1) SC x1, use as needed for low blood sugar #1 VIAL\nHctz (HYDROCHLOROTHIAZIDE) 50 MG (25MG TABLET Take 2) PO QD as directed x 30 days #60 Tablet(s)\nHumalog Insulin (INSULIN Lispro) 15 UNITS SC ac x 90 days #3 Month(s) Supply\nInsulin Nph Human 45 UNIT S AM AND 40 PM SC AM and QHS x 90 days #3 Month(s) Supply\nLabetalol Hcl 200 MG (100MG TABLET Take 2) PO BID #120 Tablet(s)\nLevothyroxine Sodium 125 MCG (125MCG TABLET Take 1) PO qd x 90 days #90 Tablet(s)\nLisinopril 40 MG (40MG TABLET Take 1) PO QD x 30 days #30 Tablet(s)\nMirapex (PRAMIPEXOLE) 0.125MG TABLET PO as directed PRN as directed, 1-4 tab #120 Tablet(s)\nOxycodone 5 MG (5 MG TABLET Take 1) PO Q6H PRN pain, May increase to 2 PO QID if needed for pain. #180 Tablet(s)\nTemazepam 30 MG (30MG CAPSULE Take 1) PO QHS prn, caution causes sedation x 30 days #30 Capsule(s)\n\n\nAllergies\nErythromycins - Itching\nSIMVASTATIN - elevates liver enzymes\nAMITRIPTYLINE HCL - urinary retention\nGABAPENTIN - memory loss\n\n\nVital Signs\nBP 126/68 L Arm, P 69, Temp 98.0, Wt 235.0 lb\n\n\n\n\nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  The patient is in no distress.  Her initial blood pressure, as she walked down the hall, was 154/71.  Repeating this after sitting was 126/68.  Lungs:  Clear.  Cardiac:  Regular.  Extremities:  Trace edema.\n\n\n\nASSESSMENT:  Uncontrolled adult onset diabetes.  Care for this will be challenging due to the patient's cognitive problems.  She does use Valley Hospital Web Services.  We discussed to start frequent communication via Web Services of test results will be helpful for me in helping her adjust insulin.  We discussed the possibility of changing from NPH to Lantus insulin, but elected to continue her NPH for now.  We discussed that her use of the ultra-fast acting insulin does not quite make sense.  She is taking an injection in the evening, long after her meal.  I asked her to describe her meals and she has carbohydrates essentially with every meal.  I think initially she can easily tolerate 10 units of Humalog with each meal.  She notes that she prefers to inject the insulin after she eats, which is acceptable as long she does it within a few minutes of the meal.  She currently is using an average of 15 units, so this will increase her total daily insulin use by just 15 units.  I asked her to check 3 fingersticks a day for me and to e-mail them on a daily basis to start.  She will check a fasting fingerstick.  She will check a fingerstick before her evening meal, which is her largest meal of the day.  She will check a fingerstick 2 hours after her evening meal.  She does not need to check a fingerstick right before bed.  She will stop using Humalog right before bed and only use the NPH at that time.  We discussed the importance of cholesterol treatment.  Her last LDL was over 100.  I would like to revisit the idea of using a statin.  I will repeat her CK level to see if this remains elevated.  Her blood pressure on recheck is acceptable.  I will see her back in the office in 2 months rather than what is booked now.  Most of our visit today took place together with her husband.  We spent a total of 25 minutes with more than half the time spent in counseling.\n\n\n\n\n\n______________________________\n\nRoger York, M.D.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\neScription document:6-48975237 TC567\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDD: 02/12/67\n\nDT: 02/12/67\n\nDV: 02/12/67"}

Had been on Atenolol and Zestril but pt self-D/C'd Zestril several wks ago because she thought the Zestril made her feel nauseated. Since then, has had gradually developing DOE   from baseline of walking over 4-5 flights of stairs without difficulty to dyspnea on only a flight of stairs. She underwent L knee arthroscopy for medial meniscal tear on 11/19/78 without immediate complications. At 3 am that night, though, woke up with severe dyspnea, with some relief upon sitting up. Associated with some wheezing; tried some of husband's nebs   only slight relief. Later over the day, dyspnea worsened to the point that only few steps would make short of breath. Some association with non-radiating substernal chest tightness in evening; no N/V, lightheadness, diaphoresis, or pleuritic CP, F/S/C, or cough. Next day, dyspnea persisted so pt came into ED.\n\n\n\nIn ED, found to have BP of 230's/120's, satting 70's on RA. CTA PE-protocol showing no PE or DVT but with pulm edema and bibasilar atelectasis vs. PNA (unlikely).

She is less depressed, more upbeat.  Now a year since her father's death (? drug overdose).\n\n\n\nShe is on tapering prednisone after her severe rejection for noncompliance. She has multiple access problems, history of seizures, and severe hyperparathyroidism.  \n\n\n\nMedications:  Her meds include Prednisone 2 mg in the a.m., Nephrocaps, Prilosec 20 q.d., Midodrine 5 mg only before dialysis, Diltanin 400 mg b.i.d., Tegretol 250 b.i.d., Renagel 4 caps at breafast, lunch, dinner, 3 capsules with snacks plus 2 tablespoons Alternagel, Doxepin 50 q.h.s., Coumadin 5 mg, Xanax 4-5 tablets of 0.5 q.d., Celexa 20.\n\n\n\nAllergies:  She has allergies to Cipro, Demerol, penicillin, and gets red man syndrome from Vanco if given rapidly.  \n\n\n\nShe has seasonal allergies and takes Zyrtec 10 mg, Flonase 2 sprays each nostril, Albuterol 2 puffs 4x a day as needed, and Advair 2 puffs as needed.\n\n\n\nSocial History:  She is taking 1 course at computer school.\n\n\n\nPhysical Examination: Her blood pressure was 170/90 - this is much higher for her.  She has conjunctival injection, which is her acute red eye of uremia.  Neck is supple.  Carotid upstroke is normal.  Thyroid is not enlarged.  Chest is clear. She is chronically ill appearing.  She has an S4, no S3.  Abdomen is soft, nontender.  Bowel sounds are normal.  She has a graft in her leg.  She as 1+ to 2+ edema. She has been gaining 4 kg in the interdialytic period.\n\n\n\nImpression:  Blood pressure is up.  Hold the Midodrine, readjust her dry weight.  She claims it is 45 kg, I think it may be lower.  May need antihypertensives if blood pressure remains elevated. Reinforced the need for calcium/phosphorus management.

Bowel sounds are normal. Extremity \n\n     1+ edema. \n\n     \n\nIMPRESSION: end stage renal disease on hemodialysis, seizure\n\n     disorder thrombosed A-V fistula, volume overload.\n\n\n\nHOSPITAL COURSE: The patient underwent revision of her left upper arm A-V fistulae by Dr. Schmitt\n\nOn 8/30/86 without complications. Because her arm was swollen her subsequent dialysis was done \n\nUtilizing a temporary femoral dialysis catheter. She was noted to be persistently anemic with a \n\nHematocrit of 23.3% on 9/05/86. It was felt that her low hematocrit was due to both blood loss from\n\nPersistent severe menorrhagia as well as a dilutional component from fluid overload. She was electively \n\ntransfused 2 units of packed cells on 9/05/86 while on dialysis utilizing her revised A-V fistulae. \n\nThe rest of her hospital course was uneventful. She was hyperphosphatemic in hospital and was given dietary counseling for use of her phosphate binders.

Her poorly controlled HTN, LE edema and rales \nmake flash pulmonary edema another consideration.  \nDespite her lack of a significant smoking history she had emphasematous changes on prior chest CT scans \nand so could be at risk for a COPD exacerbation but she had good air movement w/o wheezes.  Her face appears slightly swollen and she has had SVC syndrome in the past but her facial swelling is likely related to her steroids, she has only mild venous distention on her chest and she claims her fascial swelling is not worse then usual.\n&#224;Agree w/ lasix 60 mg iv BID (but pt may be preload dependent w/ such severe pulm htn so we have to avoid volume depleting her)\n&#224;V/Q scan and LE dopplers\n&#224;If no PE and not better w/ lasix then will need to consider chest CT w/ IV contrast to r/o SVC syndrome and parechymal lund problems.\n&#224;When pt feeling better I would check full PFTS to evaluate pulm htn and possibility of COPD.

Approximately\n\nfour weeks ago, he started noting visual changes.  He saw colored\n\nspots floating in his visual field.  He has been noting some\n\ndecreased depth perception and visual acuity.  At the same time,\n\nhe has been getting throbbing unilateral headaches, which he\n\nbelieves were migraines.  He saw an ophthalmologist at Mediquik who told him that his eye exam was within normal limits.\n\n He was then referred to Dr. Gill for neurologic evaluation. \n\nDr. Gill did not note any significant neurologic deficits. \n\nHowever, during his workup, he did check a hemoglobin A1c, which\n\ncame back at 10.2.  Of note, the last time I saw the patient, I\n\nhad sent him a letter stating that his glucose was slightly\n\nelevated and asking him to return for a fasting glucose.  He\n\nnever returned for that testing.\n\n\n\nPAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Hypertension, hypercholesterolemia,\n\nobesity, and gout.\n\n\n\nMEDICATIONS:  HCTZ 50 mg p.o. q.d.,  Atenolol 50 mg p.o. b.i.d.,\n\nallopurinol 300 mg p.o. q.d.\n\n\n\nALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.\n\n\n\nFAMILY HISTORY:  Negative for diabetes but positive for kidney\n\nfailure.  This is thought to be due to glomerulonephritis.\n\n\n\nSOCIAL HISTORY:  He is a Graphic Arts Technician in Oconto.  He is\n\ncurrently on a leave of absence from work.  He is a nonsmoker.\n\n\n\nREVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  He believes that he has lost some weight over\n\nthe past four weeks but cannot quantify the amount.  He has been\n\nnoting anxiety symptoms, increased urinary frequency, and\n\nnocturia.  Otherwise, constitutional, HEENT, cardiac,\n\nrespiratory, GI, GU, musculoskeletal, neurologic, and\n\ndermatologic are negative.\n\n\n\nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  In general, he is a pleasant obese white\n\nman in no acute distress.  Vitals: Blood pressure 134/90, pulse\n\n66 and regular, and weight 249 pounds.  HEENT:  PERRL, EOMI,\n\nanicteric sclerae.  Clear oropharynx with dry mucous membranes. \n\nNeck is supple with no lymphadenopathy, no thyromegaly.  Chest: \n\nCTA&P bilaterally.  Heart: RRR, no MRG.  Abdomen:  Obese, soft,\n\nNT/ND, NABS, no HSM.  Extremities:  No CCE.  Neuro:  A&O x 3, 2+\n\nDTRs bilaterally.\n\n\n\nLABORATORY DATA: EKG shows normal sinus rhythm at 73 beats per\n\nminute, normal axis and intervals, no ST-T-wave changes.\n\n\n\nASSESSMENT AND PLAN:\n\n1.   Diabetes.  The patient was advised that his laboratory\n\ntesting and symptoms are all consistent with adult-onset\n\ndiabetes.  Given the severity of his symptoms, I have elected to\n\nstart him on metformin 500 mg p.o. q.d.  Use and side effects\n\nwere reviewed.  He will have Chem-7, urinary microalbumin and\n\nfasting lipid profile checked today.  Unfortunately, he was not\n\nactually fasting.  He will also be referred to Gretchen Drew and\n\nBertha Ely for further diabetic and nutritional education. \n\nHe will be started on lisinopril instead of  HCTZ.  He is asked\n\nto return in six weeks for follow up of his blood pressure.  He\n\nwas advised that his visual changes are likely due to lens\n\nswelling due to the uncontrolled diabetes.  I assume that this\n\nwill resolve as the blood sugars come under better control.  He\n\nwas given a written note regarding leave of absence from his job\n\nuntil his symptoms clear.\n\n2.  Migraines.  The patient does sound as if he is also having\n\nmigraines.  We will address this at future visits.\n\n\n\n\n\n______________________________\n\nPatti O.

Patient&#8217;s fall does appear to be mechanical by history. Her RCRI would be Class I-II, placing her at low to intermediate risk for this intermediate risk procedure. Given that she is on beta-blockade, she should be continued with use of short acting beta-blocker (i.e., lopressor) while here in the hospital. Her chronic venous stasis change is likely due to previous bilateral DVTs based on her history. This can be evaluated postoperatively as it may affect decisions regarding potential anticoagulation.\n\n\n\nRecommendations:\n\n-          Please change patient from atenolol to lopressor 37.5 mg PO Q8hours, to be held for HR &lt; 55 and SBP &lt; 100\n\n-          Please check ECG postoperatively along with troponin on Day 1 and Day 4 postoperatively\n\n-          Please implement high risk DVT prophylaxis postoperatively with lovenox 30 mg SC BID\n\n-          Please schedule LENIs postoperatively as is tolerated based on surgery. Would need to discuss benefits/risks of ongoing anticoagulation with family if positive\n\n\n\nThank you for this interesting consult. To be staffed today with Dr. Elliot Sexton.\n\n\n\n\n\n__________________________  6/29/2077 9:52 AM\n\nDaniel E.

She c/o of left femur pain and was unable to get up.  She denies hitting her head, CP, SOB.  She was found to have a displaced femoral neck fx on left and underwent an uneventful hemiarthroplasty; her post-op course was notable for Post-operative course was remarkable for LENIs on POD #2 found negative for DVT and 2-u pRBC transfusion for HCT of 23 with appropriate response.  She was discharged to MEDIQUIK on 7/2/77. \nOn the day prior to admission (7/12), the pt was noted to be fatigued by the rehab staff; she recalls feeling tired but &#8220;not too bad.&#8221;  Her hct was noted to have dropped from 30.4 &#224; 24.6 (baseline post-op hct ~30).  She was sent to the MARY ED, where she was tachy to the 100s, sBP 120s, guiaiac negative, and xray/CT revealed 750 cc fluid extending from the proximal third of the thigh to the hip, with Houdsfield units suggesting hematoma.  Pt denies dyspnea, CP, lightheadedness, fever, chills, sweats.  She received 1 unit pRBC (increase hct from 24.6&#224;28) and was admitted to Educare-Fargo A for further management.

On 11/15, patient was noted to have a decreased Hct, which was attributed to an expanding hematoma on her right thigh, and she was given 2 U of PRBCs from 9:30am-5pm on 11/15.  Overnight her O2 requirement increased from 2L to 4L, and she was given Lasix in response to a chest X-ray which showed signs of pulmonary edema.  Throughout the day patient became progressively more agitated, and in addition to her standing Seroquel (12.5 mg bid), she was also given two doses of Zyprexa (2.5mg and 5mg).  Overnight on 11/15-11/16 she became febrile, up to 103.5, peaking at 105.6 in the morning on 11/16, despite standing Tylenol.  Blood cultures and urine cultures were taken, and patient was started on Levoquin, Vancomycin and Ceftriaxone, and transferred to Team E.\n\n\n\nREVIEW OF SYSTEMS\n\nPer HPI\n\n\n\nPAST MEDICAL HISTORY\n\n\nDM &#8211; diet controlled\n \nHTN\n \nHypothyroidism\n \nHx of post-op DVT (&gt;40 years ago after a hysterectomy)\n \nFall with L hip fracture, s/p hemiarthroplasty\n\n\n\nPAST SURGICAL HISTORY\n\n\nHysterectomy\n \nL hemiarthroplasty\n\n\n\nRECENT DIAGNOSTIC STUDIES\n\nTTE (11/77)\n\nModerate mitral regurgitation, no aortic stenosis, trace regurgitation.

Differential includes infection, seizure, NMS or serotonin syndrome.  A temperature of 105.6 with no obvious infectious source does make infection seem less likely, however patient will be treated empirically with vancomycin, ceftriaxone and levoquin for possible hospital acquired aspiration pneumonia or meningitis.  An LP will be attempted if it can be safely done without compromising the patient&#8217;s respiratory status, and in the context of the patient&#8217;s tremor.  In the context of recently receiving Seroquel, Zyprexa and Fluoxetine, it is also possible that patient could have either serotonin syndrome or neuroleptic malignant syndrome, which could explain the patient&#8217;s elevated CK, elevated WBC, elevated LFTs, extremely high temperature and tremor with rigidity.\n\n\nContinue to follow lytes, CK, CBC\n \nSmall doses of Ativan for tremor/anxiety\n \nAVOID all neuroleptics (typical and atypical)\n \nContinue antibiotics, F/U cultures\n\n\n\nISSUE #2: Type III Dens fracture and pubic rami fracture.\n\n\nKeep in C collar, manage rami fracture medically\n\n\n\nISSUE #3: DM.

We are asked to consult for periop risk eval prior to ORIF.1. Periop cardiac risk: Pt&#8217;s RCRI is zero, and has no Hx CAD. Now, as she as in RVR to 140s, she has no ST depressions. Pt does not need periop beta blockade from a risk perspective, but should continue on home beta blockade given her HTN and now new AF.2. new AF: pt is now in new AF/RVR, asymptomatic, after missing her AM atenolol. She is getting 5mg IV lopressor plus 25 mg po lopressor in the ED, hopefully this will provide some rate control. She should continue on BB.- try 37.5 mg lopressor q8h; hold for HR &lt;60, SBP &lt;100- it is possible that arrhythmia may precipitate falls. She may benefit from a holter monitor as an outpatient, to see whether she is frequently in AF, or whether this was precipitated by illness and missing BB (more likely).- keep pt on tele while in house3. Hx NMS/serotonin syndrome: pt carries a dx of NMS from prior med use the last time she was hospitalized for hip surgery (see CAS notes 11/16/77). However, pt is elderly and with hx of dementia, is at risk for postop dementia. Given this, avoid anti-dopaminergic meds like haldol, seroquel, zydis/zyprexa, reglan. This pt tolerates small doses of benzo as a home med, therefore pt can try:- home klonopin 0.25mg po bid standing- ativan 0.5 mg q6h prn agitation- monitor for signs of NMS: mental status changes with muscle rigidity, fever, autonomic instability. Check CK if this happens and page med consult 06885 if any concerns.Thank you for this consult. We will follow with you.__________________________________Peggy Ellis, PGY-2 Pager #75412"}

Per notes, the pt was found to be unresponsive briefly after lunch, BP was checked and found to be in the 80&#8217;s systolic, EMS was activated and an IV was placed.  He quickly became responsive without intervention, and BP came up to the 80s/90s.  Per notes, no reported CP, abdominal pain, HA, LH, focal neurological symptoms, SOB, palpitations.  Of note, the pt was recently hospitalized at RCH 1/23 &#8211; 2/03/50 during which time he had labile BP&#8217;s including HTN as well as question of orthostasis, and was discharged on Hydralazine, HCTZ, Lisinopril, and Labetalol, after having taken only Atenolol and Terazosin on admission.  At rehab on 2/05 (3days PTA), his meds were changed to Atenolol, Terazosin, HCTZ, and Lisinopril.\n\n\nIn the ED, the pt&#8217;s vitals were T 96.4, HR 63, BP 98/53, RR 20, 95% on RA.  Labs sig for Na 129 (up to 131 after NS), Cr 1.58 (baseline 1.0 to 1.1 but recently 1.4 to 1.6), WBC 9.2 up to 15.6 (83% PMN) during time in the ED, Hct from 38.3 to 32.6 (MCV 85) in ED after fluids (guaiac negative), Head CT negative, CXR w/ slightly more prominent bibasilar L &gt; R opacities.  He also c/o cough while in the ED, w/ no other symptoms, w/ report of some rhonchorous breath sounds.  Two sets of blood cultures were drawn, he was given IVF (NS) at 120cc/hr, and he started on Vancomycin and Cefepime for presumed PNA.\n\n\nOn the floor, the pt complains of cough, mildly productive, but no fevers/chills, SOB, DOE, CP, hemoptysis, or any other sx, but is somewhat of a poor historian.  Of note, pt had recent chest CT (I+) on 1/27/50 to evaluate known RUL nodule, which showed likely aspiration PNA w/ multifocal dependent consolidation.  Pt initially was given 2days of Levofloxacin, but per Discharge Summary pt was not clinically behaving as if he had PNA, so Abx were stopped.\n\n\nPMH / PSH:\n-HTN (recent med adjustments as above)\n-Osteoarthritis w/ severe central canal stenosis, recent admission 1/50 w/ LUE weakness/ataxia, followed by NSG/Neuro, currently working w/ PT, in neck collar currently\n-RUL nodule first seen 2142, recent CT I+ on 1/27/50 showed \n-Left Thyroid nodule (1.7cm) noted on CT, unclear h/o any workup\n-BPH\n-Bronchiectasis in lingula, h/o remote ?thoracotomy as child\n-Chronic cough\n-Chronic mild thrombocytopenia\n\n\n\n\nMeds at Home: \n  1.

Will need to exonerate urine and blood as well; no meningismus on exam.  In terms of the hypotensive episode, likely in setting of mild hypovolemia plus several new BP meds from recent discharge, plus further titration at rehab in preceding few days.

As patient is currently very somnolent this history is based on phone interview with Ursula Jacks who is the HCP and is very involved with his father's care.  The patient was diagnosed with dementia by his PCP about 3 years ago and has been relatively stable living at home (on 2nd floor) in Keystone Heights with his wife who has been his primary caretaker; their two sons are very involved as well.  Over the last 6 months they have noticed increasing confusion, agitation, and labile emotions.  They noted he has been confused about location, time (recalls distant past but not recent past), and has occasionally not been able to identify his wife.  He has become emotionally labile and sometimes agitated.  His son notes that he recently had to physically force him to sit down and take his medications.  His wife has had to stay up at night to watch the patient to make sure he did not wander.  They are particularly worried about his ability to take the flight of stairs to their home since it takes him about 15 min to get up and appears unsteady. About 1 wk ago, while his wife was out of their home, he wandered out and locked himself out; when she returned he angrily accused her of locking him out.  Their mother has had increasing difficulty caring for him and has called the 2 sons for help daily for the past week.  They called his PCP about these accelerating changes and he was started on lorazepam 0.5-1mg Q4h prn which brought mild improvement.  Out of concern for his father's and mother's safety they brought him to the ED for evaluation and placement which their PCP has already begun to discuss with them.\n\n\nThey have not noticed fever/chills, nausea/vomiting, diarrhea/constipation (on aggressive regimen), complaints of pain, vision changes.

He was diagnosed with progressive shortness of breath in 2078.  He was treated with diuretics and other medications at that time.  He did quite well until December of last year when he had a cardiac arrest and underwent ICD placement.  He has had worsening symptoms over the last year with increasing shortness of breath on flat ground and a very severe shortness of breath with stairs.  He has had some episodic nature to this.  Two days prior to admission, he had relatively rapid onset of shortness of breath while trying to play pool.  This recurred several times associated with diaphoresis.  He had no palpitations at that time.  He has no chest discomfort.\n\nHis past medical history is significant for history of shower emboli and TIA in 2081.  He has diabetes.  He had spinal stenosis surgery in 2078.\n\nHis current medical regimen is Bumex 3, recently decreased from 12 due to worsening renal function.  He is on spironolactone described as 6.25 daily, digoxin 0.125, Toprol-XL 12.5.  He has been on carvedilol, which was changed due to dizziness.  He is on lisinopril 1.25 mg and has had great difficulty tolerating any higher dose due to dizziness.  He is on metolazone 2.5 weekly.  He takes Coumadin 7.5 mg most days.  He is on insulin and Lantus.  He has no known drug allergies.\n\nHis family history is essentially unremarkable.  Mother unknown, father had onset of angina in his 80s.  The patient lives with his wife and son and is a retired Fire Chief.  He had an 80-pack-year smoking history but quit four years ago.  He has one glass of alcohol every 1-2 weeks.\n\nReview of systems is negative for any problems with fevers, chills, change in his bowel or bladder habits.  He has no problems with swallowing.  He has no problems with hearing or vision.  Review of systems is otherwise negative.\n\nOn physical examination, blood pressure is 84/66 in the left arm and 86/62 in the right arm.  His chest is completely clear to auscultation and percussion.  Temperature is 35.9.  His heart rate is 100 and a regular rhythm.  His cardiac exam reveals left ventricular heave, which is visible.  He has a palpable and audible third heart sound.  The right ventricular impulse is present also.  He has a systolic murmur, which is heard everywhere, not otherwise easy to characterize.  It does not change with respiration.  The second component of the second sound is slightly increased in radiation consistent with a PA systolic pressure in the range of 50-60.  His legs are cool.  Venous pattern is very prominent.  His pulses are intact peripherally.  He has no abdominal bruits.  His jugular venous pressure is 14 cm.  He has no cervical adenopathy or thyromegaly.  His liver percusses at approximately 5 cm below the costal margin.  He has some increased resonance around the umbilicus.  Laterally, there is suggestion of some fluid in the distention.  There is no peripheral edema.  His joints are without obvious deformities, although he describes arthritis in his shoulder, neck, and back.  He has no skin rashes or sores, several very small ecchymoses.  His standing blood pressure is unchanged.  He has atrially triggered ventricular pacing at 98.\n\nASSESSMENT:\n1.  Etiology of left ventricular dysfunction is undetermined.  We do not know information of recent catheterization or echocardiography.  The degree of his mitral disease is not clear.  He clearly did not have coronary artery disease on one studied initially.  However, the episodicity is significant.\n2.  Current hemodynamic status shows marked volume overload and low cardiac output, and is cold and wet pattern.  His history of recent diuretic use suggests that he may have had relatively rapid onset of fluid after his last diuretic change.  However, the episode while playing pool also raises the possibility of a ventricular tachyarrhythmia undetected.  It is also possible that this is related to angina.\n3.  Other related risks.  He is on Coumadin due to his embolic shower before.  It is possible that he has had other emboli, possibly even to coronary arteries leading to recent decline in function.\n\nThere are no obvious contraindications to transplant.  At this time, we are not planning to evaluate him but to treat the urgency of his heart failure decompensation.  Our plan is to hold his beta-blockers and ACE inhibitors for now, and to begin him on an IV diuretic infusion.  We will proceed with echocardiogram and catheterization if necessary to determine whether there are other conditions exacerbating his current decompensated state.\n\n\n______________________________\nPatricia Cameron Izzo, MD\nCardiac Services\n\n\n\n\n\neScription document:2-7203595 SFFocus\n\n\n\nDD: 10/07/83\nDT: 10/07/83\nDV: 10/06/83\nRecord date: 2083-12-30\n\nLantus and Novolog Insulin Guidelines\t\n\n\n\n1.\tCheck blood sugars before meals and at bedtime.  In addition, some meals you may want to check your blood sugar (blood glucose or BG) 1 hour after taking your Novolog.  If it is over 150 you may need to take more Novolog with meals or decrease your carbohydrate intake.  You do not have to do this at every meal and you can alternate meals and/or days.  For example: Sat check before and after breakfast; Friday - lunch; Thursday - supper,etc.\n\n2.\tBe careful of the amount of carbohydrates (breads, pasta, cereal, fruit, etc) you eat at each meal and between meals.  Try to average about 60 gms. per meal and 15 gms.  for snacks.\n\n3.\tThe goal for your blood sugars when you get up in the morning and before meals  is 80-110, 1 hour after taking Novolog (at the start of the meal) it is less than 140, and at bedtime 100 to 140.\n\n4.\tYour insulin may need adjusting several times before those goals can be met. When exercising you may need more carbs or less Novolog with meals.  \n\n\n\nLong-acting insulin:  Lantus (insulin glargine)\n\n           Take _14_ units at bedtime.  \n\n           Do not mix with any other insulin.  Lantus starts to work in about 1 hr and lasts about \n\n                24 hours.  It has no peak.\n\n           If your fasting blood sugar for two or more mornings is more than 120, increase your\n\n                Lantus by 2 units at the next dose.  If it is more than 140 for two mornings then     \n\n                increase by 4 units at the next dose.  \n\n            If your fasting blood sugar is less than 70 then decrease your next dose of Lantus \n\n                 by 2 to 4 units.\n\n\n\nShort-acting insulin:  Novolog  \n\nTake 16 units of novolog with breakfast, 6 units with lunch, and 10 units with supper \n\n   (called  \"standing dose\") within 15 minutes of starting eat your meals. Do not take \n\n   standing dose if not eating.\n\nNovolog starts to work in 15 minutes and lasts about 2 hours. It peaks in about 1 hour.  \n\nYou need to eat enough carbs to cover this insulin or you will have a low blood sugar.  \n\nIf blood sugar is < 80 take    your standing dose or sliding scale.  If < 60 do not take standing \n\n     dose.\n\nTake  Novolog sliding scale (below) in addition to standing dose Novolog at mealtime \n\nIf Blood sugar is   125 - 150 take  2 units more\n\n                             150 - 200 take 3 units more \n\n                                         201 - 250 take 4 units more  \t\n\n                                         251 - 300 take 6 units more  \n\n \t\t\t     301 - 350 take 8  units more \n\n\t >351 take 10 units more and call MD if blood sugar has not \n\n          decreased or has increased after 2 hours.\n\n\n\nBedtime High Blood Sugar:  If your blood sugar at bedtime is greater than 200 take Novolog by the sliding scale below in addition to Lantus. Do not mix the two insulins.  Do not take standing dose insulin at bedtime. Have your blood sugar checked 1 to 2 hours after taking novolog at bedtime to make sure you haven't gone too low.  If you are below 80 then have a snack and juice to hold you over until morning.\n\n                                  If bedtime blood sugar is 201 - 250 take 2 units\n\n                                                                          251 - 300 take 3 units\n\n                                                                          301 - 350 take 4 units\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlease follow up with your endocrinologist or primary care practitioner in 1-2 weeks.  Bring this paper and your blood sugar results from the time you were discharged.  For urgent problems or questions about your blood sugar or insulin call 387-8267 and ask for the page operator.

He is doing quite well.  There are no exertional complaints of dyspnea or chest discomfort.  He is taking his medications without problems and denies fever, cough, rash or diarrhea.\n\nHe tells me his blood pressures at home are as high as 140-160 in the morning systolic dropping to the 130 systolic in the evenings.\n\nHis current medications are unchanged and include Neoral 125 mg b.i.d., prednisone 15 mg daily, CellCept 1 g b.i.d., aspirin 325 mg daily, Bactrim double strength one tablet every other day, calcium and vitamin D one tablet b.i.d., diltiazem CD 240 mg q.a.m. and 120 q.p.m., Lantus Insulin 20 units at bedtime, magnesium gluconate 500 mg b.i.d., multivitamin daily, Neurontin 100 mg t.i.d., NovoLog insulin p.r.n., nystatin elixir 5 mL q.i.d., omeprazole 40 mg daily, Valcyte 450 mg daily, vitamin C 500 mg b.i.d., and vitamin E 400 mg b.i.d.\n\nOn exam, he looks great.  His blood pressure is 166/98 initially, 148/82 on repeat.  His heart rate is 110.  He weighs 163 pounds.  His head and neck examination is unremarkable.  His venous pressures are less than 7 cm of water.  The lungs are clear.  The cardiac exam reveals a tachycardic rhythm with no rub, murmur or gallop.  The abdomen is unremarkable.  His numerous surgical wounds are well healed.  His extremities are warm without edema.\n\nElectrocardiography is notable for sinus tachycardia at 108 beats per minute, some nonspecific ST changes.  He underwent right heart catheterization and biopsy today.  His right atrial pressure was 5.  His wedge pressure was 17.  His PA pressures were 40/20 with a mean of 30.  The biopsy results are pending at the time of this dictation.\n\nIn summary, the patient is doing well now six weeks after cardiac transplantation.  We will be making changes to his immunosuppressive regimen as dictated by the results of his blood work and biopsy.  It is very gratifying to see how well he is doing.  We will be sure to update you on a regular basis.\n\nSincerely,\n\n\n______________________________\nGlenn V Baxter, M.D.\n\n\n\n\n\neScription document:2-6397786 SFFocus\n\nCC: Amir Naranjo M.D.\nBoys Town National Research Hospital\n3 Kelly Street\nBangkok, NJ 53591\n\n\nDD: 06/12/84\nDT: 06/12/84\nDV: 06/12/84\nRecord date: 2087-03-09\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVIGIL, ANTHONY\n40984972\n03/09/2087\n\n\n\n\nAmir Naranjo, M.D.\nSaint Josephs Hospital Of Atlanta\n4 Kelly Street\nBangkok, NJ  53591\n\n\nDear Dr. Naranjo:\n\n\nWe saw Anthony Vigil in the Internal Medicine at the Dixmont State Hospital on 03/09/2087.  He underwent orthotopic heart transplant at the Dixmont State Hospital on 03/30/2084 and returns now for his annual evaluation.  In the interval since last seen, he has done reasonably well.  His last annual evaluation at Lorain Community Hospital revealed an ejection fraction of 55% by echocardiography and no coronary disease, although left anterior descending was tortuous.  Filling pressures were normal, then with a wedge of 15 and a right atrial pressure of 9 while the pulmonary artery pressure was 30/19 with a mean of 25.  The patient does have a herniated disk at L4 and stenosis at L5.  He has lower extremity cramps, which potentially due to his spine disease have been markedly exacerbated by Pravachol.  The Pravachol was therefore stopped, restarted, and stopped again.  He continues to take insulin and his last hemoglobin A1c was 6.6.  He has had two recent episodes of mild hypoglycemia.  He has had no dermatologic evaluation.  He denies angina, congestive heart failure, or arrhythmias.\n\n\nPhysical Examination:  Reveals a weight of 183 pounds, blood pressure of 121/71, pulse of 100.  Jugular venous pressure is 8 cm of water.  Carotid upstrokes are brisk without bruits.  There are diminished breath sounds in the left lung.  Point of maximum impulse is not displaced.  First heart sound is normal, second crisp and clear.  He has an S4 at the left sternal border.  The abdomen is without hepatosplenomegaly.  There is no peripheral edema.  Peripheral pulses are diminished.\n\n\nThe electrocardiogram reveals a right bundle-branch block pattern with an intrinsic rate of 98 beats per minute.  There are nonspecific T-wave changes particularly in the early precordium.\n\n\nCurrent Medications:  Calcium with D 1250 mg twice per day, Cardura 4 mg, CellCept 1000 mg twice per day, diltiazem CD 240 mg twice per day, Ecotrin 81 mg per day, Lantus insulin 26 units at night, magnesium oxide 400 mg twice per day, vitamin, cyclosporine 100 mg twice per day, Neurontin 100 mg twice per day, NovoLog insulin as needed, prednisone 5 mg per day, vitamins C 500 mg twice per day, and vitamin E 400 units twice per day.\n\n\nImpression:  The patient will undergo his annual evaluation over the next 24 hours.  This will include blood work, chest x-ray, echocardiogram, metabolic exercise stress test, cardiac catheterization, coronary angiography, and endomyocardial biopsy.  We will see him after completion of these studies and review the results with him.  We will transmit the results to you as well at that time.\n\n\nSincerely,\n\n\n\n\n______________________________\nMichael P Rasmussen, MD\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\neScription document:0-4411667 IFFocus\n\n\nCC: Joshua Root M.D.\nBloomfield Care Center\n724 Westwood Dr\nBangkok, NJ, 53591\nFax: \nEmail: \n\n\n\n\nCC: James Ingles M.D.\nLorain Community Hospital\n88 Cote Avenue\nPhnom Penh, NJ, 71738\nFax: \nEmail: \n\n\n\n\n\n\nDD: 03/09/87\nDT: 03/09/87\nDV: 03/09/87"}

The patient was seen and examined by me, and I\n\nconfirm the resident's findings.\n\nHISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  In brief, this is a 74-year-old\n\ngentleman who presents with 2 days of chills, fevers, fatigue,\n\nand increased urinary frequency.  He has no other complaints or\n\nassociated symptoms.\n\nPlease review resident's note for full details of past medical\n\nhistory, social history, review of systems, medications, and\n\nallergies.\n\nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  I confirm the physical exam is as\n\ndocumented.  The patient is awake, alert, in mild to moderate\n\nrespiratory distress, breathing with a respiratory rate at 34,\n\noximetry noted at 88% on room air, temperature is 102 Fahrenheit,\n\npulse is 104, blood pressure is 213/89, and oximetry came up\n\nnicely to 93% on 4 liters and 100% on nonrebreather facemask. \n\nNeck is supple.  Mucous membranes are dry.  Lungs reveal slightly\n\ndecreased breath sounds at the bases; however, there are few\n\ncrackles noted in the left lower base.  Heart is tachycardic but\n\nregular.  The remainder of the exam is unremarkable.\n\nLABORATORY DATA:  White count is noted at 11.6 and hematocrit\n\n28.2.  This is close to the patient's baseline.  BUN and\n\ncreatinine 69 and 5.8, 5.8 is quite elevated for this patient. \n\nHowever, he has been evaluated for recent diagnosis of renal\n\nfailure by the Nephrology Service.  Bicarbonate is 21 and\n\npotassium is 4.3.  Urinalysis reveals some blood and protein,\n\notherwise not suggestive of an infection.  EKG is tachycardic\n\nwith left ventricular hypertrophy in a strain pattern.  Chest\n\nx-ray shows diffuse fluffy infiltrates bilaterally with bilateral\n\npleural effusions, few Kerley B lines, and fluid in the lungs\n\nfissures.\n\nEMERGENCY DEPARTMENT COURSE:  The patient was covered with\n\nceftriaxone and azithromycin for his presumed pneumonia.  He also\n\nreceived nitro paste for preload reduction as well as a Foley\n\ncatheter and Lasix, all for his CHF.\n\nDISPOSITION:  The patient was admitted to the hospital.\n\n ******** Not reviewed by Attending Physician ********\n\nDIAGNOSES:  Pneumonia, CHF, and renal failure.\n\n______________________________\n\nSORENSEN, SAUL \n\nD: 08/13/79\n\nT: 08/13/79\n\nDictated By: SORENSEN, SAUL\n\neScription document:4-5119504 BFFocus\nRecord date: 2080-11-09\n\nMANAMANA INPATIENT RENAL TRANSPLANT ADMIT NOTE\n\n\n\nReferring Physician: Dr. Amar Jacoby\n\n\n\nOutpatient Nephrologist: Dr. Pao Arias\n\n\n\nReason for Admission: Living unrelated renal transplant\n\nCMV status: Donor negative, Recipient Negative\n\nHLA: share one HLA-B and HLA-DR locus antigen, negative cross-match\n\nInduction: Simulect, Prograf, MMF, steroid taper\n\n\n\nHPI: 76-year-old man with history of per-ESRD 2/2 DM, HTN underwent pre-emptive living unrelated (stepson) renal transplant on 11/08/80.

Again\n     noted is a transcervical fracture to the right femur.  There is\n     superior lateral displacement of the distal fracture segment.  The\n     sacrum is not well seen secondary to overlying bowel gas.  Minimal\n     degenerative changes of the lumbar spine are noted.\n     \n     Shoulder: There is no evidence of left shoulder dislocation or\n     acute fracture.  The visualized lung fields and ribs are intact.\n     There is minimal degenerative change involving the left a.c.\n     joint.\n     \n     Chest: Comparison to 10/31/97.  Multiple pulmonary nodules are\n     noted.  There is no evidence of focal consolidation or pulmonary\n     edema.  No large pleural effusion or appreciable pneumothorax is\n     identified.  The cardiomediastinal silhouette is stable.\n     Degenerative changes of the thoracic spine are noted.\n     \n     IMPRESSION:\n     Right transcervical femoral fracture.  No evidence of dislocation.\n     \n     No evidence of shoulder dislocation.\n     \n     Multiple pulmonary nodules consistent with metastatic disease.\n     \n     FINDINGS:\n     Previously noted minimally displaced right hip fracture.\n     Osteoarthrosis of the knee. Soft tissues swelling along the medial\n     aspect of the knee is noted.  There are vascular calcifications.\n     Generalized osteopenia.\n     \n     IMPRESSION:\n     Right hip fracture as previously described.

The plan of care by issue is as follows:\n\n\n(1)     Right hip fracture: Patient will require post-operative anti-coagulation. Patient is undergoing high-risk procedure and is also at increased risk for VTE given cancer dx. According to guidelines from ACCP:\n\n\n#UFH 5000 Units SC TID [or LMWH &gt;3400 Units SC QD (her CrCl &lt;30, therefore renally dosed = LMWH 30mg SC QD)] to be started either in PACU or on the floor.\n#Compression stockings\n#Pneumo-boots\n#Plan to continue VTE prophylaxis for 4-6 weeks post-op\n#Encourage ambulation as soon as tolerated (per ortho, pt might be ambulatory as soon as tomorrow)\n\n\n(2)     DM\nPatient recently started on insulin at home. Will continue half dose of home insulin with IVF with glucose.\n#RISS, until tolerating POs, then restart normal insulin.\n\n\n(3)     Dispo\nPlan to D/C when clinically stable post-op. Per PCP, patient would like to return directly home after surgery without rehab (home rehab). Family notes that patient currently lives at daughter&#8217;s home where there are many steps which would make home rehab difficult.\n\n\n#Consider rehab placement, follow-up attending recs, discuss with family in AM\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n_______________________________________\nBrandon Hale\nEFS III, Internal Medicine\nPager #28913\n\n\nADDENDUM:\nCase and plan discussed and incorporated into this excellent EFSIII Note.\n\n\n\n\n_______________________________\nFred Allen, M.D.\nMedicine PGY1\nPager #80817"}

Linear filling defect in      the apical segmental artery of the left upper lobe could represent      chronic embolus.     2.Suboptimal opacification of the femoral veins.  Evaluation of DVT      is suboptimal.  Ultrasound of the lower extremities for deep      indicated to rule out DVT clinically indicated.     3.Evaluation of pulmonary parenchyma somewhat limited respiratory      motion.  There is bilateral subsegmental atelectasis.  The patient      has undergone prior lower lobe wedge resection.\n  4. There are multiple mediastinal and hilar      lymph nodes, which are some centimeters in size.  They are slightly      more prominent than in the previous exam.  The right hilar lymph node      now measures 0.9 cm in short axis. The visualized thyroid gland      appears normal.  There are atherosclerotic vascular calcifications of      the coronary arteries.\n\n5.      Legs: There is suboptimal opacification of the femoral veins limiting evaluation for deep venous thrombosis.  Doppler ultrasound would be      indicated to look for DVT. Significant bilateral degenerative changes      of the hips are seen.\n\n****************************************************\n\n\nAssessment:\n\n 64F with h/o NSCLC, COPD, CHF who presents with 36 hours of increasing SOB and a feeling that \"the fluid is coming back.\"  Has been on increasing doses on furosemide this week which has improved edema per patient but breathing is still worse today.  No other major symptoms.  \n\n\n\nPlan:\n\n\n\n\n\n#\n SOB\nPatient presents with increasing SOB in the context of increasing ankle size and sense that she is hypervolemic.  Increased lasix has improved her fluid status but did not fully resolve her respiratory issue, which is worse today than yesterday. Differential includes CHF with fluid overload, PE, malignancy with obstructive component, PNA, or COPD exacerbation with viral infection. Increasing pulmonary hypertension a concern (h/o hypoventilation syndrome, RVH on echo, worsening dyspnea).\n-Large acute PE ruled out with CT\n-? of whether mediastinal and hilar lymph nodes have increased in size since previous, no other obvious progression of NSCLC, CT findings would not account for her dyspnea\n-CXR and CT negative for acute PNA\n-CXR and CT show mild atalectasis, possible interstitial fluid, but show no effusions or other significant signs of fluid overload.  BNP is not very high.  However, patient has poor PFTs and small change in volume status may tip her into respiratory distress.  Cough c/w increased volume or viral infection\n-Plan is to continue with diuresis as volume overload is most likely explanation of her respiratory status, furosemide 80 mg BID with PRN lasix as needed to maintain fluid status -500-1.0 L tomorrow.  Avoiding more aggressive diuresis as she has a history of over-diuesis with ARF.\n\n\n-Continue home Tiotropium, Albuterol, Fluticasone Prop/Salmeterol 500/50 (Advair Diskus 500/50) \n\n\n#\n NSCLC\nLikely not the cause of tonight's presentation with acute SOB, although chest CT must be re-evaluated for possible evidence of cancer.  Mild or no increased size of mediastinal lymph nodes may be concerning.  \n-F/U with Dr. Lacey in AM, patient wants all information regarding imaging results and prognosis directly from Dr. Lacey\n-Appt already scheduled for July 13th with Dr. Lacey for f/u\n\n\n#Anxiety/Depression\nPatient prescribed clonazepam 0.25 BID but is taking it 0.25 in AM, 0.25 in PM, and additional 0.5 QHS for significant anxiety.

According to the patient, she left the hospital, completed the course of Tamiflu and azithromycin on 2/24, and continued to feel poorly, with a chronic nagging cough that was productive of dark green sputum. \nNo fever, chills, sweats, myalgias, or SOB.  Yesterday, she developed worsening pain, especially in her ribs, extending across the anterior surface; she said the pain is worse with movement but does not vary with respiration or cough.

He has had a series of illness over the spring, beginning with a hospitalization for pneumonia in June. He later developed what was thought to be a splenic subcapsular hematoma (on Coumadin for chronic atrial fibrillation) and then subsequently developed LUQ pain and was found to have a splenic abscess that was drained. In the course of this illness, he also developed an ischemic R foot and was found (at what stage?) to have a popliteal aneurysm. \n\n\n\nAt the time of his admission, he was found to have diabetes. He has been treated with Lantus insulin, most recently 15 Units at bedtime, on which regimen he has had consistent overnight drops, often to hypoglycemic levels.

Colon, M.D.\nMcCaw Family Medicine\n84 Grace Drive, Suite 046\nDelano, TX 28221\n\n\nRE:                  Oliver Jain\nLEPROSARIUM:              962-85-18\n\n\nDear Dr. Colon:\n\n\nI am writing to inform you that I am seeing Mr. Oliver Jain in followup.  Mr. Jain was admitted to my service in transfer for right lower extremity ischemia and gangrene following atheroembolization from a popliteal aneurysm, as you know.  He was admitted in early September and stayed until early October.  During his hospital stay here his wounds were addressed.  He underwent angiograms to evaluate his arterial anatomy and he underwent reconstruction of the right wherein covered stent graft was used to cover disease in his proximal femoral artery and then he underwent an above knee to below knee popliteal artery bypass using PTFE with ligation of the aneurysm.  He also subsequently underwent angioplasty of his posterior tibial artery.  Given his atheroembolic phenomenon he had very limited vasculature remaining in the foot and I was concerned that the forefoot gangrene would progress and he would wind up losing the right foot.  In the interim since his discharge he appears to be doing quite well.  The gangrene of the right foot has remained stable with clearcut demarcation of the right first, second and third toes.  He also has some heel ulceration that I am hoping to nurse through.  He denies any rest pain or pain in the foot.  He has no evidence of fevers, chills, rigors or shakes in the interim.  He has since been discharged to home and has been walking with a walking shoe.  His left lower extremity aneurysm is yet to be treated and he has not developed any symptoms with regards to the left lower extremity.  He has been taking his Coumadin regularly and has had therapeutic INRs as he reports.  \n\n\nOn exam today he is doing quite well.  He is in good spirits and appears much better than in the hospital.  His head and neck exams were unremarkable.  His lungs were clear.  Heart was regular.  His proximal groin and leg incisions have healed up nicely, however there is some dry eschar on the midportion of the wound.  With regards to the toes he has clearcut demarcation and heel ulceration.  There is no evidence of cellulitis, induration or infection of the right lower extremity.  He continues to have a stable looking foot on the left.  Given his extensive peripheral vascular disease I performed PVRs in the office today, which revealed that he has pulsatile PVRs at the right calf and ankle.  He also has slight pulsatile PVRs at the right transmetatarsal level.  This bodes well with regards to his revascularization as well as his potential to either heal or remain stable with regards to the necrosis on the right foot.  His left calf, ankle and transmetatarsal PVRs were similar.  \n\n\nIn summary, this is an unfortunate gentleman who developed atheroembolic phenomena resulting in digital ischemia as well as heel ischemia with the potential for limb loss in the near future of the right lower extremity.  He does have an untreated aneurysm on the left with potential for atheroembolization of the left lower extremity.  Given this concern, I will proceed next with a left lower extremity revascularization to exclude the popliteal aneurysm so that he does not develop limb-threatening gangrene of the left.  With regards to the right I will try to initiate some hyperbaric oxygen therapy and will probably re-evaluate his distal circulation with an angiogram at the time of his next admission or some time thereafter.  I am hoping to facilitate healing of the heel wound with the final outcome of a transmetatarsal amputation of the right lower extremity but will see how it goes.  My thanks again for this referral.  I apologize for not sending you correspondence earlier.  With this correspondence I will send you his operative diagram as well as his most recent discharge summary.\n\n\nSincerely,\n\n\n\n\nQuincy T.

She subsequently underwent a mediastinoscopy in April of this year for bulky adenopathy which the pathology was also consistent with sarcoidosis.  She present for evaluation of abdominal pain that has been present for months but became unbearable prompting a visit to the emergency room.  Mrs. Haynes reports that over the past few months she has been experiencing weight loss, early satiety, night sweats and fatigue.  He abdominal pain is described as a sharp to achy pain that started in her right side, progressed to her epigastric and suprapubic are and then her left side.  Currently it is diffuse associated with nausea and vomiting.  She denies bowel problems has had some difficulty with urination and some frequency since admission but this is generally not a problem.  ROS is also pertinet for HA which are chronic and palpations both of which are hard to describe.\n \nROS: In detail otherwise unremarkable.\n\n\nPast Medical History:  \n\nHTN, Hyperlipidemia (h/o normal stress test in past), palpitations, GERD, thyroid nodules, lichen sclerosis, bilateral adrenal adenomas, diabetes mellitus type II, sarcoidosis\n\n\nPast Surgical History:  \n s/p uterine fibroid resection 2096, s/p left facial biopsy 10/01\n\n\n\n\n \n\nMedications (current):  \n \n\nCiprofloxacin 500 mg q 12 hr\nLovenox 40 mg SC day\nLisinopril 40 mg Po day\nSimvastatin 40 mg QHS\nNifedipine 60 mg Po day\nOmeprazole 40 mg Po day\nNPH/Insulin Aspart\nMag Sulfate\nCA Carbonate\nColace\n\n\n\n\nAllergies:              sulfa causes GI intolerance\n\n\n\n\nFamily History:   Sister x 2 w/MI, Sister w/DM type II, Niece w/DM type II, Brother w/prostate CA, Brother w/possible leukemia, Mother w CVA. No Hx of sarcoid or TB in the family.\n\n\n\n\nSocial History:  The patient is a lifelong nonsmoker with a 20 year exposure to secondhand smoke.  The patient has no known asbestos exposure.  The patient is widowed with four children and is retired from her former job at Lowe's.  She was born in Georgia moved to Chelsea in the 50's and the only place she has visited was Augusta.  No TB exposures or risk factors.  States she had been tested for TB in the past years ago.

Cx data was not obtained.  However, hx is not suggestive of past tuberculosis risk factors.  Clinical picture very suggestive of systemic sarcoidosis.  At this time she does not have an absolute indication for sarcoid treatment but she may benefit symptomatically from low dose steroids.  At this time she is reluctant to start steroids without discussing it with her family and Dr. Villalpando.\n\n\nRecommendations:  \n \n-Would consider Cardiac MRI given her hx of palpitations as cardiac sarcoid is an absolute indication for treatment.\n-Would recommend checking PPD\n-Would recommend starting prednisone 30mg po qday.  Will discuss this further with patient and family tomorrow.  There is no rush for treatment at this time and we could waite until Dr. Villalpando is available to speak with Mrs. Haynes.\n-Would also recommend Bactrim prophylaxis while she is on greater than 15 mg Po prednisone.  1 DS M/W/F.\n-Will follow.\n\n\n\n\nThank you for this interesting consult.

She comes with her daughter who assists with the history.  I will review her history for the record.\n\n\nShe is a 69-year-old right-handed woman who was hospitalized at the Promptcare in July 2103 for evaluation of mental and motor slowing, memory loss, and weight loss.  Her daughter notes that she had deteriorated over the course of a month or two.  Her movements slowed down, and she became unsteady on her feet, and her memory deteriorated.  This culminated in a fall in July prompting her hospitalization.  During that hospitalization a head CT on 7/25/03 was reported unremarkable.  (There is mild ventriculomegaly on it.)  An MRI of the brain on 7/28 showed a few dots of restricted diffusion in the left thalamus. There was no abnormal enhancement.  This was consistent with small vessel stroke.  EEG showed generalized slowing of the background in the theta and delta range with no epileptiform features.  An LP showed normal glucose (74), elevated protein (102), lymphocytic pleocytosis (18-20 WBC, 56-69% lymphocytes, 29-40% monocytes, and 2-4% neutrophils) and 0-1 RBC.  CSF ACE was normal.  Cultures were negative.  CSF VDRL was negative.  Because she has a history of sarcoidosis, it was thought that this likely represented neurosarcoidosis.  She was started on prednisone 40 mg daily.  Her daughter has noted some improvement in her movements and cognition since starting the prednisone, but she remains abnormal.  She has lowered the prednisone to 10 mg daily now.  Reviewing the laboratory studies today, I see that although an RPR was non-reactive, a TA-IgG was positive, and the confirming treponemal tests (FTA) was also positive at the state lab.  She and her daughter are aware of no prior history of syphilis.  Other studies during her hospitalization included low serum Na (133) and Mg (1.3), normal vitamin B12, folate, TSH, and ESR (20).  CSF HSV PCR was negative.  HbA1C was elevated at 8.6.  \n\n\nShe has a history of asthma going back many years.  According to her daughter, she had a skin lesion excised from near her left eye about two years ago.  Apparently, this showed noncaseated granuloma, and that is when the diagnosis of sarcoidosis was first made.  She then had a mediatinoscopy on 4/10/02.  Biopsy of mediastinal nodes showed granulomatous inflammation without caseating necrosis, supporting the diagnosis of sarcoidosis.  She has type II DM, HTN, hypercholesterolemia, GERD, and she has had a thyroid adenoma.  \n\n\nHer current medications are prednisone 10 mg daily, aspirin 81 mg daily, troglitazone, metformin, glyburide, sisinoril, pravastatin, vitamin D, calcium CO3, Colace, and an inhaler for her asthma as needed.  She is allergic to sulfa agents and to fluticasone nasal spray.  There is no history of allergy to PCN.  \n\n\nHer parents both died of some type of cancer.  There is no family history of sarcoidosis or of neurologic disease.\n\n\nShe is a widow.  She has four children.  She used to work for Lowe's.  She now lives with a daughter. \n\n\nShe has had no recent fever or chills.  Her weight has been stable and her appetite good.  There is no history of exertional chest pain or palpitations.  There is no history of cough, dyspnea, nausea, vomiting, or diarrhea.  She has had no rash or joint symptoms.\n\n\nPulse 126, regular.  BP 126/66.  She is obese.  Ears, nose, and throat are clear.  There are no cranial bruits.  The neck is supple with full carotid pulses and no bruits.  There are wheezes bilaterally.  The heart is regular with no murmur.  The abdomen is benign.  The extremities are normal.\n\n\nThere is general psychomotor slowing.  She is oriented to time, expect that she gets the date off by two days as Aug 31.  She is oriented to place.  She is inattentive.  She is able to recite the months in order, but she gets lost trying to recite them in reverse.  She has trouble registering 4 words, and she recalls only 2 of 4 after three minutes.  There is no aphasia.  She cannot copy interlocking pentagons and her copy of a 3D cube shows poor spacial representation.  \n\n\nThe visual fields are full.  The pupils are 3 mm and normally reactive.  The fundi are poorly visualized.  .  The eye movements are full and conjugate with no nystagmus; pursuit movement are saccadic.  Facial sensation is intact.  Facial power is normal and symmetric.  Hearing is grossly intact.  Weber and Rinne tests are normal.  The palate elevates normal.  Gag is present.  The sternocleidomastoid and trapezius power are normal.  The tongue protrudes in the midline.  Muscle bulk, tone, and power are normal.  There is a low-amplitude, high-frequency tremor in action and rest.  Temperature and pinprick sensation are diminished in the lower extremities with a distally-predominant gradient.  Reflexes are normal (2/4) and symmetric in the upper extremities and at the knees and absent at the ankles.  Plantar responses are flexor.  Coordination is intact.  Romberg is negative.  Gait and station are normal.\n\n\nHer treponemal test for syphilis came back positive from the hospitalization in July.  Since syphilis, too, could cause noncaseating granulomas, and she has clearly has syphilis at some point in the past which was probably untreated, this raises some doubt about the diagnosis of sarcoidosis.  I will review that issue with you and with Dr, Villalpando.  She had CSF pleocytosis in July.  With that and the positive treponemal test (FTA), she will need a full course of intravenous penicillin for presumed neurosyphilis.  I will discuss arrangements for possible outpatient management of hatt with a PICC line and outpatient VNA services.  Concerning her need for prednisone, I think that will depend on our interpretation of the diagnosis of sarcoidosis in light of this new diagnosis.  If the evidence of sarcoidosis is not strong with this alternative diagnosis, then we can plan to complete the course of penicillin and taper and discontinue the prednisone and then follow her clinical course, her CSF, and her syphilis serologies.\n\n\nFinally, from the MRI of 7/28, shows a couple of tiny foci of restricted diffusion in the left thalamus.  These are most consistent with small vessel ischemic strokes.  She has multiple risk factors for common small vessel disease and stroke, but in the context of her inflammatory CSF and evidence of prior syphilis, we must also consider cerebrovascular syphilis as the likely cause of this.\n\n\nI would recommend treatment now with a 14-day course of high-dose (20-24 million units a day) penicillin.  She is already on prednisone which might help to prevent any possible Jarisch-Herxheimer reaction.  I think that if she remains stable after the initiation of her PCN therapy, then we can plan to taper and then discontinue the prednisone, to follow her clinically and with repeated LP, and determine any need for future corticosteroid therapy on her course.  \n\n\nThank you for this consultation.\n\n\n\n\nSincerely,\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKeondre Viera, M.D.\nRecord date: 2104-01-30\n\n\nNEUROLOGY RESIDENT CONSULT NOTE \n\n\n\n\n\nPATIENT NAME: Dalila Haynes\nMRN: 78361343\nDATE OF CONSULT: 1/30/04\n\n\n\n \nConsulted by: ED for altered mental status and generalized weakness\n\n\n\nHPI:   \n\n69 yo F h/o systemic sarcoidosis (extensive adenopathy in the chest, abdomen, and adrenal glands, and has been on corticosteroids), CNS syphillis s/p treatment  who presents with several weeks increasing generalized weakness and several days of increasing confusion. Patient is unable to give a reliable history; history from daughter Inez Haynes, whom I called on the phone, and from LMR (primarily Dr. Keondre Viera's August neurology note). Her daughter reports that current decline is similar to her presentation in July 2103.\n\n\nShe was hospitalized at Promptcare in July 2103 for evaluation of mental and motor slowing, memory loss, and weight loss that had progressed over 1 to 2 months. Head CT on 7/25/03 with only mild ventriculomegaly. An MRI of the brain on 7/28 showed a few dots of restricted diffusion in the left thalamus. There was no abnormal enhancement. This was consistent with small vessel stroke. EEG showed generalized slowing of the background in the theta and delta range with no epileptiform features. She had normal vitamin B12, folate, TSH, and ESR (20). CSF HSV PCR was negative. HbA1C was elevated at 8.6. An LP showed normal glucose (74), elevated protein (102), lymphocytic pleocytosis (18-20 WBC, 56-69% lymphocytes, 29-40% monocytes, and 2-4% neutrophils) and 0-1 RBC. CSF ACE was normal. Cultures were negative. CSF VDRL was negative. She was initially treated with prednisone 40 mg daily tapered down to 10 mg daily. In follow up, it was noted that RPR was non-reactive, a TA-IgG was positive, and the confirming treponemal tests (FTA) was also positive at the state lab. This was thought to represent neurosyphillis and she was admitted and treated w/ 14 days of IV penicillin. Prednisone was subsequently tapered to off since her presentation was thought to be consistent w/ neurosyphillis and not neurosarcoidosis.\n\n\n\nPer her daughter, patient had improved back to being independent of ADL's and walking with a cane witout assistance. Over the last few weeks, she has gotten progressively more weak with multiple falls. Has trouble standing now, seems unsteady on her feet, has been primarily in bed for the last few days, requiring assistance to get to the bathroom or she falls down. Over the last several days, she has become even more globally weak and confused. She has been talking about relatives who are not in the house, thinking that they are there; thinking that the closet is the bathroom. It was a slow progression over a few weeks and then accelerated over the last few days. Patient reports intermittent headaches.\n\n\nOn presentation to the ED, she was noted to be tachycardic in the 120's (baseline resting tachycardia documented for many months, being worked up by cards), normotensive, afebrile, oriented x 2, and moving all extremities. \n\n\n \nROS: \nReliability of ROS is questionable.\nNeurologic: Except as above, there have been no changes in vision or hearing, neck pain, tinnitus, vertigo, numbness, speaking, language, swallowing, or gait.\n\n\n\nGeneral: negative for fevers, chills, rashes, change in weight, chest pain, palpitations, shortness of breath, cough, abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and change in bowel or bladder habits.\n\n\n\nPMH:   \n1.

Exam notable for poor memory and some confusion about recent events.  Labs are unremarkable except minor electrolyte abnormalities. Head CT unremarkable. Her prior presentation was thought to be most likely due to neurosyphillis as detailed above, though there was still the possibility of neurosarcoid. She has not had a repeat LP to assess for resolution of prior abnormalities, and now that she has a recurrence of symptoms, she should have repeat LP. She should also have an MRI as a thalamic or frontal stroke is another possible etiology. This could be a more global failure to thrive in the setting of deconditioning followed by poor PO's, but this should be a diagnosis of exclusion. CXR raises a question of retrocardiac opacity suggesting possible PNA, but with normal WBC, no URI sx's or cough, and no fever, I think it is unlikely that she has PNA and will follow clinically.\n\n\n-check her gait\n-check ESR\n\n\n\n-LP for standard studies and save 5-10 cc for additional studies depending on cell count/TP\n-MRI of the brain\n-EEG\n-further lab w/u pending LP results\n-remove foley catheter\n-PT consult\n\n\n\n\n___________________________________ \nBobby S.

She is here with her daughter.  She notes that she is mostly feeling tired lately.  She is able to walk with help and is even unable to walk upstairs with assistance.  She is here in a wheelchair and says she is kind of tired and lets her daughter gives most of the history even when asked simple questions.  She has been checking her blood sugars and she shows me the results.  In the morning, the sugars have been fairly low in the 57-100 range, around noontime high at 144 up to 398, and in the evening high again 176-245.  She is taking Lantus 38 units at 9:00 p.m. and she is on NovoLog coverage less than 25-0 units, 125-152 units, 151-204 units, 201-256 units, 251-308 units and greater than 310 units.  She would like to switch over her Lantus to the Pens since the pen is so much easier for her.  She complains of hemorrhoids, although she says they are actually getting better, she had previously had four now she has two.  There is no bleeding.  There is no pain, kind of itchy and uncomfortable.  She is in fact not having any problem with constipation at this time.  She is having bowel movements every day.  She is not having any chest pain, no trouble breathing, no fevers, sweats or chills.  No abdominal symptoms.  She notes her stomach is really fine and it just not causing any trouble at all.\n\n\n\nMEDICATIONS:  Aspirin, lisinopril 40 daily, Lantus 38, NovoLog coverage, omeprazole 40 daily, metoprolol, potassium chloride, Lasix 40 daily, Pravachol 40 nightly, and Symbicort.\n\n\n\nALLERGIES:  Bactrim GI intolerance, fluticasone, cough and sucralfate unknown.\n\n\n\nSOCIAL HISTORY:  She has never smoked, no alcohol, no street drugs.\n\n\n\nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Well developed, well nourished, no acute distress.  Blood pressure 121/65, pulse 106, weight 169.8, and temperature 98.6.  A delightful woman, English speaking and sitting in a wheelchair.  Quite alert, did know the president, could not recall the vice-president or against whom the president ran in the last election.  She did know the day of the week and she knew where she was.  She also remembered to remind me about a prescription when both her daughter and I almost forgot.  She is an absolutely delightful woman, appears well and alert despite the fact that she lets her daughter provides most of the history and responses.  She appears comfortable, breathing easily, no use of accessory muscles of inspiration, speaking in full sentences, no cough, no spine or flank tenderness.  Heart sounds S1, S2, regular rate and rhythm, no murmur, rub or gallop.  Chest is clear to auscultation anteriorly and posteriorly with no rales, wheezes, or rhonchi.  She is clear to percussion.  Extremities:  Without edema, cyanosis or clubbing, no calf tenderness.\n\n\n\nIMPRESSION AND PLAN:\n\n1.  Diabetes.  Her A1c today was 6.6, which represents excellent control despite a fairly high glucoses she was recording.  I therefore did not want to increase her regimen despite the high glucoses.  We will continue for now.  I did give her an appointment with the diabetes nurse for help in management of her diabetes.\n\n2.  Hypertension.  Her blood pressure is fine.  We will continue current regimen.  We will check electrolytes.\n\n3.  Tachycardia actually improved relative to her last visit.  She is asymptomatic in this regard except for some fatigue.\n\n4.  Fatigue.  This is most likely due to stepping down from the prednisone 60-40.  This is what the patient and her daughter believe.  She was somewhat fatigued before, but they note that it is worse with this.  She does need to come off the prednisone and Dr. Villalpando who she just saw is going to try to come up with another plan for her. Check cbc.\n\n5.  Acid associated symptoms well controlled with omeprazole.\n\n6.  Right knee mild osteoarthritis, not a problem today.\n\n7.  CNS syphilis status post treatment.\n\n8.  Question of CNS sarcoid currently on 40 mg of prednisone and hopefully she will be able to come off of that and perhaps get started on something else.\n\n9.  Cholesterol.  We will recheck her cholesterol today and will check an SGPT.\n\n10.  Thyroid nodules.  Ultrasound in July 2103 showed stability.\n\n11.  Adrenal adenoma.  Her CAT scan in May 2102 showed stability and some adenopathy consistent with sarcoid.\n\n12.  Lichen simplex chronicus.  Dermatology diagnosis from 2101.  Not addressed today.  Hopefully, she will be stronger at her next visit and we can recheck.\n\n13.  Osteopenia.  She will continue calcium and vitamin D.  I encouraged weightbearing exercise as tolerated.\n\n14.  Glaucoma suspect, not addressed today.\n\n15.  Small vessel ischemic disease.  MRI from July showed changes consistent with small vessel ischemic stroke.  She is currently on aspirin and stable.\n\n16. Hemorrhoids - anusolHC given. Given no bleeding and no pian, this hopefully will fuffice. Recommended avoiding constipation, as she is doing, with lots of dietary fruits and vegetables.\n\n\n\nHgA1C 6.6\nCBC slightly elevated WBC likely due to prednisone\nSGPT, lytes o.k.\nCHOL LDL 1124 elevated but HDL also high, protective, cntu pravachol and rercheck\nletter sent\n\n______________________________\n\nOdessia Q Kay, M.D.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\neScription document:3-89996385 JSSten Tel\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDD: 04/15/04\n\nDT: 04/15/04\n\nDV: 04/14/04"}

She also has a history of interstitial lung disease, maintained on prednisone slow taper.  She also has hypertension and hyperlipidemia.  She had been residing at a nursing home and complained of chest pain, jaw pain and bilateral shoulder pain for approximately 1 week.  Eventually, the patient was transferred to Wheeling Clinic.  Here in the Emergency Department, the patient was found to be hypotensive with a systolic blood pressure in the 70s, which improved to the 90s with volume and blood resuscitation.  She also found to be tachycardic and have a hematocrit of 25%.  The patient was also found to be guaiac positive on stool occult blood.  Her troponin was mildly elevated.  The patient was transfused with several units of packed red blood cells and her chest discomfort has improved.  She also underwent echocardiography on 03/26/80, which was a fair quality study with a mildly dilated left ventricle, mild LVH, septal flattening consistent with RV pressure overload and an estimated ejection fraction of 35% to 40%.  Diastolic dysfunction was also noted.  There was dilatation of both atria and the right ventricle with mildly reduced RV systolic function.  The aortic valve could not be well visualized.  There was reduced cusp excursion with severe aortic stenosis.  There was mild tricuspid regurgitation and estimated PASP of 60 to 65 mmHg plus RA pressure.  There was mild-to-moderate mitral regurgitation with a posteriorly directed jet.  The aortic valve peak gradient was 115.6 mmHg and mean gradient was 77.05 mmHg.  Valve area was not calculated.\n\n\nThe patient was transferred to Madison Medical Center for treatment of her symptoms.  She notes that her chest pain has improved.  She notes that she had worsening of her baseline dyspnea on exertion and shortness of breath at rest starting in September that has been gradually progressing.  She denies trouble breathing at night.  She also notes peripheral edema that seems worse now than it did back in September.  She denies any fevers, chills or cough.\n\n\nPAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Significant for porcine aortic valve replacement in 2078, BOOP, hypertension, hyperlipidemia and congestive heart failure.\n\n\nMEDICATIONS:  Her discharge medications from Wheeling Clinic were prednisone 25 mg p.o. once daily, Humalog insulin sliding scale, metoprolol 6.25 mg p.o. b.i.d., lisinopril 10 mg p.o. once daily, Lasix 40 mg p.o. once daily, metolazone 5 mg p.o. once daily, simvastatin 20 mg p.o. once daily, omeprazole 20 mg p.o. once daily, Ativan 0.5 mg p.o. q.8 h. p.r.n., aspirin 81 mg p.o. once daily, vitamin D 400 units once daily, oxybutynin 5 mg p.o. once daily, Milk of magnesium p.r.n. and MiraLax p.r.n.\n\n\nALLERGIES:  Penicillin and sulfa.\n\n\nSOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient lives in a nursing home.  She typically ambulates with a walker, though she has become dyspneic even ambulating a few feet.  She quit smoking 40 years ago.  There is no alcohol use.  She has 6 children, all in good health, one of whom is accompanying her and is studying to be a lawyer.\n\n\nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  The patient appears comfortable and is sitting upright in a chair.  Her heart rate is 82 to 96 and regular, blood pressure 150/98, repeat is 126/86, repeat is 110/72, respiratory rate is 20, oxygen saturation 98% on 2 L nasal cannula and temperature 97.6.  JVP is difficult to assess given body habitus.  Lungs exhibit bibasilar crackles one-third of the way up, worse on the left than the right.  Air movement is fair.  There are no carotid bruits.  Carotid upstrokes are markedly diminished and mildly delayed.  On heart exam, PMI could not be felt.  There is a regular rate and rhythm with a 3/6 crescendo-decrescendo early to mid systolic peaking murmur heard best at the right upper sternal border radiating across the precordium.  There are no rubs or gallops.  Extremities show no clubbing, cyanosis or edema.  There is moderate pedal edema bilaterally going up to the ankles.\n\n\nEKG shows sinus rhythm at a rate of 87 beats per minute, left atrial enlargement, LVH by voltage with secondary ST and T-wave changes, but what appeared to be primary T-wave inversions in leads V3 to V6 consistent with ischemia and these changes are more dramatic than they were back on 03/03/78 EKG.\n\n\nLab testing reveals normal sodium, potassium, chloride, carbon dioxide, BUN, creatinine and glucose.  Magnesium and calcium were normal.  Albumin is low at 2.6.  Liver function tests are normal.  Creatinine kinase is 15, troponin is 0.7 and B-natriuretic peptide is 2510.  Thyroid studies are pending.  Hemoglobin A1c is 5.7.  CBC shows mild anemia with hematocrit of 35.8% with normal hemoglobin of 12.2, elevated white count at 13.32 and platelet count of 305,000.  Coagulation studies are normal.\n\n\nIMPRESSION:  A 72-year-old woman with congestive heart failure, recent echocardiogram suggesting severe aortic stenosis and her bioprosthetic aortic valve replacement for AS back in 2080 and GI bleed with significant anemia, now transfused and improved.  The patient also has chronic interstitial lung disease for which she is on chronic steroid therapy.\n\n\nI think the main issue is to determine whether there is significant aortic stenosis that may require re-intervention.  On exam, most features are not consistent with severe aortic stenosis, so we will repeat the echocardiogram here and determine if there is severe aortic stenosis in the bioprosthetic valve, and if so, what is the pathology.  Depending on this, we will determine whether the patient needs surgical reoperation.  If so, she will need to have her GI tract looked that first for the source of GI bleeding in order to treat this in preparation for repeat cardiac surgery.\n\n\nIn addition, the patient will be treated for congestive heart failure with increased diuretics, following her inputs and outputs, daily weights, basal metabolic panel, exam and chest x-ray.  Her beta-blocker will be increased due to her recent myocardial event, keeping an eye on her CHF in order to not worsen it.  Beta-blocker will be gradually increased given the lung disease and congestive heart failure. Endocarditis will be ruled out with serial blood cultures.\n\n\n\n\n______________________________\nRay Downing, MD\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\neScription document:1-2235241 CSSten Tel\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDD: 03/28/80\nDT: 03/28/80\nDV: 03/28/80\nRecord date: 2080-04-17\n\n\n\nDiabetes Management Consult \n\n\n\n\n\n\nCC    \n\nAsked by Dr Vines to see the patient for assistance with management of diabetes mellitus.\n She is intubated so details of medical history not available other than what I can get from medical records and her daughters who are with her.\n\n\n\nHPI   \n\n72year old female patient with a history of diabetes diagnosed &gt;20 years ago.

She states increasing SOB since 9/79 and now has difficulty with any activity. She had chest pain this previous week at her rehabilitation facility/nursing home and was evaluated at OSH. She was found to have anemia with hct 25 and increased troponin to 1.5. Pt was found to be CHF and is being treated with IV lasix. Was diagnosed with SBE with BC positive for enterococci and gemella morbillorum. Was initially on Vancomycin then later switched to Ampicillin and gentamycin for 6 weeks course(till May 11) as per ID recs. GI was consulted for guaiac positive stool and Hct drop. But over the course of hospital stay her Hct was stable and stool guaiac negative so GI deferred scoping her till her is clear of infection.

Betty Gillis is a very pleasant 73-year-old woman who was recently admitted to the Griffin Memorial Hospital in early February 2085 with a right MCA territory stroke characterized clinically by drooling and left hand weakness.  Fortunately, her symptoms have now resolved and she is back to her regular activities.  We understand that she has also had previous strokes.  In December 2082, she was suffering a dizzy spell and subsequently an MRI of her brain found a posterior circulation cerebellar infarct as well as a couple of basal ganglia lacunar infarct.  She recalls having only V2 clinical events.\n\nShe was worked up in the Griffin Memorial Hospital and had a Holter, which demonstrated normal sinus rhythm with minor ectopy only, an echocardiogram, which was reported as essentially normal with the exception of a positive saline contrast bubble study suggesting a patent foramen ovale, an MRI of her head which demonstrated the infarct and marked microvascular disease, as well as a CT angiogram of her head and neck arteries, which demonstrated mild atheroma for the most part with a left internal carotid artery stenosis that was less than 50%.  She is referred to us today for an opinion as to how to manage the possible patent foramen ovale.\n\nThis lady has never had cardiac problems otherwise.  There is no history of atrial fibrillation, coronary artery disease or congestive heart failure.  She does not get exertional chest discomfort (chest pain or shortness of breath) and has no history of syncope or presyncope.  She has no history of PND, orthopnea or edema.  She remains fairly active despite her ataxic gait.  She tells me that she is able to walk several blocks without difficulty and never has any exertional chest pains or shortness of breath.  Moreover, she does not have claudication.  Functional inquiry is otherwise unremarkable save for her usual difficulties with psoriasis and eczema.  She denies difficulties with heartburn or GI bleeding recently.\n\nPast Medical History:\n1.  Stroke.\nA.  Subcortical basal ganglia stroke.\nB.  Cerebellar stroke in December 2085 with subsequent ataxic gait.\nC.  Right MCA stroke with left hand weakness in February 2085.\n2.  Hypertension\n3.  Dyslipidemia.\n4.  Insulin insensitivity\n5.  Ex-smoker (1-1-1/2 packs per day for approximately 40 years, quit approximately 12 years ago).\n6.  Possible patent foramen ovale.\n7.  Degenerative joint disease/osteoarthritis.\nA.  Status bilateral total knee replacement in 2084.\nB.  Gastroesophageal reflux disease/hiatus hernia.\nC.  Status post GI bleeding (query secondary to esophagitis)\n8.  Osteoporosis.\n9.  Bladder incontinence.\n\nThere is no history of other cardiac problems.  There is no history of venous thromboembolic disease.  This lady has not had frank diabetes.\n\nAllergies:  She has no known drug allergies.\n\nCurrent Medical Therapy:\n1.  Aggrenox 25/200 p.o. b.i.d.\n2.  Prilosec 20 mg p.o. daily.\n3.  Doxepin 25 mg daily.\n4.  Simvastatin 40 mg p.o. daily.\n5.  Atenolol 12.5 mg p.o. daily.\n6.  Fosamax 70 mg every week.\n7.  BLANK 1 tab daily.\n8.  Darifenacin 7.5 mg daily.\n\nFamily History:  Betty Gillis is adopted and does not know very much about her biological parents.  She believes that her biological father suffered a stroke at some point, but cannot say for certain how old he was.\n\nSocial History:  This woman is single.  She is a retired Secretary.  She is an ex-smoker (more than 40 pack years), but does not drink significant amounts of alcohol.  She has no other history of substance abuse.\n\nReview of Systems:  Functional inquiry is positive for difficulties with psoriasis that are chronic and ongoing.  She has no other new symptoms.  There is no recent GI bleeding.  She has difficulties with bladder incontinence as well.\n\nOn physical examination today, her heart rate is 86 beats per minute and regular and her blood pressure is 122/78 in the right arm and 124/80 in the left arm.  Respiratory rate is 20 and she is pink on room air.  Head and neck exam is unremarkable.  There are no carotid bruits.  She has some kyphoscoliosis of her spine.  Her chest examination reveals no dullness to percussion and vesicular breath sounds only.  Her jugular venous pressure is not elevated.  Central pulses are normal in volume and contour.  Her apex beat is within normal limits.  Heart sounds include a normal S1 and S2 with no murmurs.  Her abdomen is soft and nontender.  There are no obvious masses.  Her aorta does not obviously appear to be enlarged.  Her pulses are palpable in her groin, but hard to feel behind her knees and distally.  They are symmetrical.  Informally, ABI test was not done today because she has several weeping eczematous lesions on her legs, which reflects psoriasis that has been excoriated.  A brief neurologic exam reveals dysmetria worse on the left than the right.\n\nImpression:  Betty Gillis has had at least four strokes and has documented evidence of atherosclerotic vascular disease and cerebromicrovascular disease on recent imaging.  We reviewed the echocardiogram today and we wished to confirm with the reading echocardiographer that it is indeed positive.  (It does not look particularly positive to our eyes).  Certainly, if she does not indeed have a patent foramen ovale, there is no issue as to what to do about it.  If she does have one; however, it seems more likely that her strokes reflect her atherosclerotic vascular disease secondary to her atherosclerotic risk factors and that the bulk of treatment should be directed at modulating those.\n\nHer hypertension is controlled today.  Her dyslipidemia is not bad.  However, the LDL is 76 and perhaps there is some added benefit to increasing her simvastatin to 80 mg p.o. daily.  We also note that she has had elevated glucoses in the past, as high as 191, as well as an elevated hemoglobin A1c up to 6.5.  It is probably worth having her screen formally to see whether or not she has type 2 diabetes mellitus versus insulin insensitivity only.  She may benefit from an oral hypoglycemic.\n\nWe recommend.\n1.  We will review the echocardiogram with the reading echocardiographer to ensure that it does indeed show a patent foramen ovale.\n2.  We suggest that she increase her statin from simvastatin 40 mg p.o. daily to simvastatin 80 mg p.o. daily.  We will leave this to her primary care physician to organize.\n3.  We suggest that she be screened formally for diabetes mellitus type 2.\n\nWe will see her again as necessary, but for the time being, we have no plans to perform an intervention on this lady.\n\n\n______________________________\nBobby Elston Braun, MD\n\n\n\n\n\neScription document:8-3518405 IFFocus\n\nCC: Michael John Boyle MD\n687 SCOTIA WAY\nBIG BEAR LAKE, CO 17347\n\n\nDD: 04/22/85\nDT: 04/23/85\nDV: 04/22/85\nRecord date: 2085-08-31\n\nEDVISIT^78865189^GILLIS, BETTY^08/31/85^GUEVARA, ELIZABETH\n\nThe patient was seen with Dr. Izaguirre.

While her deficits appear to have resolved, arguing against stroke, she clearly has multiple punctate foci of DWI hyperintensity that would be consistent with acute stroke. These strokes are in the PCA region and at the watershed region of the MCA/PCA and so could represent both anterior and posterior circulation emboli. Given that her carotid arteries are relatively clear, her heart or arch may be possible sources of embolus.\n\n- Has had stroke workup in the past that has been unrevealing\n\n- Would benefit from a repeat echocardiogram to assess for any new vegetations or thrombi\n\n- Would also benefit from repeat Holter to assess for paroxysmal atrial fibrillation\n\n- Admit to Internal Medicine service\n\n__________________________________\n\nVictor Q.

Not associated with any other symptoms.  A contractor who was at her home at the time called EMS who took pt to hospital.  En route she developed nausea and had 1 episode of NBNB emesis.  Otherwise, she denies CP, cough, fever, chills, abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting (other than the episode in the ambulance), change in bowel/bladder habits.  No exacerbating or alleviating symptoms.  Of note, she has some residual left sided weakness from her prior R MCA stroke and some balance issues from her cerebellar stroke.\n\n\n\nIn the ED the patient was tachypnic with SATS in the low 80s and  placed on oxygen by nasal cannula with improved sats on 4L to the mid 90s.  Then was able to be weaned to room air with sats still in the mid 90s.  She also was tachycardic to the 90s with BPs to the 90/60 with one episode of BP to 78 systolic.  She responded well to fluid with 2L in the ED and improved BPs.  CT showed stable RP and rectus sheath hematomas, no evidence of DVT or iliac thrombosis, and no evidence of PE.  CXR was clear.  \n\n\n\nOf note, following her hospitalization at PROMPTCARE in July 2087 for TIA where she was found to have a small PFO and iliac vein thrombosis, she was started on Coumadin.  However, the patient was recently admitted to GMH with rectus sheath and RP hematoma.  Per the patient, she received 8 U PRBC there.  She also received FFP and vitamin K to reverse her Coumadin.  During her hospitalization she was in the ICU for hypotension and tachycardia.  An IVC filter was placed initially but subsequently d/c&#8217;d on 8/26/87.  She was discharged off of anticoagulation.   \n\n\n\n\n\nPMH/PSH: \n\nR MCA stroke: 02/85\n\nR cerebellar stroke: 12/85\n\nOsteoarthritis s/p bilateral knee replacements\n\nGERD, chronic GI bleed with anemia\n\nHTN\n\nHLD\n\nBladder incontinence\n\n?Iliac vein thrombosis\n\nRectus sheath hematoma/Retroperitoneal hematoma\n\n\n\nMEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:\n\nOmeprazole 40 MG PO Daily\n\nAtenolol 12.5 MG PO Daily\n\nSimvastatin 40 MG PO Every night\n\nFerrous Sulfate 324 MG PO Two times a day\n\n\n\nALLERGIES: \n\nNKDA\n\n\n\nFHX: Unknown, adopted.\n\n       \n\n     \n\nSOCIAL HISTORY\n\nLives on her own in Big Bear Lake.

He has been very compliant with his \nmedication regimen which consists of metformin 850mg PO t.i.d. and NPH \ninsulin subQ q.AM.  He has had 2 episodes of sweating, but he did not \ncheck his blood sugar at the time.  He has not had any frank \npalpitations or lightheadedness.  He did have 1 episode where he had the \nsensation of several extra heart beats.  This was not accompanied by \nother symptoms including no chest pain.  He has never had a fingerstick \nblood glucose below the mid 150's.  I am looking through his log and see \nthat his AM prebreakfast glucoses have been between 178-306 and before \ndinner they have been between 157-296.  He has already met several times \nwith Makenzie Kim for diabetes education and for tailoring of his \ntherapy and has met with a nutritionist to review the concepts of a \ndiabetic diet.  \n \nOn physical exam, he is in no distress, his weight is 231, his blood \npressure is 132/78 in the right arm sitting.\n \nIMPRESSION AND PLAN: He still has high sugars. I will increase his \ninsulin regimen.  He is amenable to adding a second injection and so his \nnew regimen will be NPH insulin 15 units before breakfast and 15 units \nbefore bedtime.  And he continues to take metformin 850mg PO t.i.d. and \nI have given him a prescription for this, #90, refills 3, as well as \nsyringes and needles, #60, refills 3.  He is to follow up with me in \nseveral months and sooner if he has new problems or concerns.

He has been without it for a couple of days. He has \n\nhad no polyuria or polydipsia, and generally feels well. He has no chest \n\npain, shortness of breath - no abdominal discomfort. He has no problems \n\nwith is feet or eyesight. He has not seen an eye doctor in the past \n\nyear.\n\n\n\nMEDICATIONS:\n\nLisinopril, metformin, simvastatin, Glyburide.

The patient's eye pain began on 2 days prior to admission and has progressed to a severe stabbing pain that precipitated a visit to the MARY ED. The patient notes that her vision is more cloudy that usual although she does not see well out of that eye at baseline.  No right eye symptoms.   The patient also developed nausea and abdominal tenderness this AM.  The pain was mild.  She describes the pain as centered in her epigastrium.  She does not report chest pain or pressure and reports no symptoms of radiation to her shoulder or jaw.  She notes that the nausea is not associated with exercise or relieved by rest.  The discomfort has been constant since it began this am.  She denies hematemasis, fevers, chills, diarrhea.  The patient denies ever having chest pain or shortness of breath with exertion. \n\n\n\nIN the ED the patient was found to have a markedly elevated Intraocular pressure of 54.  She was treated with steroid, alpha blocker, Beta blocker drops and carbonic anhydrase inhibitors (both PO and drops) to lower her pressure.  The patient was thought to have acute closed angle glaucoma caused by proliferative diabetic retinopathy. \n\n\n\nPast Medical History:  \n\nDiabetes:  HemA1C 10.3 in Feb 2085.

On the lateral view only there is some increased patchy\n\n\topacity in the posterior clear space which could represent\n\n\tdeveloping atelectasis or, in the proper clinical setting, could\n\n\trepresent a subtle focus focus of pneumonia.  There is new\n\n\tblunting of the posterior costophrenic angles consistent with a\n\n\tsmall amount of pleural fluid.\n\n\n\nAbdominal Ultrasound:\n\nNEGATIVE STUDY.\n\n\n\nExercise Stress Test:\n\n  No ST segment changes were observed during this test.\n\n        Arrhythmias:\n\n          None.\n\n        Comments:\n\n        Fair exercise capacity. At peak exercise, patient complained of\n\n        indigestion feeling relieved by belching after several minutes.\n\n        Negative for ischemia.\n\n\n\nEKG: \n\nNSR.  New TWI in V2, q in III, normal axis and intervals, no ST changes\n\n\t          \t          \n\nASSESSMENT/PLAN:\n\n\n\nThe patient is a 74 yo female with poorly diabetes mellitus, hypertension, and hyperlipidemia who presents with acute closed angle glaucoma and nausea and vomiting. \n\n\n\n1.\tGlaucoma.\n\n\n\nLikely secondary to proliferative diabetic retinopathy.  As recommended by the ophthalmologic consultant, I will give the following meds\n\n\t-Xalatan qHS\n\n-Pred Forte QID\n\n-Timolol BID\n\n-Trusopt BID\n\n-Acetazolamide BID\n\n-Alphagan\n\nIOP will be monitored closely.  If it does not trend down, the patient may need surgery in the AM.\n\n\n\n2.\tNausea and Vomiting\n\n\n\nThe differential diagnosis is broad and includes symptoms related to glaucoma, atypical angina, symptoms from an SBO given her history, chemical pancreatitis and viral gastroenteritis.  Of these, I believe that symptoms from glaucoma or gastroenteritis is most likely.  \n\n-\tI ordered a KUB on the floor which showed normal bowel gas per unofficial rads read.  \n\n-\tI think angina is unlikely given her history.  However, I believe that she needs a stress test given her severe diabetes.  I will be unable to arrange one for tomorrow (weekend day), but I believe she needs one as an out patient study in the near future.  I will give ASA, B blocker and ACE.  I will not give heparin given that her TIMI score is only 1. \n\n-\tChemical pancreatitis is possible although her exam is so bengin. I will therefore give pt full liqs tonight and follow her for pancreatitis symptoms.\n\n\n\n3.\tChronic Renal Failure\n\n\n\nThis is likely secondary to diabetic nephropathy.

She has no face or leg weakness.\n\nSparing of face/leg suggests small embolic stroke to the corona radiata in L hemisphere where the motor fiber from face/arm/leg regions are most separated.  However, small capsular stroke is still a possibility.\n\nPatient is outside the time window for acute stroke intervention.\n\nRecommendations:\n-Head and neck MRI/MRA\n-If MRI shows a stroke, she will likely need to be admitted to RHR Neurology service for stroke workup including TTE, Holter, lipid panel, ESR, homocysteine, lipo(a), PT/OT.\n-Change from ASA to Aggrenox for stroke prevention.\n-Continue statin.\n-Hold off on her BP med for 24 hours, but likely OK to resume after 24 hours if the stroke size is small.\n\n\n\n\n\n________________________________\nYash Quaglia, M.D.\nNeurology Resident\nPager: 25347\nRecord date: 2090-06-29\n\n\nYasmine Florence-Gagnon, MD\nResident in Neurology\nBrookwood Nursing Home\n54 Mason Street\nWilliston, CO 36887\n\n\n\n\n\n\nXenia Rivas, NP\nSaint Olaf Hospital\n274 Mechanic Street\nCharlotte, CO 22812\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJune 29th, 2090\n\n\n\n\nDear Nurse Rivas, \n\n\nWe had the pleasure of seeing Ruath Doss (MRN 49535763) back in Neurology Clinic today for stroke and subsequent seizures.  The patient was seen by myself and Dr. Franklin Feliciano. \n\n\nRuath Doss is a 58yo RHF with a history of poorly controlled DM, htn, and hypercholesterolemia who is followed here in Neurology clinic for multiple small L frontoparietal strokes complicated by seizures.  She was last seen here March 4th, at which time she was having difficulty tasting food.  This finding was not replicated on clinical exam, and her exam was otherwise unremarkable; it was theorized that her symptoms may have been due to a drastic alteration in her diet.  Less likely possibilities included a viral illness and side effect of hydrochlorthiazide.  Otherwise, she had recovered well from her strokes, and had not had additional seizures.  \n\n\nMrs. Doss continues to do well.  She reports that her taste came back eventually; she did stop the hydrochlorthiazide under your direction, but is not sure if it was associated with the recovery of her taste.  She continues to eat healthfully, and in fact has lost 30 lbs since her hospitalization.  Via your office, she has completed a cardiac stress test as recommended after suffering a NSTEMI during her last hospitalization.  She has had an abdominal ultrasound which may have shown a gallstone, although she is unsure of the exact results.  Finally, she informs me that an appointment with Dr. Yuhas of Neurosurgery has been scheduled for August in order to follow up an incidental small L A2 aneurysm.  \n\n\nMrs. Doss continues to take Plavix for secondary stroke prevention (she has G6PD deficiency).  Her dentist would like to take her off this medication for a week before an extensive outpatient procedure which would include deep root cleaning.  However, she is nervous about the risk of another stroke.  She continues to tolerate her Dilantin well; there had been a question in April about a low level, but the test had been inadvertently performed in the setting of a held dose, and on repeat testing was within goal at 12.6.  She denies any seizure-like activity: no staring or shaking spells, or episodes of incontinence or tongue biting.  She reminds me that her 6 month anniversary of seizure free activity is approaching, and thus is hoping that she might be able to resume driving.  \n\n\nShe denies changes in vision, focal weakness or numbness, difficulty with language comprehension or production.  She does have occasional mild headaches exacerbated by the summer heat.  She sometimes feels as though she has \"creepy crawly things in my head,\" a sensation similar to when she had a Mohs procedure.  \n\n\n\n\n\nMeds:  \natenolol 50mg po qday\nLipitor 80mg po qday\nClopidogrel 75mg po qday\nGlipizide 5mg po qday\nCozaar 100mg po qday\nMetformin 500mg po bid\nDilantin 200mg qam / 300mg qpm\nValtrex prn\nAcyclovir ointment\n\n\nPhysical Examination:\n\n\nMS:       Alert, appropriately interactive, normal affect.

She is overall doing very well, and has been very meticulous with her healthcare after her hospitalizations in December.  We discussed the very small risk of stroke if Plavix is held for a dental procedure.  The daily risk of stroke is so small, and the benefit of proper mouth care so great, that we would agree with holding clopidogrel.  If she does not want to stop antiplatelet medication before the procedure, the only alternative would be a heparin or Lovenox bridge.  However, such a measure would seem to be extreme, especially as her overwhelming stroke risk factors at the time of the CVA were her diabetes, hypertension, and hypercholesterolemia, all of which she has taken significant strides to better control.  Mrs. Doss was still nervous about suspending the Plavix; ultimately, she will decide on the optimal course of action.  \n\n\nMrs. Doss will have repeat cholesterol panel tested at your office to assess her response to the increased dose Lipitor and dietary changes.  Her lipoprotein(a) level was high at 89 at the time of her hospitalization, and we will repeat this lab today to ascertain whether it has remained elevated.  I have also written her a letter certifying that, as of July 3rd, she will have been seizure free for 6 months time on a stable dose of Dilantin.  She emphasizes that she would call my office or go to the Emergency Department immediately if there she were to have any seizure-like episodes.  If she remains event free for two years, we may consider discontinuing her antiepileptic medication.  \n\n\nAlthough the incidentally noted L A2 aneurysm is reassuringly stable on CTA, I have asked her to confirm her follow up appointment with Neurosurgery, as I do not see the date noted in the computer.  Finally, we will obtain a repeat carotid ultrasound this fall to ensure that the irregular R ICA plaque has not progressed.  \nOf note, Dr. Franklin Feliciano was present for all of the salient aspects of the history and physical exam. Together, we discussed with the patient the work-up and treatment plan.  Thank you for allowing us to participate in the care of your patient. I will see her back in clinic in 4-6 months time.   \n\n\n\n\nSincerely, \n\n\n\n\nYasmine Florence-Gagnon, MD\nEducare-Pullman Neurology\nRecord date: 2090-09-25\n\nEDVISIT^49535763^DOSS, RUATH^09/25/90^GILMORE, RACHEL\n\nThe patient was seen in conjunction with resident, Dr. Xiang. \n\nResident's note was reviewed.  The patient was seen and examined\n\nby me.  Please see the resident's note for details of the\n\npatient's past medical, social, family history, review of\n\nsystems, and physical exam.\n\nCHIEF COMPLAINT:  Tingling and numbness.\n\nHISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 58-year-old woman with a\n\nhistory of stroke and seizure in 12/2089 and a longstanding\n\nhistory of diabetes who presents today with a sharp thumbtack\n\npoking sensation in her right hand at 9:30 a.m. while driving. \n\nIt lasted 3-4 seconds and then completely resolved.  Thirty\n\nminutes later, she noticed a similar sensation in her right hand\n\nfor a few seconds and then resolved completely, and then she\n\nnoticed it in her right foot and the toes.  She wiggles her toes\n\nin her shoe and then that resolved after a few seconds and then\n\n30 minutes after that she had a similar but less severe sensation\n\nin the fingertips of her left hand at about 10:45 that then\n\nresolved completely.  Since then, she has had no sensation like\n\nthis.  She has had pins and needles feeling in her hands and feet\n\nin the past, but never a sharp thumbtack feeling like this in the\n\npast.  She had no dysarthria, confusion, weakness, numbness\n\ntrauma, dizziness, loss of consciousness, syncope, seizure\n\nactivity, changes in her medications, or any new medications. \n\nShe took her Plavix as usual this morning, is now symptom free,\n\nand very well appearing.  She called her doctor's office and the\n\nnurse told her to come to the Emergency Department to be checked.\n\nPAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Hypertension, diabetes, high cholesterol,\n\nseizures in the setting of a stroke in 12/2089, and a left MCA\n\nstroke in 12/2089.  She has had no seizures since then.  She has\n\nresidual right lower extremity weakness, which is now much\n\nimproved.  Echo in 12/2089 showed an EF of 60%.  She has\n\nconcentric LVH, no wall motion abnormalities, and no other\n\nsurgeries.\n\nSOCIAL HISTORY:  Past smoker of 30 pack years, ETOH none, and no\n\nIV drug use.  She works as a Business Services Manager and lives\n\nwith her family.\n\nFAMILY HISTORY:  Noncontributory.\n\nREVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  Otherwise, negative.\n\nMEDICATIONS:  She takes Dilantin, glipizide, Glucophage, Plavix,\n\natenolol, Cozaar, and Lipitor.\n\nALLERGIES:  None.\n\nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  She is afebrile with normal and stable\n\nvital signs.  Awake, alert, and in no distress.  Her exam is\n\ncompletely unremarkable including 5/5 strength in her upper and\n\nlower extremities.  Gait is normal.  She has no cerebellar signs,\n\npast pointing dysmetria, aphasia, ataxia, focal weakness, or any\n\nfocal sensory deficit at all.\n\nLABORATORY DATA:  EKG shows bradycardia at 50 beats a minute with\n\nnonspecific T-wave changes.  Fingerstick is 150.  Dilantin level\n\nis normal.  Head CT shows no evidence of bleeding or any other\n\nabnormality.\n\nEMERGENCY DEPARTMENT COURSE:  Neurology was consulted and agrees\n\nwith the diagnosis of likely peripheral neuropathy.  They will\n\nhelp arrange followup within 1 week for this patient with her\n\nneurologist and she is told to see her primary care physician\n\nwithin 2 weeks and to return to the Emergency Department for any\n\nchest pain, shortness of breath, or any other worsening of her\n\nsymptoms.\n\nDISPOSITION:  She is well appearing at the time of discharge in\n\nsatisfactory condition.\n\n______________________________\n\nGILMORE, RACHEL M.D.\n\nD: 09/25/90\n\nT: 09/25/90\n\nDictated By: GILMORE, RACHEL\n\neScription document:1-9359833 BFFocus\n\n ******** Not reviewed by Attending Physician ********\nRecord date: 2092-05-09\n\n\nYasmine Florence-Gagnon, MD\n\nResident in Neurology\n\nBrookwood Nursing Home\n\n05 Mason Street\n\nWilliston, CO 36887\n\n\n\n\n\n\nXenia Rivas, NP\n\nSaint Olaf Hospital\n\n703 Mechanic Street\n\nCharlotte, CO 22812\n\n\n\n\n\nMay 9th, 2092\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDear Nurse Rivas, \n\n\n\n\nWe had the pleasure of seeing Ruath Doss (MRN 49535763) back in Neurology Clinic today for stroke and subsequent seizures.

She had recovered well from her strokes, and has been seizure-free for two years on Dilantin.  She was last seen here in December 2091. \nSince that visit, she has had several significant health-related events: her breast biopsy was found to be negative, and she also underwent clipping of her incidentally found L ACA aneurysm via bifrontal craniotomy.  Dr. Gertrude Fulton performed this procedure in February which was uneventful.  However, an abdominal aortic aneurysm was found on an ultrasound for abdominal pain (attributed to biliary colic), so she is being followed for increase in size of the aneurysm as well as for any new cerebral aneurysms.  \n\n\n\nMrs. Doss still has some occasional burning pain over her right incision site, helpd with rubbing the area.  She had some bilateral lateral thigh numbness after the surgery, a recrudescence of old symptoms which improved after a bowel movement but which have not yet completely resolved.  She denies any recent seizures.

Her clinical examination remains intact.  She has been seizure free for two years at this point, including through intracranial surgery, and she is amenable to a trial of tapering off the Dilantin.  Given that her seizures occurred within a week of her stroke, and that her EEG at that time did not show epileptiform discharges, she is a good candidate for AED discontinuation.  Before doing so, we will obtain a baseline EEG to assess for cortical irritability.  Such an abnormality may be difficult to detect given her craniotomy; if the breech is significant, she would be a candidate for a MEG study.  If there are no epileptiform discharges, we can institute a taper off the Dilantin (decrease by 100mg every 5 days).  After she has been off the Dilantin for two weeks, we will again repeat an EEG.  She is aware that she will not be able to drive for 6 months after the Dilantin is stopped, and that there is an increased risk of seizures especially in the first 3 months.  \n\n\n\nWe discussed the importance of weight loss, as well as continued good diabetic, hypertensive, and lipid control for stroke prevention.  The weight loss will likely help resolve her meralgia paresthetica as well.  (It is not entirely clear how the constipation related to her symptoms.)  Given the new irregularity on her most recent carotid ultrasound, we will repeat the study once more to ensure that there has been no progression.  Mrs. Doss will call me after her EEG and carotid ultrasound have been completed so that we can discuss the results, and also to determine whether to taper off the Dilantin.  \n\n\n\nOf note, Dr. Isaac Ferraro was present for all of the salient aspects of the history and physical exam. Together, we discussed with the patient the work-up and treatment plan.  Thank you for allowing us to continue to participate in the care of your patient.  As I am graduating from the residency program, she will be seen by a different resident in 6 months time.     \n\n\n\n\n\nSincerely, \n\n\n\n\n\n\nYasmine Florence-Gagnon, MD\n\nEducare-Pullman Neurology"}

She is regularly being followed by Dr. Jarvis, Nephrologist at Salvation Army Hospital, was seen there about two months ago and will return there in June.  She is also treated for her chronic anemia with darbopoetin.  The patient recently has noticed that her blood sugars have decreased progressively, and she has had several episodes of near hypoglycemia.  Blood sugars are often 60 or less.  The patient also complains of pain in her right middle finger and right shoulder pain.\n\n\n\nPhysical examination reveals an elderly female in no acute distress.  Blood pressure is 142/60, weight is 176 pounds, and pulse is 96.  Glucose done in the exam room today was 110.  Chest is clear bilaterally.  Heart: Regular rate and rhythm, positive S1, S2, negative S3, S4, and no murmur.  Abdomen is soft, nontender, and positive bowel sounds.  Lower extremities: No edema and nontender.  Right hand tenderness in the first metacarpophalangeal joint and the overlying tendon and also tenderness diffusely in the right shoulder pain with grossly normal range of motion.\n\n\n\nIMPRESSION AND PLAN:\n\n1.  Diabetes mellitus.  The patient's blood sugars have been dropping.  The patient has decreased her glipizide already from 20 mg daily to 10 mg daily.  I will further decrease it to 5 mg daily.  Check hemoglobin A1c today as well as ALT, AST, and creatinine.\n\n2.  Chronic renal failure.  The patient's creatinine clearance is about 15-17, and the patient is approaching end-stage renal failure.  She is being followed by the Renal Department at Salvation Army Hospital, and dialysis is being considered for the midterm management of the patient.\n\n3.  Tendonitis, right middle finger.  After the patient's informed consent was obtained, the area was prepared in the usual sterile fashion, and 1% lidocaine along with 0.2 cc of Depo-Medrol was injected in the area of the flexor POLLICIS longus tendon sheath.  The patient tolerated the procedure well.\n\n4.  Anemia.  This is obviously due to the patient's chronic renal disease.  She has been receiving darbepoetin injections, initially weekly, then every other week, and now every three weeks.  We will check CBC today.\n\n5.  Right shoulder pain.  The patient cannot take nonsteroidals due to her renal problem, so I have given her a prescription for Tylenol with Codeine, of which she may take one or one-half tablet as needed to control the pain.\n\n6.  Regular healthcare maintenance.  The patient will follow up with me in about two months.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n______________________________\n\nInfant Brewer, MD\n\n\n\n\n\nDictated By: Infant Brewer\n\n\n\n\n\neScription document:2-5091452 EMSSten Tel\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDD: 05/25/79\n\nDT: 05/26/79\n\nDV: 05/25/79\nRecord date: 2079-11-09\n\n\n\nCocke County Baptist Hospital\n\n0295 Keats Street                                      GLENN, OLIVIA\n\nWhitewater, NC 13662                                      10776605\n\n(545) 266-9272                                           11/09/79\n\n\n\n\n\nHISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 65-year-old female who returns to the clinic for a complete physical examination.\n\n\n\nPAST MEDICAL HISTORY:\n\n1.

I confirm that I have interviewed and examined the\n\npatient, reviewed the resident's documentation on the patient's\n\nchart, and discussed the evaluation, plan of care, and\n\ndisposition with the patient.\n\nCHIEF COMPLAINT:  A 65-year-old female with difficulty breathing.\n\nHISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient with known multiple\n\nmedical problems presents with difficulty breathing.  At her\n\nrehabilitation facility was noted to be hypoxic and thus was sent\n\nhere.  The patient's recent past medical history is remarkable\n\nfor a fall with cervical fractures, rib fractures, and subsequent\n\nhemothorax for which she was admitted to the Educare-Pullman ICU over the\n\nend of December through the beginning of January.  The patient's\n\nchest tube was withdrawn approximately 10 days ago and the\n\npatient has been doing well at rehab since.  However, today was\n\nnoted to have desaturations to 80% on room air.  She had\n\nshortness of breath as well.  Her oxygen saturations improved\n\nmarginally on oxygenation and have been responsive to\n\nnonrebreather treatment in the transport here.  The patient was\n\ntreated with nebulizers and Lasix without significant improvement\n\nand is noted to be quite tachypneic.\n\nPAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Remarkable for hypertension, CHF,\n\ndiabetes, asthma, chronic renal insufficiency, osteoporosis,\n\nanemia, and cervical fracture.\n\nSOCIAL HISTORY, FAMILY HISTORY, AND REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  Limited\n\nby the severity of the patient's presentation.\n\nMEDICATIONS:  Insulin, Zocor, PhosLo, calcium carbonate,\n\nProtonix, Niferex, Norvasc, Fosamax, Epogen, Lasix, lisinopril,\n\nColace, and Xalatan.\n\nALLERGIES:  Morphine and aspirin.\n\nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  The patient is awake and alert, in some\n\ndegree of respiratory distress, however, able to interact and\n\nanswer questions in 1-2 word sentences.  Vital signs are as\n\ndocumented with an elevated blood pressure of 176/96, pulse 76,\n\nand oxygen saturation is 98% on nonrebreather.  HEENT exam is\n\natraumatic, normal to inspection.  The patient has a large tongue\n\nand her uvula is not visible at all.  Neck is immobilized in a\n\nC-collar and is obese.  Respiratory exam reveals decreased breath\n\nsounds diffusely with tachypnea and respiratory muscle accessory\n\nuse.  Cardiovascular exam:  Regular rate and rhythm without\n\nmurmur.  Pulses are palpable in all four extremities.  Abdomen is\n\nsoft and nontender, obese, but without any organomegaly or\n\nmasses, or guarding, or rebound.  Skin is intact, warm, and dry\n\nwithout any lesions or rash.  Musculoskeletal exam reveals\n\ntenderness over the right ribs where the patient has known rib\n\nfractures.  Neurologically, she is oriented with difficulty\n\nspeaking due to respiratory distress but no focal neurologic\n\ndeficit.\n\nLABORATORY STUDIES:  BNP is elevated in the 500-600 range.  White\n\nblood count is slightly elevated at 10, hematocrit 26.3, which is\n\nat the patient's baseline, and creatinine of 2.2.  LFTs within\n\nnormal limit.  INR 1.2.  D-dimer significantly elevated.  EKG\n\ndemonstrates sinus rhythm with nonspecific ST-T wave changes.\n\nIMAGING STUDIES:  Chest x-ray shows bilateral effusions, which\n\nare present previously but possibly slightly increased.\n\nEMERGENCY DEPARTMENT COURSE:  The patient was initially given\n\nLasix and nitro with improvement in her blood pressure and was\n\nalso started on CPAP.  She seemed to be improving clinically for\n\nsome period of time but then began to decline in her mental\n\nstatus.  At that time an ABG was sent demonstrating hypoxia. \n\nPrior to those results, the decision was made that the patient\n\nlikely needed intubation.  We had hope to hold off to do a\n\nthoracentesis; however, the patient's clinical course declines\n\nsuch that it was not possible for her to sit up for the\n\nprocedure.  On CPAP, the patient's oxygen saturations were stable\n\nthroughout in the 90s, but she developed increasing respiratory\n\ndistress.  Intubation was complicated by her inability to flex\n\nher neck, her large tongue, and her body habitus; was successful\n\nin two attempts with one episode of bag mask ventilation in\n\nbetween those attempts.  For full details of the procedure,\n\nplease see the attached procedure note.  Thoracic Surgery was\n\nconsulted.  They arrived as the patient was being intubated.  At\n\nthis time their recommendation is for a CT scan of the chest to\n\ndetermine whether this is more likely a hemothorax or a pleural\n\neffusion and whether it is loculated.  This study will be\n\nperformed and then patient will be admitted to her ready bed in\n\nthe ICU.  A bedside ultrasound was also performed by myself and\n\nthe resident demonstrating no obvious pericardial effusion.\n\n ******** Not reviewed by Attending Physician ********\n\nPRIMARY DIAGNOSIS:  Bilateral pleural effusions.\n\nSECONDARY DIAGNOSIS:  Respiratory distress.\n\nTERTIARY DIAGNOSIS:  Question recurrent hemothorax versus pleural\n\neffusion.\n\nFOURTH DIAGNOSIS:  Question CHF.\n\nDISPOSITION:  Admitted to the ICU.\n\nCRITICAL CARE TIME:  75 minutes.\n\n______________________________\n\nWOODRUFF, FERNE MD\n\nD: 01/14/80\n\nT: 01/14/80\n\nDictated By: WOODRUFF, FERNE\n\neScription document:9-3389642 BFFocus\nRecord date: 2080-04-15\n\nEDVISIT^10776605^GLENN, OLIVIA^04/15/80^URIBE, HAROLD\n\nSeen by me along with Dr. Oglesby on 04/15/2080.

The patient was in her usual state of \nhealth until one week ago, when she developed an upper respiratory \ntract infection.  She was seen by her primary care physician, who \ntreated her with Biaxin.  The patient took the Biaxin; however, she \ndeveloped some epigastric abdominal pain on Tuesday.  She called \nher primary care physician, who attributed her abdominal pain to a \nBiaxin reaction.  She was told to discontinue the Biaxin on Thursday. \nThe patient denies any fevers, chills, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, \nor constipation.  She denies any dysuria, polyuria, or hematuria. \nShe denies any vaginal discharge.  She denies any shortness of \nbreath or chest pain.  She denies any arm, jaw, or back pain.  She \ndenies any diaphoresis or dizziness.  She does admit to some \nburping and indigestion. \nShe describes the pain as cramping in nature.  It waxes and wanes. \nIt does not radiate anywhere.  Nothing seems to improve or worsen \nthe pain. \nREVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  As per HPI, and otherwise negative.  In \nparticular, on cardiovascular review, she denies chest pain, arm \npain, jaw pain, or back pain; she denies any diaphoresis, \ndizziness, nausea, vomiting, dyspnea on exertion, or palpitations. \nOn pulmonary, she admits to cough, but denies hemoptysis.  The \nabdominal review is as per the HPI; she denies melena.  The GU \nreview is as per HPI. \nPAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  (1) Type I diabetes mellitus; (2) \nHypertension; (3) Hypothyroidism; (4) Asthma; (5) Current upper \nrespiratory tract infection. \nMEDICATIONS:  Albuterol inhaler; glucophage; insulin; codeine. \nSOCIAL HISTORY AND FAMILY HISTORY:  Negative tobacco.  The family \nhistory is negative for diabetes mellitus. \nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  On physical examination, the vital signs \nreveal a temperature of 98.6 degrees F., a blood pressure of \n146/74, a pulse of 88, and a respiratory rate of 20.  The O2 \nsaturation is 96% on room air.  In general, the patient is in no \nacute distress.  The HEENT examination reveals the head to be \nnormocephalic; the examination is atraumatic.  EOMI.  PERLA.  The \nthroat is clear.  The neck is supple, with no JVD or bruits.  The \nchest shows no crepitus or retractions.  The lungs have coarse \nbreath sounds.  The heart has a regular rhythm and rate without \nmurmurs, rubs, or gallops.  The abdomen is soft, with some very \nmild epigastric tenderness, but no guarding, rebound, referred \npain, flank tenderness, palpable masses, or pulsatile masses.  The \nextremities are warm and well-perfused without cyanosis, clubbing, \nor edema.  On neurologic, there are no focal findings. \nLABORATORY EVALUATION:  The chest x-ray shows no acute pathology. \nThe EKG shows a normal sinus rhythm at 90. \nTHERAPY RENDERED/COURSE IN ED:  The working diagnosis was peptic \nulcer disease exacerbation versus gastritis versus non-specific \nabdominal pain.  The patient was status post cholecystectomy five \nyears ago.  She was afebrile and hemodynamically stable.  She did \nnot exhibit any stigmata of an acute coronary syndrome; however, \ngiven her history of diabetes mellitus and her age, an EKG was \nobtained and revealed a normal sinus rhythm at 90, without any \nischemic or infarctive changes.  She was medicated with 30 cc of \nMaalox and 150 mg of Axid, which seemed to improve her pain \nconsiderably.  Serial abdominal examinations did not reveal any \nperitoneal signs or worsening abdominal pain.  The patient did not \nhave any medical records on the computer at this time.  Nursing and \nTriage notes were reviewed and I concur in those findings. \nFINAL DIAGNOSIS:  Abdominal pain, suspect gastritis versus peptic \nulcer disease. \nDISPOSITION (including condition upon discharge):  The patient was \ngiven abdominal pain instructions in Spanish.  She was given a \nprescription for Axid and for Maalox.  She was to follow up with \nher primary care physician the next day and return if symptoms were \nto recur or worsen.  She was discharged in improved and stable \ncondition. \n___________________________________                    JK917/8117 \nMIGUEL LARSON, M.D. ML60                              D:02/13/62 \n                                                       T:02/14/62 \nDictated by:  MIGUEL LARSON, M.D. ML60\nRecord date: 2069-10-22\n\nEDVISIT^63107921^RILEY, MARY^10/22/2069^VOLLMER, NATHAN\n\nSeen by Dr. Thrasher and seen and examined by me.\n\nCHIEF COMPLAINT:  Shortness of breath.\n\nCurrently, being admitted to Internal Medicine.\n\nHISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This 66-year-old woman with a\n\nsignificant medical history including hypothyroidism, history of\n\nhigh cholesterol, diabetes type 1, hypertension and history of\n\nmyocardial infarction in the past and status post cholecystectomy\n\nwho presents now with palpitations and shortness of breath.

She had an extensive cardiovascular work-up that showed no signs of cardiac ischemia.  Her MIBI showed no evidence of scar or ischemia and an ejection fraction of 57%.  On the other hand, her blood sugars were found to be in the 300-400s.  Since then, she has been followed by the IM dept.  She comes in today complaining of 2 main symptoms that have been occuring for several months now, and which in large part led to her recent hospitalization: 1) dyspnea that occurs on average twice a week, allevaited after 30 min of SL NTG, no precipitating factors identified.  SOB not significantly imporved by albuterol.  2) neck pain, localized to the lateral aspects of her neck.  She feels \"her veins exploding\".  Of note, she suffered left ankle pain, for which she self-medicated cephalexin (without knowing its an Abx), which she had at home.  She says most of her symptoms resolved.  Per her husband, she has always been a fairly anxious person.  \n\n\n\nROS: No DOE, no PND, no fever.  Good apetite, polydypsia.

Her symptoms are quite vague and difficult to put together.  Importantly, myocardial ischemia has been ruled out by cardiac nucelar imaging.  My two main differentials are 1) general anxiety, 2) GERD.  Even though she does have a h/o COPD, but based on her history, physical exam and lack of efficacy of bronchodilators in releiveing her symptoms, I don't believe major underlying lung disease explans her symtoms.   We'll start her on klonopin 0.5 mg and fluoxetine 10 mg po qd.  Follow-up with LIMA psychiatry clinic for management of anxiety.\n\n\n\nIn terms of her glucose, she is improving, but still not adequately controlled.  She occasionally has blurry vision and is constantly thirsty.  Her next appointment is in January.  HBA1c yesterday=9.2, fasting glucose in the 200s.  Last increase in her insluin was in 11/30/69, from 80 U QAM to 90 U QPM.  For now, we'll increase her PM dose of insulin from 70 to 75 U SC QAM, and follow-up with her.. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n      \n\n========================== Preceptor's Note ==========================\n\nDiscussed with Dr. Freddie Eric. 66 yo woman with poorly controlled DM.

On this regimen, her morning blood sugars have ranged \nPre-breakfast: 96-214, mostly 100-130.\nPre (sometimes post) Dinner: 128-307, mostly 140-160\n\nThe good news is her last A1c dropped to 7.2% from 8.3% (1 year ago was 10.4%)\n\nShe has known retinopathy and has had multiple laser treatments.  She goes routinely to the ophthalmologist, at least twice a year and several times a year to the podiatrist as well. She is otherwise in good health, though today she complains of depressed mood, for which she is in therapy. \n\nOn ROS she denies any chest pain, shortness of breath, dizziness, nausea, polyuria, polydipsia, fevers, chills, diarrhea, vaginal or urinary symptoms, numbness or tingling of her lower extremities.  She has not had any hypoglycemia.  She does not exercise.\n\nPAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Status post total thyroidectomy (because of large goiter) on levothyroxine 200 mcg daily. COPD, obesity, CHF (EF 40%), hypertension, hyperlipidemia, GERD, sleep apnea, status post cholecystectomy.\n\nCURRENT MEDICATIONS:  Albuterol inhaler, Ambien, atenolol 50 mg daily, clonidine 0.2 mg b.i.d., aspirin 81 mg daily, Flovent b.i.d., levothyroxine 200 mcg p.o. daily, lisinopril 20 mg daily, Nexium 40 mg daily, Singulair 10 mg p.o. daily and Lipitor 20 mg p.o. nightly, Metormin 1000 mg BID, Lasix 20 mg daily.\n\nSOCIAL HISTORY:  Ms. Riley is from Mexico.  She has lived here for the last 15 years and denies tobacco or alcohol.  \n\nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  She is a well-appearing overweight woman.  Blood pressure 117/57, pulse 87, weight 210 down fr 212 last visit, fingersticks 247 postprandial, reports took lispro today.  Extremities, no edema, well perfused with palpable pulses.  No ulcerations or skin breakdown. Microfilament and vibratory sensation intact.  \n\nPREVIOUS DATA:  Labs from 11/22/70: TSH 0.137.  Microalbumin was negative.  Cholesterol was 109, LDL 40, HDL 36, TG 163 A1c 7.2%, down from 8.3% on 7/31/2070 \n\nIMPRESSION AND PLAN:  In summary, Ms. Riley is a 67-year-old woman with type 2 diabetes for the last 20 years with poor glycemic control, but significant improvement recently, with latest hemoglobin A1c of 7.2%.\n\n1.  Diabetes.  Her sugars are much improved, as is her A1c. We will switch her 70/30 regular to 70/30 Novolog, given that she gives herself the insulin just after the meals and that she is using Novolog for lunch as well. We emphasized again the pm dose should NOT be pre-bed but pre-dinner.  She will continue dose of 90 units QAM and Qdinner of 70/30 and Lispro 25U for lunch. She will continue on metformin 1000 mg twice daily. She will continue to follow up with Opthalmology and Podiatry.  Her blood pressure is in target range on clonidine and lisinopril.  Her LDL is also in target range on Lipitor.   She will continue on a baby aspirin. Her microalbumin is negative.   \n\n2.  Hypothyroidism.  TSH somewhat suppressed, 0.137, will therefore reduce levothyroxine to 175 mcg QD\n\nShe will follow up in 3-4 month's time.  \n\n\n\n_____________________________________________\nWinnie Palacios, M.D.\nRecord date: 2072-05-24\n\n\nCC: routine f/u \n\n\nHPI:\n69 F with DM, CHF with preserved EF, GIB from a small bowel source, and diffuse body aches.\n\n\nShe has been feeling quite well recently, and states her shortness of breath seems better during the spring/summer.

He was seen in the emergency room on 10/21 with the \n\ncomplaint of urinary frequency, hesitancy, and generally not feeling well. \n\nPrior to that, he had been treated with antibiotics by his primary care \n\nphysician for a urinary tract infection with Bactrim and then ampicillin but \n\nhe did not get better. He went to the emergency room and was admitted to the \n\nhospital because his blood sugar was in the 400s and he was diagnosed with \n\ndiabetes at that time. He was discharged on 10/22/78 on insulin NPH 30 units \n\nin \n\nthe morning and 15 units in the PM and was advised to follow up in the \n\noutpatient clinic today. Since discharge, his blood sugars have been in the \n\n200s. This afternoon, it is 242 2 hours after his last meal.\n\n \n\nPast Medical History: He has a history of benign prostatic hypertrophy. He \n\nsees a urologist and they are discussing a new procedure for the same. He \n\ncannot have ______ because of his morbid obesity, he cannot be positioned on \n\nthe table for the same. He also gives a history of sleep apnea. No \n\nhypertension. He does have a history of gastric reflux and obesity.\n\n \n\nPast Surgical History: He has had bilateral hip surgery for slipped ______ as \n\nan adolescent.\n\n \n\nReview of Systems: No chest pain. Positive review of systems for UTI symptoms \n\nwith increased frequency and hesitancy. Other review of systems-he has \n\narthritis generalized with more pain in the hip. Also has acid reflux.\n\n \n\nFamily History: Family history of obesity and hypertension but no diabetes or \n\ncoronary artery disease.\n\n \n\nSocial History: He is a smoker but is trying to quit. He smokes less than one \n\npack a day. He is a manager and is on disability. He has 2 children and is \n\nseparated.\n\n \n\nPhysical Examination: He is morbidly obese and weighs about 405 pounds. Blood \n\npressure 110/88. Pulse 84. Skin exam-there is evidence of acanthosis \n\nnigricans. He has gynecomastia. Head and neck exam-atraumatic, normocephalic. \n\nExtraocular movements are intact. Pupils equal, round and reactive to light. \n\nCardiovascular system exam-S1, S2 heard. No S3, S4. Respiratory system-clear \n\nto auscultation and percussion. No added sounds. Abdomen-obese, very \n\ndifficult \n\nto examine for masses or hepatosplenomegaly. On limited exam, there are no \n\nmasses palpable. CNS-cranial nerves II-XII intact. Examination of feet with \n\nmonofilament is negative as he is not able to feel the monofilament in both \n\nfeet. This impairment is greater on the right foot than left.\n\n \n\nLabs done so far:  hemoglobin A1c of 14, glucose on 10/21 422, creatinine 1.7, \n\nBUN 22, sodium 132, potassium 4.5, chloride 97, liver function tests with ALT \n\n10, AST 10, alkaline phosphatase 126, bilirubin 0.4, total protein 8.1, \n\nalbumin 3.6, globulin 4.5, calcium 9.5, hemoglobin 15.\n\n \n\nAssessment and Plan: 1. New onset diabetes mellitus. The patient is morbidly \n\nobese, has features of insulin resistance. His blood sugars today are better \n\nsince admission. He is on insulin twice a day. He checks his blood sugars 3 \n\ntimes a day and since discharge, they have been around 240 to 300. The \n\npatient \n\nis not a good candidate for metformin with his last creatinine of 1.7. He may \n\nbe a candidate for Avandia. At the present time, his alkaline phosphatase is \n\nmildly elevated but his ALT and AST are normal. He has difficulty coming to \n\nthe clinic and would prefer to have his visiting nurse and nutritionist \n\ncommunicate with the clinic physicians to adjust the dose of his insulin and \n\nalso have his blood tests done locally rather than here in the clinic. We \n\nwill \n\nincrease his NPH to 40 units in the morning and 26 units in the PM. We will \n\nwork with the visiting nurse and nutritionist to adjust the insulin dose and \n\nalso order lab tests. We will repeat his hemoglobin A1c in a month and also \n\nrepeat his creatinine and liver function tests at that time to see if he may \n\nbe a candidate for Avandia. I advised the patient to return to the clinic in \n\n6 \n\nmonths and also for him to send the blood sugar results every week until his \n\nblood sugars are under better control.\n\n \n\n____________________________\n\nDr. Xan Dunn\n \n\nXD:ullmann\n\n \n\nDD: 10.25.78/Rec=d 11.04.78\nDT: 12.03.78\n\nDV: 10.25.78\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n ******** Not reviewed by Attending Physician ********\nRecord date: 2080-07-03\n\n\n\nHistory of Present Illness\n\nPOD # 3 \n\nProcedure  femoral-femoral bypass graft   \n\nSurgeon    U.

Mr. Lockwood has been generally feeling well and has no complaints except ongoing left lower extremity edema in the foot only, which is unchanged times many years.  He has otherwise been feeling relatively well.  He continues to be followed by Dr. Aguilera who prefers to take a conservative approach given the difficulty of performing a bone marrow biopsy and low levels of IgA paraprotein.\n\nReview of systems is negative except as above.  Fingersticks remain well controlled in the range of 80-150s.\n\nInterval family, social, and medical history are unchanged.\n\nCurrent Medications:  Include lisinopril 20 once a day, Proscar 5 once a day, Flomax, aspirin 325 once a day, atenolol 25 once a day, trazodone, folate, MVI, saw palmetto, glucosamine, selenium, vitamin C and vitamin D, Lipitor 20 mg once a day, and Plavix 75 once a day.\n\nPhysical Exam:  Well-developed, obese in no apparent distress.  BP 169/83 and pulse 58.  Neck:  Supple without JVP or lymphadenopathy.  Chest:  Clear to auscultation and percussion.  Cardiovascular exam:  S1 and S2 without murmurs, rubs, or gallops.  Extremities:  No edema, warm.\n\nLaboratory Data:  Recent BUN and creatinine 18 and 1.5.  Repeat labs will be done when he comes in next week for his routine labs at the SCH.  Skeletal films are pending.\n\nImpression:  Mr. Lockwood chronic kidney disease appears to be stable, as I have mentioned before, he most likely has some underlying diabetic and/or hypertensive nephropathy, but I continue to wonder whether the IgA paraprotein is playing a role in the increasing proteinuria and mild CKD. Chemotherapy would be indicated if that were the case..  He is being followed conservatively by Dr. Aguilera thus far in the absence of defniitive data.  I have ordered skull and hip films today to look for evidence of myeloma-related bone disease, which if present could distinguish  more significant disease from MGUS.  I  agree with Dr. Altman  that in the absence of definitive data,as long as creatinine is improving and urinary protein levels remain stable  the current approach is  reasonable.  However, we should have a low threshold for pushing Mr. Lockwood to having either a renal or more preferably bone marrow biopsy.\n\nIn the meantime because he continues to have protein and albumin in his urine, I have initiated dual angiotensin blockade and have added Cozaar 25 mg a day to his regimen.

Please see his note for\n\nfull details.\n\nHISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  A 67-year-old female who presents to\n\ntriage complaining of substernal chest pain, diaphoretic.  Triage\n\nnote states that she is complaining of substernal chest pain\n\nradiating to the neck with this and diaphoresis.  She is cool and\n\npale.  Her triage vital signs showed pulse of 148, up to 180s. \n\nShe was tachypneic.  Her blood pressure was unobtainable and her\n\nsats were 90% on room air.  She is hypoxic.  She was afebrile,\n\ntemperature 96.  She was immediately brought back to room.  At\n\nthat time, she complained of palpitations, diaphoresis, and chest\n\npain since 10 p.m.  She has had no history of an MI.\n\nPAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  She does have history of hypertension,\n\ndiabetes, and hypercholesterolemia.\n\nSOCIAL HISTORY:  She denies any tobacco or IV drugs or any other\n\ndrugs.  She lives with her family who is at her bedside.\n\nPAST SURGICAL HISTORY:  She has had bilateral tubal ligation.\n\nREVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  Currently, chest pain, palpitations,\n\ndiaphoresis, and shortness of breath.  Otherwise, all systems are\n\nnegative.\n\nMEDICATIONS:  She is on metformin and Lipitor.\n\nALLERGIES:  She has no known drug allergies.\n\nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  She is awake, alert, in moderate distress.\n\n She is tachycardic to 180 in the monitor.  Her blood pressure is\n\nnot able to be obtained at this time.  Her saturations are 100%\n\non room air, normal interpretation.  She is alert, awake and\n\noriented, follows commands.  Her head is atraumatic.  Her pharynx\n\nis normal.  Her neck is supple and nontender.  She is in no\n\nrespiratory distress with normal breath sounds.  Her heart is\n\ntachycardic with a narrow complex tachycardia on monitor.  Her\n\nabdomen is soft and nontender.  Her skin is intact but\n\ndiaphoretic.  Extremities are without pedal edema.  She is\n\noriented x3 with no cranial nerve and no motor or sensory\n\ndeficits.\n\nEMERGENCY DEPARTMENT COURSE:  She was placed on a monitor, EKG\n\nand received oxygen as well with this.  She was explained that\n\nshe was going to receive adenosine 6 mg and this did break her\n\noff from her SVT.  I was present during this time.  She had an\n\nEKG that then transformed to normal sinus rhythm at 91 with an\n\nincomplete right bundle-branch block with no previous to compare.\n\n She received aspirin, Lopressor, and nitroglycerin and remained\n\nhemodynamically stable throughout her ED stay.  For her\n\ntachycardia and chest pain, we ruled out AFib, complex\n\ntachycardia, pulmonary embolism, and acute coronary syndrome. \n\nShe was admitted for telemetry as well as a cardiac rule out. \n\nHer white count was 12 and her hematocrit was 42.  BUN 29 and\n\ncreatinine 1.2.  The d-dimer was negative.  Troponin was\n\nnegative.  Her chest x-ray was negative.\n\n ******** Not reviewed by Attending Physician ********\n\n1.  SVT.\n\n2.

About that time she was prescribed Amoxicillin and Metronidazole, presumably for H. pylori eradication (not confirmed); she reports an adverse reaction to amoxicillin with rash and facial swelling. The meds were discontinued and she started a course of oral methylprednisolone. She stopped this several weeks ago because it made her jittery. Approximately the same time she began to notice that food and pills would feel stuck in the throat; on further questioning, she also may have noted the presence of white spots in the mouth around this time as well. No fevers, chills, night sweats, nausea, vomiting, chest pain, palpitations, headache, lightheadedness, vertigo, rash or new joint pain; no recent travel. She does note that her blood sugars at home have been consistently elevated to the 200-300 range.\n\nIn the ED, Ms. Fay was afebrile and hemodynamically stable. She was evaluated by the GI department. A screening HIV test was negative. She was found to have mild hyponatremia and mild hyperkalemia, as well as a question of subtle ECG changes. The above findings prompted admission for further workup.\n\nROS: Pertinent positives and negatives above.\n\nPMH/PSH:   \nDiabetes mellitus\nHypertension\nHyperlipidemia\nObesity\nGERD\nOsteoarthritis and low back pain\nH/o AVNRT (2094)\n\nALLERGIES: Reported rash and facial swelling with Amoxicillin\n\nMEDICATIONS: \nAtenolol 50mg daily\nDiclofenac 75 mg Q8 prn\nMetformin 500mg PO BID\nPantoprazole 40 mg daily\nLoratadine\nAlbuterol MDI\nMeclizine 25mg PRN\nAledronate 70mg weekly\n\nFAMILY HISTORY: Noncontributory\n\nSOCIAL HISTORY:  Lives alone; family heavily involved in her care and assist with secondary ADLs. No alcohol, tobacco or drug use. Born in Peru, last visit about one year ago.\n\nPHYSICAL EXAM:\t\nGen: Alert, NAD\nVS:  Afebrile   82   100/54   18   100% RA\nHEENT:  Conjunctivae clear, anicteric, NP clear, OP with mild thrush, upper dentures; no sinus tenderness\nNeck:  Supple, no adenopathy; no palpable thyromegaly\nHeart: RRR, s1s2 without murmur\nLungs: CTA bilaterally without wheeze/rales\nABD: Soft, nontender, nondistended, nabs, no mass\nEXT:  Warm, no edema\nSkin: No rash or petechiae\nNeuro: A&Ox3, no focal deficits\n       \nLABORATORY:\n15.6 > 42.3 < 487   (77 poly, 17 lymph)\n130 / 5.3 / 99 / 21 / 38 / 1.1 < 375   eGFR 48\nALT/AST normal\nCK/MG/Troponin normal x 2 sets\nUA: 3+ glucose, otherwise negative\n\nMICROBIOLOGY: Urine culture pending\n\nRADIOLOGY: None\n\nECG: NSR, incomplete RBBB; T wave flattening/inversion in V2-V3 that was not noted on 2094 ECG\n\nIMPRESSION and PLAN: 66 year-old woman with solid/liquid dysphagia, oral candidiasis, and poorly controlled diabetes mellitus. The presence of thrush raises suspicion for esophageal candidiasis, though she does not report odynophagia. Mechanical obstruction should be ruled out. The presence of mild hyponatremia and hyperkalemia is likely attributable to the fact that she abruptly discontinued exogenous corticosteroids after a several week course; she is hemodynamically stable. Finally, there is little here to suggest acute coronary syndrome, though she falls into a subgroup of patients more likely to present with minimal symptoms. ECG warrants following. Diabetes is poorly controlled and may require initiation of insulin therapy; though sugars here may have been confounded by the dose of steroids given in ED.\n\nCV: CR monitor overnight; cycle ECG and cardiac biomarkers; aspirin, continue beta blocker\nPulm: No issues; albuterol prn\nGI: Upper endoscopy tentatively planned for the morning; NPO after midnight; continue home ppi\nEndocrine: Sliding scale insulin, metformin; consider diabetes education, and discuss with PCP whether initiation of insulin is warranted. Check HbA1c, TFTs\nFEN: Monitor lytes; lowfat ADA diet\nInfectious Disease: Following EGD, fluconazole for candidiasis; leukocytosis is unexplained, but not focal evidence of infection\nPPx: Enoxaparin may be started after EGD\nSocial work consult to assess support network and assist with discharge planning\n\nTerry Iyer will assume care in the morning.

The pt says the dizziness was worsened when he stood up to walk around; noting that it was particularly bad when he was standing and concentrating on a particular task such as shaving. The dizziness was alleviated by him lying down. He added that he began feeling dizzy during the storm last week when his drinking water was contaminated.  He drank tap water until he was told it was undrinkable, then he stopped. He later developed diarrhea while not drinking any water and only having occasional Coca-cola beverages. During these 2 weeks of dizziness, Mr. Ishida notes he felt that he lost 3-4 days of his life, saying that he was either knocked out or unconscious. He came to this conclusion b/c his medication box was still full for the previous 3 days; supporting his reflection by saying he rarely ever misses his medication. Mr. Ishida states that the room was not spinning and said that his dizziness was more like &#8220;lightheadness.&#8221; He feels that his problems began when taking Tylenol- 2 weeks ago and cannot identify any other medication that is associated with his symptoms. Mr. Ishida says he&#8217;s never experienced any dizziness before, and hoped his symptoms would subside if he just stayed in bed.

Mr. Ishida is most likely currently in a volume depleted stated. He had diarrhea induced by the contaminated water from the storm and only maintained his hydration with a meager 2 or 3 bottles of Coca-cola over several days. This in combination with his output of fluid from diarrhea, his diuretic medication, and possible osmotic diuresis (increased serum glucose level from soda intake in a diabetic) could have shifted him into hypovolemia. Thus Mr. Ishida might have decrease effective arterial volume causing his BUN/Cr ratio to be elevated, indicating a prerenal process. Although BUN/Cr ratio is not &gt;20, we can still assume that he has prerenal ARF considering his use of diuretics and h/o CKD which can decrease the sensitivity of BUN/Cr rations and FENa for assessing etiologies of renal failure. Mr. Ishida additionally uses NSAIDs (e.g. Naproxen), an ARB and an ACEI, all of which are associated with decreased intraglomerular pressure and renal vasoconstriction which can lead to prerenal ARF.\n\nIntrinsic ARF is less likely considering he is not using any overtly nephrotoxic drugs (e.g. amphotericin, cisplatin, or aminoglycosides. Conversely, he is at an increased risk of cholesterol emboli given his h/o of hypercholesterolemia and vasculopathy.\n\n      Lastly, Mr. Ishida my have a postrenal ARF etiology considering his h/o BPH which could lead to obstruction of the outflow tract leading to increased pressures in the ureters flowing back up into the kidneys.\n\n      Mr. Ishida&#8217;s dizziness and altered mental status are both explained by ARF. Additional explanations of altered mental status are ruled out via the history and physical including intoxication, brain hemorrhagic, brain tumor, etc.\n\nPLAN\n\n#) Acture Renal Failure\n\n-Continue fluids and hydration: 1L of IV saline over the next 24 hrs\n\n-D/c naproxen use.\n\n-Rule out Post-renal etiology: use ultrasound to assess the size of the bladder and ureters. If enlarged bladder and ureters are found the diagnosis is more likely postrenal ARF due to an enlarged prostate. Thus the patient should be assessed by Urology of possible partial prostatectomy.\n\n\n\n#) DM\n\n-Discontinue metformin due to possibility of metabolic acidosis and hospital drug interactions.\n\n#) CAD\n\n      -Switch Atenlol to metoprolol given ARF\n\n#) HTN\n\n-Discontinue lisinopril, valsartan, furosemide until pt&#8217;s renal condition improves.\n\n#) Gout\n\n      -D/C allopurinol until pt&#8217;s renal condition improves\n\n#)Hypercholesterolemia\n\n-Continue simvastatin as previously prescribed (Simvastatin  20 MG PO QHS)\n\n#) Psoriasis\n\n-Continue Ammonium Lactate 12% Cream and Calcipotriene 0.005%   TOP BID prn\n\n#)Benign Prostate Hypertrophy\n\n      -Continue Finasteride and darifenacin as previously prescribed.\n\n_________________________\n\nWilliam Yates, MSIII\n\nPager #66612"}

The paramedics and police were called the scene. \nThe police were able to force open the door of the home.  The \npatient was found unconscious on the floor, having a generalized \ntonic clonic seizure.  The patient was intubated and given 4 mg of \nAtivan prior to arrival in the Emergency Department with the \nparamedics.  On arrival in the Emergency Department, the patient \nwas noted to be comatose, intubated, and clearly in acute distress. \nThe patient has a history of diabetes mellitus.  She has had a \nseizure in the past, apparently secondary to hypoglycemia.  She \nalso has a history of high blood pressure.  She is on diltiazem, \nlisinopril, and medications for hypercholesterolemia. \nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Her temperature is 100.6 degrees F., her \npulse 150, her respiratory rate 12, her blood pressure on arrival \n205/90, and her O2 saturation is 98%.  On physical examination, the \nHEENT examination reveals a normocephalic head with no evidence of \ntrauma on examination.  The pupils are equal and round, weakly \nreactive to light.  The pupils are 2 mm.  The fundi cannot be \nvisualized.  The neck is supple.  There are no step-offs noted. \nThe chest is clear to auscultation bilaterally.  The heart has \nnormal S1 and S2, no S3 or S4, and no murmur.  The abdomen is \nprotuberant, but soft and non-tender, without guarding, rebound, \nmasses, or organomegaly.  The extremities are grossly within normal \nlimits.  Grossly, there is no posturing; there are no Babinskis; \nthe reflexes are about 1+ bilaterally. \nLABORATORY EVALUATION:  The head CT is noted to be negative.  The \nEKG reveals ST elevations in III and possibly aVF.  The heart rate \nis approximately 130.  The chest x-ray shows proper tube placement. \nThe troponin I is 2.2, and is in the process of being repeated. \nThe glucose is 174, the BUN 57, the creatinine 5.8, the sodium 137, \nthe potassium 5.3, the chloride 101, the CO2 18.  The CK is noted \nto be 920, and the CK-MB is 2.6%.  The toxicology screen is \nnegative.  The troponin I again is 2.2.  The urine toxicology is \nalso noted to be negative.  The white count is 14, the hemoglobin \n11, the hematocrit 36, and the platelet count 350.  The urinalysis \nshows 3+ blood.  There are only 1-3 WBCs in the urine. \nTHERAPY RENDERED/COURSE IN ED:   The plan is to admit the patient \nto the Intensive Care Unit for further work-up and evaluation.  An \nLP will be done in the Emergency Department, and following the LP, \nthe patient will be sent to the Medical Intensive Care Unit. \nFINAL DIAGNOSIS:  The diagnostic impression in the Emergency \nDepartment is seizure and coma of undetermined etiology. \nDISPOSITION (including condition on discharge):  The patient will \nbe admitted to the Medical Intensive Care Unit following her lumbar \npuncture. \n___________________________________                    HB768/1408 \nH.

The patient\n\nwas interviewed and examined by me.  Resident's note was reviewed\n\nand confirmed.  Plan of care was discussed.  Please see\n\nresident's note for details.\n\nHISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Briefly, this is a 74-year-old woman\n\nwith history of insulin-dependent diabetes and end-stage renal\n\ndisease who presented to Emergency Department after an episode of\n\nconfusion associated with a blood sugar in the field to 67 (per\n\nEMS) and responsive to orange juice with normal mental status\n\nupon arrival in the ED.  On further history, it seems that the\n\npatient took her usual dose of insulin this morning and ate\n\nbreakfast but missed lunch and dinner because of a flood in the\n\nbasement that had preoccupied her.  She has had prior episodes of\n\nhypoglycemia associated with skipping meals.  Otherwise, she has\n\nbeen feeling well.  No recent change in medications.\n\nPAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Diabetes, hypertension, asthma, CVA/TIA,\n\nand end-stage renal disease (predialysis).\n\nMEDICATIONS:  Insulin, diltiazem, Nephrocaps, methyldopa,\n\nFlovent, and Pravachol.\n\nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Awake, alert, sitting up in bed, and\n\neating supper.  No acute distress.  Temperature 97.2, pulse is\n\n81, respirations 16, blood pressure 170/82, and pulse oximetry\n\n100% on room air.  Cardiovascular exam:  Regular rate and rhythm.\n\n Lungs are clear.  Abdomen is soft and nontender.  Skin is warm\n\nand well perfused.  Neurologic:  Alert and oriented x3 and\n\nnonfocal.\n\nLABORATORY DATA:  EKG:  Without ischemia.  White count 9.4, blood\n\nglucose 93, creatinine 8.5, sodium 140, and potassium 4.9.\n\nCLINICAL IMPRESSION:  Hypoglycemia in setting of renal failure\n\n ******** Not reviewed by Attending Physician ********\n\nPLAN:  To lower NPH dose from 30 to 25 units.

Patient was evauated by Ortho who wanted to pursue a trial of non-operative management with bracing\n\n as patient was a poor surgical candidate.  \n\n\nThe patient was seen one day PTA in the ED for hypotension at HD. Appearantly on the trasfer to BH the patient fainted in the ambulance. The patient denied all complaints and had a normal head CT and EKG and was discharged home.  \n\n\nPatient was at YGH today and per nursing notes, the patient was not responsive verbally, wuith BP 136/58, BS 105, O2 100% on RA during this period.  However,  nursing reports some epidoses of apnea, clinically resolving after 15 minutes, during this episode, afterwhich the patient perked up on her own. Per LMR patient is only intermittenly verbal and severely demented at baseline.  Incontinent at baseline, no acute incontinence, no jerking or shaking.\n\n\nOf note, patient is cared for by daughter and numerous ancillary serivces. The patient's family has refused SNF placement in the past. Patient makes only occasional urine at baseline.\n\n\nDaughter reports patient has been eating fine at home, but is worried about these two episodes of \"unresponsiveness\". Patient is scheduled for fistulogram tomorrow and patient is supposed to be NPO after midnight for this procedure.\n\n\nED Course: Patient is being admitted for observation.

She has been to the emergency room\nmultiple times for purulent drainage around her groin.  She has\nbeen given multiple courses of antibiotics including Keflex and\ndicloxacillin.  She is planning to have her disease surgically\nmanaged in the next few months.  She most recently presented to\nthe emergency room on January 7, 2079 with swelling and drainage\nof her hydradenitis in her groin.  She was given a prescription\nof Keflex.  Shortly after taking the first tablet, she developed\nitching in the hands, face, and legs and as well as hives.  She\ndenied any shortness of breath, difficulty breathing or loss of\nconsciousness.  She called the emergency room and was instructed\nto stop taking Keflex as this was most likely an allergic\nreaction.  So now, she is here for follow up from that.  She said\nshortly after stopping antibiotic her symptoms of hives and\nitchiness have improved very quickly.  She is still complaining\nof purulent drainage around her groin.\n\nPAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Diabetes.\n\nMEDICATIONS:  Glucotrol, Percocet as needed for pain.\n\nALLERGIES:  She is allergic to erythromycin and now Keflex.  She\ngets hives from both.\n\nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Her left axilla looks dry.  Her bilateral\ngroins looks red, swollen tender with some serous as well as some\npurulent drainage.  There is no fluctuance that I could feel.\n\nASSESSMENT AND PLAN:  Worsening of her hydradenitis.  Given the\nrecent allergy to Keflex, we will obviously need to take a\ndifferent antibiotic.  She has been on dicloxacillin in the past\nwith good result.  Despite the 15% cross allergy of dicloxacillin\ncompared to Keflex, I think dicloxacillin is a good choice for\nnow.  If this does not work, I think one should consider\nclindamycin for treatment.  I will go ahead and give her 14 days\nworth of dicloxacillin and I instructing her to notify M.D. if\nshe develops any allergic reaction to this medicine.  I also gave\nher 60 tablets of Percocet as well as renewed her renewed her\nprescription of Glucotrol XL 2.5 mg a day.  She should see her\nPCP in two weeks.\n\n\n\n\n\n______________________________\nByron Pham, M.D.\n\n\nDictated By: Byron Pham\n\n\neScription document:9-3042267 EMSSten Tel\n\n\n\nDD: 01/14/79\nDT: 01/15/79\nDV: 01/14/79\nRecord date: 2080-03-24\n\n PICH CLINIC VISIT\n\nPT: Nora Greenwood\n\nDate of Visit: 3/24/80\n\nContact information: 715-007-3511\n\nId/cc: 48F with PMH of type II DM, hyperlipidemia, obesity, hidradenitis suppurativa, and new diagnosis of fibromyalgia presenting to PICH for follow-up visit re: 1) DM; 2) HTN; 3) hidradenitis suppurativa 4) fibromyalgia/joint pain.\n\nHPI: Interval hx to be reviewed by each issue.  \n\n1) DM: Most recent HgbA1c on 12/31/79: 7.1 (down from 8.2). Nora reports fasting BS in the 140-150 and pre-dinner BS ~low l00's, but does not always check her FS on a regular basis. Noticed that her FS were running much high (>200) when she was taking the elavil for her fibromyalgia. She stopped the elavil bc of these elevated FS. Continues to take Glucotrol XL 2.5mg qd. Denies any episodes of hypoglycemia, but aware of possible symptoms and knows to keep candy with her at all times. Saw nutrition on 6/5/79 and feels that her diet has improved since this session. Continues to be quite active, walking a lot at her job (RN) and at home. \n\n2) HTN: Continues to take lisinopril 20mg qd; BP slightly elevated at last visit at 144/68. Plan to repeat BP check today and if still elevated to increase lisinopril. Denies chest pain, SOB, DOE, LE edema, pnd, orthopnea, recent visual changes, palpitations, or headaches. Has been shoveling snow on a regular basis without sob or chest pain. \n\n3) hidradenitis suppurativa: Nora recently completed 14day course of levaquin for a flare of her hs. In past, treated with diclox and augmentin; however, nora felt that both became less effective with time. Also treated with Bactrim which was d/c'd 2/2 stomach upset. Feels that acute inflammation is better, but still with baseline, fairly severe inflammation, discharge, and pain. Had been seen by general surgery in the past who felt that she needed to be seen by plastics. Was scheduled to see plastics in consultation, but was told that she had to pay 200.00 for visit even though she was free care and could not afford this. Continues to use clindamycin topical gel. Denies fever, chills, night sweats, or n/v. \n\n4) FIBROMYALGIA/JOINT PAINS: Nora was recently seen in urgent care on 2/13/80 with c/o diffuse joint pains and myalgias x 2 weeks. Urgent care w/u included a negative ana, RF, and normal parvovirus IGM level, but IgG was 7.79% (normal less than 1.1). Seen by Dr. Marshall in Rheum who did not feel that she had a \"bona fide synovitis\" but considered ddx including fibromyalgia and inflammatory arthritis. Further work-up included a negative anti-ccp, normal EST, and a negative ASLO. He started her on elavil to improve her sleep, but nora stopped 2/2 elevated bs. Does feel that improved sleep significantly improves her symptoms. \n\nProblems\n\nType 2 diabetes \n\nHyperlipidemia \n\nh/o childhood asthma \n\nH/O pyelonephritis \n\nFH ovarian cancer : mother, grandmother, and sister\n\nsmoker \n\nHypertension \n\nObesity \n\nMedications\n\nGluctrol XL 2.5 MG PO QD , Take 1 tablet a day \n\nMiconazole CREAM 2% TOPICAL (MICONAZOLE NITRATE 2%) 1 APPLICATION (2% CREAM(GM) ) TOP TID \n\nNystatin POWDER TOPICAL TOP BID x 21 days, please apply twice a day to affected areas\n\nClindamycin 1% GEL TOPICAL TOP BID x 21 days, please apply to affected areas twice a day \n\nPercocet (OXYCODONE+APAP) 1 TAB (5-325MG TABLET ) PO Q4H PRN pain x 30 days, do not drive ot operate heavy machinery while on med as can make you drowsy \n\nLisinopril 20 MG (40MG TABLET take 1) PO QD x 30 days\n\nZocor (SIMVASTATIN) 20 MG (40MG TABLET take 1) PO QHS x 30 days, if you develop muscle pain or weakness, stop the drug immediately and call your doctor.\n\n\n\nAllergies\n\nErythromycins - Hives, \n\n\n\nPE: 218lbs 140/80 80 12 \n\nGENERAL: overweight female; appears relatively comfortable at rest, but uncomfortable getting on examining table \n\nHEENT: anicteric, EOMI, PERRL, mmm, thyroid nonpalable\n\nCHEST: CTA-B with good air movement\n\nCOR: rrr, S1S2, no m/r/g \n\nABD: obese, soft, NTND, +BS,\n\nEXT: no edema\n\nDERM: L>>R groin with significant scar tissue and swelling with overlying erythema, decreased drainage compared to last visit, although still significant tenderness to light touch; Left axilla with decreased erythema and drainage, although still w significant scar tissue, swelling, and mild drainage. \n\nA/P: 48F with PMH of type II DM, hyperlipidemia, hidradenitis suppurativa, and new diagnosis of fibromyalgia; a/p to be discussed by each specific issue: \n\n1) DM: Fairly well-controlled type II DM with HgbA1c of 7.1; will continue to aim for <7. \n\n----re-checking HgbA1c today; consider increasing Glucotrol XL from 2.5 to 5mg pnd result, goal <7%.\n\n----continue ASA 81mg qd\n\n----Encouraged continued weight loss; asked Nora to keep food/calorie log to review at next visit \n\n----Re-checking u/a, urine microalb/crt today; ordered last visit, but no results listed.\n\n----Increasing lisinopril from 20mg to 40mg for DM BP goal of <130/80\n\n----Confirm results of optho exam at next visit\n\n----perform DM foot exam at next visit (today denies numbness, paresthesias, or loss of sensation); discussed importance of good foot care and cautious nail clipping\n\n----Given elevated CRP (9.0) and LDL just at goal (96), will increase Zocor from 20mg to 40mg qhs \n\n2) HTN: still w BP above DM goal of <130/80 (140/80)\n\n----Increased lisinopril to 40mg qd\n\n----re-checking chem.7 in 7-10d with lisinopril dose increase\n\n3) hidradenitis suppurativa:\n\n----Will re-contact gen surgery re: their advice (attempt to locate note from visit)\n\n----will also contact plastics to discuss coverage for a procedure that is clearly not cosmetic\n\n----concerned about possible resistance to different abx, but need to treat until more definitive surgical treatment; (wrote script for levo for recurrent inflammation; told Nora that she had to call me to let me know if she needs to use it, but concerned bc last time she was unable to get to PICH until inflammation quite severe) \n\n4) family history of ovarian cancer: strong family history of ovarian cancer (sister, mother, and maternal GM all died from ovarian cancer); previously scheduled to see Dr. Crowley at MTCI on 2/12/80, but pt never received appt letter bc address changed. \n\n----re-scheduled appt with high risk ovarian cancer clinic at the MTCI\n\n5) tobacco cessation: stressed the importance of tobacco cessation to Nora for her heart, cancer risk, pulmonary health, and overall health.

Nora saw Dr. Iyer on 3/02/81 who felt that given the broad extent of the left axillary involvement, she would require extensive debridement and excision, and likely flap rotation coverage.

I have been \nreadjusting Mr. Geiger's blood pressure regimen since he left Hale Memorial Hospital for an episode of gastroenteritis and hypovolemia \nseveral months ago.  His blood pressure regimen currently is HCTZ 25mg \nq.d., lisinopril, 20mg q.d. and atenolol 25mg q.d.  He apparently went \nto an office visit at Dr. Mueller office a week ago and was noted there \nto have high blood pressure.  She prescribed an increase in his atenolol \nfrom 25mg to 50mg.  He has not yet completed that prescription.  Mr. \nGeiger's blood pressure today is 180/80.  He denies any recent chest \npain, shortness of breath, lightheadedness or other symptoms.  \n\nMr. Geiger's cholesterol was checked by me last visit due to a modestly \nelevated cholesterol one year ago which had not been treated.  His \ncurrent cholesterol level was total 283, HDL 54, LDL 196.  \n\nREVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  Mr. Geiger denies any recent fever, chills, \nheadache, chest pain, shortness of breath, cough, nausea, vomiting, \ndiarrhea, dysuria.  \n\nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  His blood pressure is 180/80.  His weight is 184.  \nHis heart rate is 80.  Lung exam is clear to auscultation bilaterally.  \nThe cardiac exam shows a regular rate and rhythm with normal S1, S2, no \nmurmurs.  Abdominal exam is benign.  Extremities show no evidence of \nedema.  \n\nRecent laboratories show a chem 7 panel of sodium 141, potassium 4.5, \nchloride 101, bicarb 29, BUN 11, creatinine 1.1, glucose 124.  He has a \nnormal liver function test and normal calcium and magnesium.  His T4 is \nnormal at 10.3.  His THBR is normal at 0.98.  \n\nASSESSMENT AND PLAN:  \n1.   Hypertension.  Mr. Geiger's blood pressure continues to be elevated \n     despite his current regimen of HCTZ and lisinopril and atenolol.  \n     He was recently given an increased atenolol dose from Dr. Mueller.  \n     I agree with this decision and will wait for him to fill his \n     prescription and begin this new regimen before he follows up in a \n     few weeks for blood pressure check.  \n2.   Cholesterol.  The patient's cholesterol is significantly elevated.  \n     Given his comorbidities, I would aim for an LDL level less than \n     130.  Thus, I will begin a course of atorvastatin.  His current \n     liver function tests are normal.\n\nHALE MEMORIAL HOSPITAL\nInternal Medicine\n35 Dearborn Street                             Geiger, Xian\nRayne, MI  82978                             01729440\n                                              01-14-77 \nPage 2\n\n\n3.   Health maintenance.  I have recommended to him losing some weight.  \n     He has gained 6 pounds since his visits last month.  He attributes \n     this to his holiday eating, but he says that he gets a good deal of \n     exercise.  I will continue to recommend diet and exercise for him.  \n     He has most recently competed a Pneumovax and a flu vaccine last \n     week. \n\n\n\n_________________________\nNicholas Whaley, M.D.\n\nBS:HB1008; DD: 01-14-77; DT: 01-14-77; DV: 01-14-77\nRecord date: 2077-06-16\n\n\n\n\nHALE MEMORIAL HOSPITAL\nInternal Medicine\n600 Dearborn Street\nRayne, MI  82978\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tGeiger, Xander \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t01729440\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t06/16/77 \n\n\nMr. Geiger is a 75 year old man with a history of hypertension, \nhyperlipidemia and panhypopituitarism who comes in today for \nfollow up of his blood pressure.  We have been titrating up his \nblood pressure meds over the past week.  He is gone from 50mg of \natenolol to 75 to 100mg with steady improvement in his blood \npressure.  His current regimen is atenolol 100q.d., HCTZ 25 q.d., \nlisinopril 20mg q.d.  The patient has had no dizziness or other \nsymptoms with increasing doses of atenolol.\n\nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  His blood pressure is 160/94.  Heart rate \nis 64.  Carotids 2+ without bruits.  Lungs clear to auscultation \nbilaterally.  Cardiac exam: regular rate and rhythm, normal S1, \nS2 with no murmurs.  Abdomen is benign.  Extremities: no edema.  \n\nLaboratories:  Cholesterol from June 11, 2077: total 171, HDL 57, \nLDL 86. \n\nASSESSMENT AND PLAN:  Mr. Geiger is a very pleasant 75 year old \nman with hypertension, hyperlipidemia.\n1. \tHypertension.  Blood pressure still elevated.  I will increase \nlisinopril to 30mg q.d.  Will also check a set of electrolytes \nat his next visit in 2 weeks when his blood pressure will be \nfollowed up.\n2. \tCholesterol.  Well controlled at this time.\n3. \tHealth maintenance.  The patient denies any colonoscopy in the \npast.  I do not see one on record or in his history.  We will \narrange a screening colonoscopy.  The patient has had recent \nPSA of 2.8 and a normal prostate exam by me last year.  He is \ndue for annual physical next month and will schedule this. \n\n\n\nNathan Whaley, M.D.\n\nNW:burns:06-74086442.doc; DD: 6/16/77; DT: 6/17/77; DV: 6/16/77\nRecord date: 2079-03-13\n\n\nHMH\nnull                                      GEIGER, XANDER\nRayne, MI null                                      01729440\nnull                                           03/13/79\n\n\nHISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient has a known history of\nhypopituitarism and hypertension who comes in today for routine\nannual exam.  He states that he has been feeling exceptionally\nwell.  No history of chest pain, angina, dyspnea on exertion,\nshortness of breath, abdominal complaints.  No difficulties in\nbowel habits, melena, BRBPR.  No prostatic symptoms of urinary\nhesitancy or slow stream.  He states that he has been carefully\ntaking his prednisone and testosterone as prescribed, as well as\nhis blood pressure medicines including lisinopril 40 q.d.,\natenolol 75 q.d., and his cholesterol medicine 10 of Lipitor q.d.\n He is no longer taking the hydrochlorothiazide that was\nprescribed to him in the past.  He also states that he has run\nout of Synthroid and has not been taking that for the past\nseveral weeks.\n\nThe patient states that he is staying active, getting some\nexercise, continues to abstain from smoking or drinking, and has\nan appropriate diet.\n\nREVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  On full review of systems, he denies any\ncurrent concerns except for occasional difficulty maintaining an\nerection, which he states is not a significant problem for him.\n\nMEDICATIONS:  Lipitor 10 q.d., testosterone q.3. weeks,\nprednisone 5 mg q.a.m. 2.5 mg q.p.m., lisinopril 40 mg q.d., and \natenolol 75 mg q.d.\n\nPAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Panhypopituitarism secondary to\nmacroadenoma resection and hypertension.\n\nHEALTH MAINTENANCE:  Last cholesterol level 06/2077, total 171\nwith an HDL of 57 and LDL of 86.  The patient has not had a prior\ncolonoscopy.  Last PSA was less than assay 1 year ago.\n\nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Well appearing, in no acute distress. \nBlood pressure elevated at 170/84, heart rate 60.  HEENT:  Pupils\nequal, round, reactive to light.  Extraocular movements are\nintact.  Fundi are benign.  Oropharynx is clear.  Tympanic\nmembranes are clear.  Neck:  Shows no lymphadenopathy, no\nthyromegaly.  He does have a 3 x 3 cm cyst on his posterior neck\nthat seems to be a lipoma.  JVP is flat.  Carotids are 2+ without\nbruits.  Lungs:  Clear to auscultation bilaterally.  Cardiac: \nRegular rate and rhythm, S1, S2 normal, positive S4, 1/6 systolic\nmurmur at the apex.  Abdomen:  Midline scar status post some type\nof cord resection.  Positive bowel sounds, soft, nontender,\nnondistended, no hepatosplenomegaly.  Aorta is nonpalpable. \nThere are no renal bruits.  Femoral arteries are without bruits. \nGU:  Testicles appear normal.  Penis appears normal.  Rectal: \nGuaiac negative brown stool.  Prostate is smooth and nonenlarged.\n Extremities:  No clubbing, cyanosis or edema.  Normal sensation\nto vibratory in the feet.\n\nASSESSMENT AND PLAN:  The patient is a very pleasant 77-year-old\nman who is overall doing extremely well except for his\nhypertension which is poorly controlled.  I am unclear as to why\nhe stopped his hydrochlorothiazide, but I think that this should\nbe restarted as we do not have any further room with his\nlisinopril or atenolol.  He will begin at 25 mg q.d.  I will have\nhis electrolytes checked today and come back and see me in 2\nweeks' time for a repeat electrolyte check as well as blood\npressure check, and further medication adjustment if necessary. \nWe will also check urinalysis for protein as well as an EKG at\nthis time given his hypertension.\n\nHyperlipidemia, on Lipitor.  We will recheck cholesterol today.\n\nPanhypopituitarism.  He seems to be doing well on his medications\nexcept that he stopped his TSH dose for unclear reasons.  I have\ninstructed him to restart his Synthroid and given him new\nprescriptions.  We will recheck thyroid panel at this time.\n\nHealth maintenance.  We will check a PSA and schedule a\ncolonoscopy today.\n\nHe will return to clinic in 2 weeks' time for a BP check.\n\n\n______________________________\nNATHAN WHALEY, M.D.\n\neScription document:6-3377872\n\nDD: 03/13/79\nDT: 03/14/79\nDV: 03/13/79\n\n========================== Preceptor's Note ==========================\n\n\n\n\n\n========================== Preceptor's Note ==========================\n\n\n\n77 yo man here for fu pmhx of htn, panhypopit . no complaints today. he is taking all his meds except for his hctz. bp is high today. p of 60. plan to resume his hctz, check chol, tsh, psa, colonscopy. pt seen, discussed with resident, plan as above."}

He reports that at this time, he has some mild shortness of breath with the onset of the pain, although this was resolved by the time he was seen in the ED.  He did not complain of any chest pain, palpitations or dipahoresis at that time, although he did have some nausea and vomited once in the ED.  Patient is well known to the ED from prior admissions, and at that time his pain was felt to be 2/2 to throacic radiculopathy/neuropathy 2/2 to his diabetes, however acuity of pain, CT abdomen was performed at that time, which did not reveal any acute patholgy to explain his pain.  He was discharged to home at that time with oral pain medication.  Patient reports that pain did not improve, and was not well controlled with oral pain mediations at home, so he re- presented to the ED.  He does not report any fevers or chills, shortness of breath, cough, back pain, or LE swelling.  Patient is anuric and has been attending dialysis per his usual MWF routine.  \n\n\nOn presentation to the ED, patient was afebrile, BP 180s/90s, HR 70s, satting 100% on RA.  He was given IV morphine for his pain, and IV benedryl for nausea (he has had a cyclic vomiting/nausea syndrome on prior admission which has been effectively treated this way).  Patient reported at that time that he had not had a bowel movement in 3 days, and that he normally has one every other day.  Rectal exam did not reveal any stool in the vault, and CT scan from the day prior did not show excessive stool or evidence of obstruction or fecal impaction.  However, patient was given dulcolax PR.  He was admitted to medicine for further evaluation and pain control.  \n\n \n\nPMH:  \n\n\nIDDM, diagnosed 20 years ago, complicated by retinopathy 5 years ago, nephropathy 5 years ago, and bilateral TMA 8 years ago\n \nESRD on HD, started HD 5 years ago, on MWF schedule at Cochran Memorial Hospital\n\nBilateral blindness for 5 years 2/2 diabetic retinopathy\n\nHypertension\n\nHyperlipidemia\n\nDepressionGERD/Gastritis\n\nS/p bilateral TMA 8 years ago, complicated by osteomyelitis of right foot in 2065 and 2068\n\n\n\n\nS/p cholecystectomy\n\n\n\nAllergies: \n\nNKDA\n\n\n\nHome medications: \n\nAcetylsalicylic Acid 81 MG (81 MG TABLET Take 1) PO QD #100 Tablet(s)\nAmlodipine 10 MG (10 MG TABLET Take 1) PO QD x 30 days #30 Tablet(s)\nCinacalcet 30 MG PO QHS #30 Tablet(s)\nClonidine 0.2 MG PO BID\nCymbalta (DULOXETINE) 20 MG (20MG CAPSULE DR Take 1) PO BID #60 Capsule(s)\nDiphenhydramine Oral 25 MG PO 3x/Week M-W-F PRN Itching, originally prescribed MWF with dialysis, has been taking TID with meals \nDocusate Sodium 100 MG PO BID #100 Capsule(s)\nEpoetin Alfa (NON-ONCOLOGY) 6000 UNITS IVPUSH x1\nHecterol 6 MCG IV with dialysis, With Dialysis Monday, Wednesday and Friday #1 Month(s) Supply\nHecterol 6 MG 3x/Week M-W-F, GIve with HD \nInsulin Lispro Mix 75/25 12 UNITS SC QPM #1 Month(s) Supply\nInsulin Lispro Mix 75/25 25 UNITS SC QAM #1 Month(s) Supply\nInsulin Syringes ONE PO bid #1 Month(s) Supply\nKexalate 15 GM PO bid, On non dialysis days - En los dias que no se hace dialisis #1 Month(s) Supply\nLisinopril 40 MG PO QD, on non-dialysis days only \nMiralax (POLYETHYLENE Glycol ) 17 GM (17G POWD PACK ) PO QD PRN constipation, Each 17 GM dose to be dissolved in 8 oz of water x 15 days #15 doses\nNephro-vit Rx 1 TAB PO QD #90 Tablet(s)\nOmeprazole 20 MG (20 MG CAPSULE DR Take 1) PO QD #90 Capsule(s)\nReglan (METOCLOPRAMIDE Hcl) 5 MG (5 MG TABLET Take 1) PO AC PRN nausea, constipation x 30 days #90 Tablet(s)\nSennosides 17.2 MG PO BID PRN Constipation\nSevelamer 2400 MG (800MG TABLET Take 3) PO TID\nSimvastatin 20 MG (20MG TABLET Take 1) PO QHS #90 Tablet(s)\nToprol Xl (METOPROLOL Succinate Extended Release) 150 MG (100 MG TAB.SR 24H Take 1) PO QD, Take 1 pill of 100 mg and 1 pill 50 mg for total of 150 mg #60 TAB.SR\n\n\nFAMILY HISTORY:\n\n \n\nMother and grandmother with DM.\n\n\n\n\nSOCIAL HISTORY:\n \n(per note from previous admission 3/10/68)\n\nOriginally from Panama City.

She has no focal deficits.\n\n She had no fall, no fevers, no chest pain, no shortness of\n\nbreath, no abdominal pain, no nausea, no vomiting, and no\n\ndiarrhea.  She is able to ambulate with a walker.  She denies\n\nheadache.  She was feeling well until yesterday.  She had no\n\nrecent medication changes.  She has chronic lower extremity\n\nedema, left greater than right.  She has stable 2-pillow\n\northopnea.  She is followed by Dr. Whitman of Cardiology.  She\n\ntakes Lasix 80 mg twice daily among other medications and the\n\nstatus was stable.  She had a normal cardiac stress test\n\napproximately 4 months ago.\n\nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  She presents with a heart rate of 84,\n\nrespiratory rate of 16, blood pressure initially of 220/90,\n\nsystolic pressure decreased to 175 without treatment shortly\n\nafter arrival, and oxygen saturation of 99% on room air with\n\ntemperature of 98.5.  She is awake and alert.  She is in no acute\n\ndistress.  She has moist mucous membranes.  Her neck is supple\n\nwith full range of motion.  She has mild left-sided facial droop,\n\nwhich she states is old.  She has clear and equal breath sounds\n\nbilaterally and no respiratory distress.  Heart is regular\n\nwithout murmurs.  She has soft, nontender belly.  She has\n\nasymmetric lower extremity edema with 2-3+ pitting edema to the\n\nleft and 1+ pitting edema to the right, which she states is\n\nchronic and unchanged from baseline.  She has 5/5 strength\n\nthroughout.  She has no pronator drift.  She is able to ambulate\n\nwith a walker.\n\nLABORATORY DATA:  Basic laboratory testing shows an unremarkable\n\nCBC and Chem-7.  A set of cardiac marker shows a troponin of\n\n0.06, which is decreased from her most recent baseline, which has\n\nbeen elevated over the past several months.  Her BNP was 112. \n\nHer urinalysis was unremarkable.  Her EKG was a paced rhythm. \n\nChest x-ray was unremarkable.\n\nEMERGENCY DEPARTMENT COURSE:  The patient was discussed with Dr.\n\nWhitman who recommended the patient be admitted to the\n\nObservation Unit for another set of cardiac markers to ____\n\ntroponin as well as observation.  He will see the patient in the\n\nmorning.  If the patient's ____ set of cardiac markers are not\n\nincreasing and she feels well enough to go home, she will likely\n\nbe discharged after Dr. Whitman sees her and makes any\n\nmedication adjustments that are necessary.\n\nPRIMARY DIAGNOSIS:  Hypertension.\n\nSECONDARY DIAGNOSIS:  Generalized weakness.\n\nDISPOSITION:  Observation Unit.\n\n______________________________\n\nOAKLEY, ALBERT M.D.\n\nD: 11/02/97\n\nT: 11/02/97\n\nDictated By: OAKLEY, ALBERT\n\neScription document:1-98167165 BFFocus\n\n ******** Not reviewed by Attending Physician ********"}

This is rather a simple cellulitis, and may be treated with Ancef.  Consult wound care nurse to recommend appropriate dressings and care of wound.  Consider c/s surgery for unaboots.  No debridement necessary.  Send blood cx - monitor for bloodstream seeding.  Consider MRI of LE to r/o osteomyelitis, however, doubt such a shallow ulceration could cause it.\n\n2.\tChest pain with bigeminy and PVCs:  Rule out for MI by enzymes x3, as ?new dysrhythmia may signify ?myocardial irritation/damage.  Monitor EKG and telemetry.  If ruled out, consider inpt vs. outpt adenoside mibi.  Check lipid panel to further elucidate CAD risk, possibly start a statin.\n\n3.\tDeconditioning/SOB:  Consult PT/OT to assist with mobility and exercise tolerance.  \n\n4.\tProphylaxis:  Fragmin.

This occurred despite his efforts to lose weight and his active participation in a weight watchers weight reduction program. The weight gain was accompanied by abdominal distension and    bloating   , increased leg swelling and increasing SOB. He also reports severe DoE, with a maximal walking distance of 5-6 steps, as well as a deteriorating a scrotal edema with some dysuria, and rectal incontinence. Since the recent weight gain, he also developed an extensive itchy erythema in his groins.  He denies CP, diarrhea, HA, fever, chills, cough. His PCP prescribed metoclopramid and protonix for his abdominal complaints; however, the patient felt dizzy and dehydrated after taking these medications and decided to discontinue those. He also stopped taking his regular lasix medication about a week ago. Because of his increasing SOB, he called EMS, who found him cyanotic in his apartment with an Sa02 of 73% on RA. \n\nED Course: On arrival in the ED, his VS were: T98, BP108/65, RR24, HR100, O2Sa 92% on 4L 02. He received one dose of lasix 80mg iv, urine output unrecorded.

In the absence of CP, PE unlikely.  Cardiac enzymes negative. \nCHF: Currently treated with Verapamil for afterload reduction. Will consider to switch Verapamil to ACEI. Reinitiated Lasix. \nHTN: patient here normotensive. Currently taking verapamil, however, 1. degree heart block. Will consider switching to ACEI. \nOSA: Patient on home oxygen. Will suggest CPAP/BiPAP\nDiabetes: Currently taking Glybyride, will obtain HBA1c here, keep on RISS while inpatient.\nAbdominal discomfort/bloating: Most likely related to recent weight gain of 30 lbs, diabetic gastroparesis might also be contributing. Patient unable to tolerate metoclopramide. Discussed possibility of gastric bypass, patient rejects.\nRectal incontinence: Might be related to diabetic neuropathy. Patient also unable to perform anal hygiene because of obesity. \nGroin erythema: Suggestive of fungal infection.

The patient has had innumerable episodes of ulceration, which heal with TubiGrip and Profore dressings ultimately to break down again.  The patient has been discharged from the TNA and as I understand it the question is put to me today is whether the patient is a candidate for a Lymphapress.  The patient has had chronic bilateral lower extremity discoloration and swelling for over ten years.  He has never worn compression stockings.  He has had multiple episodes of recurrent ulcers.  To the best of his knowledge he has never had phlebitis but has had Unna boots in the past.  The patient denies any prolonged hospitalization, long bone fractures or prior history of DVT. \nThere is no family history of varicose veins or DVT.  He has no personal history of cancer or trauma.  He has not been involved in any prolonged travel, does not take any hormone medication and is unemployed.  \n\n\n\nThe patient's past medical history is notable for coronary artery disease, congestive heart failure, sleep apnea, peripheral neuropathy, morbid obesity, hypertension and pulmonary hypertension. \n\n\n\nHis current medications include lisinopril, verapamil, metformin, furosemide, aspirin, vitamin C, Spiriva and Advair.  \n\n\n\nThe patient denies any family history of cancer, thrombocytosis, thrombocytopenia or bleeding.  \n\n\n\nThe patient was raised in Dothan and lives in Galion.  He does not work, denies alcohol abuse and quit tobacco eight years ago.\n\n\n\nHis review of systems is notable for right upper quadrant pain, dyspnea, glasses, diabetes and hyperlipidemia.\n\n\n\nOn physical exam he is a morbidly obese gentleman with intertriginous rashes question fungal origin in the axilla on the right.  He has distant breath sounds with fine expiratory wheezes.  He has some tenderness in the right upper quadrant to palpation.  He has a huge protuberant abdomen.  There is no tenderness in the right upper quadrant.  He has bounding carotid, brachial and radial pulses.  His femoral pulses are not palpable likely due to his body habitus.  On the left his dorsalis pedis is 1+ and on the right his posterior tibial was 2+.  He has huge legs with evidence of stasis dermatitis and lipodermatosclerosis, which is greater on the left than the right.  He has prominent varices on his right thigh near the takeoff of what appears to be an anterolateral accessory branch.  He has severe brawny induration, discoloration and superficial ulcers on the right with none on the left.  The patient seems somewhat reserved but is quite communicative when prompted.\n\n\n\nThe results of his noninvasive vascular lab studies showed bilateral greater saphenous vein reflux.  The reflux is confined to the first accessory saphenous vein in the right leg and the saphenopopliteal junction in the proximal thigh.  It should be noted that the reflux in the saphenopopliteal junction on the right is 0, in the anterolateral saphenous vein on the right it is 3 seconds and in the small saphenous vein on the right the reflux is 3 seconds.  In the deep femoral vein, common femoral and superficial femoral vein there is no reflux.  In contrast on the left there is reflux at the saphenopopliteal junction of a mere 3 seconds, in the proximal greater saphenous vein 3 seconds, midthigh 3 seconds and distal thigh 3 seconds.  In the popliteal vein there is no reflux and the small saphenous vein there is 3 seconds.  Due to the patient's size it was difficult to identify perforators.  \n\n\n\nIn summary, we have a morbidly obese gentleman with mild to moderate reflux on examination and severe stasis dermatitis and discoloration.  Thus there is a mismatch between the degree of physical findings and objective laboratory data.  I believe that this is the case primarily because the patient cannot lie flat and often sleeps with his legs in a dependent position.  Thus he has an ongoing stasis in his legs due to inactivity and dependency.  This in addition to his morbid obesity, that is a girth of 385 pounds that presses on his abdomen 24 hours a day, seven days a week and compresses the vena cava as well as the lymphatic drainage of his legs.  All of these factors taken into account contribute to his discoloration, ulceration and lower extremity swelling.\n\n\n\nThe solution to this problem is not an easy one.  With his obstructive sleep apnea and abdominal girth the chances of him objectively putting his legs up so they are higher than his belly or heart are nonexistent.  Certainly it is not unreasonable to use a Lymphapress machine to help remove some of the swelling and edema that this patient experiences in his legs, however a Lymphapress is not a maintenance device but is an interventional device.  If we do not have a plan as to what to put on his legs after the Lymphapress is removed in between treatments it will be of no long-term benefit.  I would recommend that he use a Lymphapress machine and intermittent wraps with 6 to 8 inch ACE wraps.  I would always make the tension in the ACE wraps at the level of the ankle and heel greater than the midcalf.  I have given him a prescription for a Lymphapress machine as well as ACE wraps and discussed the relevant components of his care, which are important.  I hope that these interventions will help him with his lower extremity edema and swelling.  It is unlikely that any intervention at the level of his veins will overcome the terrible hydrostatic pressure of his abdomen and total body girth.  If I can provide any additional information regarding Mr. Uribe, please let me know.\n\n\n\nSincerely,\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMichael D.

Patient states his dry weight is ~380lbs.  He was recently in Amboy after surgery for nonhealing venous stasis ulcer and returned home in 9/24.  Upon returning home his weight was down to 342 lbs, however upon admission it is 409 lbs.  Patients reports the past 3 weeks he has felt abdominal bloating, increased LE edema and increase dyspnea on exertion.  At baseline he is able to ambulate short distances on his cane however now he is barely able to get up off the toilet. \nHe also reports increased drainage from his RLE wound.  He reports medication compliance except for missing 2-3 times over the past several weeks.  He reports increased fluid intake including Progresso soup, ice water, diet coke and a &#8216;dash&#8217; of salt to his food.  At baseline he requires 2L O2 during the day and 4L at night.  His CPAP machine has been broken for the past week.  He typically sleeps on 3 pillows but has recently increased to 4.  He awakes from sleep often feeling short of breath and sits on the edge of his bed to catch his breath.  Today he saw his PCP at Saint Mary's Hospital Fallbright Center for the above complaints and was sent immediately to the urgent care clinic.  From there he was transferred to the HBH ED.\n\n\n\nIn the ambulance he received 40 mg IV lasix x 1 and had 1L of UOP.  In the ED, VS were HR 106, BP 110/80  RR 20  O2 sat 96% on 5L.  He received another 40mg IV of lasix and put out 800 cc.  Labs revealed a K of 3.1, Mg of 1.4, Hct of 35.4 and BNP of 1625.  K and Mg were repleted.  Diltiazem 30mg po x 1 was given for rapid afib.  CXR showed stable interstitial edema.

He presents with a burn on the \n\nright side of the neck.  He presents to the emergency department \n\nwith a minor amount of redness on the right side of the neck and \n\nminor soft tissue swelling.  The trachea is midline.  The uvula is \n\nmidline.  There is no airway compromise.  There are no airway \n\ncomplaints.\n\nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  No voice change.  The airway is patent and \n\nintact.  The lungs are clear, with no wheezes.  The examination \n\nshows a first-degree burn of the right side of the neck, with no \n\nblistering and no breakage of the skin.\n\nTHERAPY RENDERED/COURSE IN ED:  The patient received a tetanus shot \n\nand was seen by the Burn Service.  He was dressed with Bacitracin \n\nand discharged home.  He was to follow up in 48 hours just for a \n\nrecheck.  The Burn Service essentially signed off on him, with no \n\nneed for follow-up, but given this was his neck and only \n\nfirst-degree, I asked him to return here for follow-up.\n\nFINAL DIAGNOSIS:  First-degree burn of the right side of the neck.\n\nDISPOSITION (including condition upon discharge):  He is discharged \n\nwith Bacitracin ointment and analgesics, and is to follow up in 48 \n\nhours.  The patient's condition on discharge is stable.  \n\n___________________________________                    RO904/06747 \n\nXAVIER ODONNELL, M.D.       XO71                           D:02/07/66 \n\n                                                       T:02/07/66 \n\nDictated by:  XAVIER ODONNELL, M.D.       XO71 \n\n ******** Not reviewed by Attending Physician ********\nRecord date: 2071-04-11\n\n            Burn Surgery Admission H&P \t\tDate/Time: 4/11/71, 9am\n****************************************************\nName: Rivers, Karsten   \nMRN# 95718084 \nResident: Gillis\nAttending: Michael \n****************************************************\nCC: burn to R foot\nHPI: \n44yo diabetic M with peripheral neuropathy, fell asleep in front of space heater approximately 3 weeks ago and noted swelling/blisters at tips of R 1st-3rd toes upon waking.

As you may know, he is a 47-year-old gentleman with a history of poorly controlled hypertension, poorly controlled insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus, former tobacco use, morbid obesity, no family history of early coronary disease and no known coronary disease.  He was presented to the Cardiovascular Clinic today for preoperative evaluation prior to an orthopedic surgery scheduled for later on this week by Dr. Phillip Isaac Crosby, at the Lamoni Nursing Rehabilitation Center.  This gentleman has a torn ligament in his right hip and is scheduled for laparoscopic repair at the Lamoni Nursing Rehabilitation.  Mr. Rivers, as mentioned, denies any history of known coronary artery disease.  He has had a prior stress test greater than 15 years ago, but none recently.  He denies any recent catheterization or echocardiogram.  He works currently as a floor coverer in Shelton and has done so for 20 years.  He is able to ambulate approximately two flights of steps, but at the top of the steps develops slight dyspnea on exertion, unclear whether or not this is related to a cardiac etiology or secondary to his morbid obesity with his weight over 400 pounds.  He denies any heart failure symptoms, orthopnea, PND, lower extremity edema or nocturia though he has been maintained on Lasix diuresis in the past though none currently.  Additionally, he has poorly controlled diabetes for which he is being followed in the Diabetes Clinic here at the KCM as well as poorly controlled hypertension for which he is on multiple agents.  He denies any history of exertional chest discomfort and as mentioned, he is still quite active despite his BLANK as an Interior Designs floor coverer.\n\nReview of systems is otherwise unremarkable.\n\nPast medical history is remarkable for hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, insulin dependent diabetes mellitus and morbid obesity.\n\nMedications include Toprol-XL 125 mg p.o. daily, aspirin 81 mg p.o. daily, Lipitor 20 mg p.o. daily, Neurontin 400 mg p.o. daily, insulin, Aldactone 25 mg p.o. daily, Avapro 300 mg p.o. daily and minoxidil 10 mg p.o. daily.\n\nHe is allergic to penicillin for which he develops a rash.\n\nHis social history is remarkable for former tobacco use for many years, though he quit more than three years ago.  He has no extensive alcohol or illicit drug use history.  He lives locally with his wife and five children and as mentioned is a floor coverer in ID working at Provo.  He is followed by Dr. Gilmore at the Helena Hospital for primary care.\n\nOn examination, he is afebrile, heart rate is 98 and regular, blood pressure 148/78 and respiratory rate is 16 breaths per minute in no acute distress.  He is a well-appearing gentleman in stated age with morbid obesity.  His jugular venous pressure is difficult to estimate given his habitus.  He is clear to auscultation bilaterally.  He has a regular rate and rhythm with a normal S1, S2 and no murmur, rub or gallop.  His abdomen is obese, nontender with positive bowel sounds and no hepatomegalies appreciated.  His extremities are warm and well perfused with trace edema at the ankles.  He has good distal pulsations.  His carotids are 2+ bilaterally without bruit.\n\nLaboratory values are not available today.\n\nECG reveals normal sinus rhythm with a heart rate of 99.  He has left anterior fascicular hemiblock with normal R wave progression through his precordium.  No evidence for LVH or prior infarction.  He does have low voltage in his limb leads, consistent with his morbid obesity.\n\nImpression:  Mr. Rivers is a very pleasant 47-year-old gentleman with multiple cardiac risk factors, notably insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus as well as poorly controlled hypertension with no known coronary artery disease now presenting for cardiovascular clearance prior to elective hip repair scheduled for three days from now.  This gentleman has no known coronary disease and has a reasonable exercise capacity, which I estimate to be 3 to 5 METS.  Most recently, given his hip and orthopedic issues, he has been unable to ambulate even to three METS.  However, prior to his orthopedic injury several months ago, he was able to ambulate up two flights of steps with only minimal dyspnea upon reaching the top step and without any exertional chest discomfort.  However, given his multiple risk factors, notably his poorly controlled diabetes and poorly controlled hypertension as well as former tobacco use, he certainly is at very high risk for obstructive coronary disease.  As such, I recommended we obtain a Persantine PET stress test for tomorrow morning.  If this test is normal without any high risk features or without any evidence for obstructive coronary disease, it would be reasonable for him to proceed with surgery later on this week.  This test will also suffice for his upcoming gastric laparoscopic bypass surgery, which is scheduled for 01/2074.  With regards to his medication, his blood pressure still is not at goal below 130.  As such, I have increased his Toprol-XL from 125 mg to 200 mg p.o. daily.  This medication should be continued through all surgery.  Additionally, if this is not sufficient in bringing his blood pressure down below 130, I would recommend the addition of a diuretic to his regimen either Lasix 20 mg p.o. daily or hydrochlorothiazide 25 mg p.o. daily.  Additionally, it will be essential that his diabetes be taken better control of and he is now working closely with the diabetes center here at the KCM to do so.  His last A1c was approximately 13 and this is certainly way out of range for someone of his young age.  I am hopeful with continued medical therapy this gentleman can continue to improve his life and undergo orthopedic surgery as well as gastric bypass surgery with significant improvement to his quality of life and future cardiac risk.  With regards to his hypertension, he is on multiple agents including Toprol-XL, Aldactone, Avapro and minoxidil.  Given the multitude of agents, it would be reasonable to screen this gentleman for secondary causes of hypertension including hyperthyroidism as well as hyperaldosteronism, but notably he has currently started the Aldactone and this would be difficult to do while on the medication.  We could consider in the future, if his blood pressure is not well controlled either washing out the Aldactone and then followed by renin and aldosterone testing versus BLANK sampling in the future if deemed necessary.  Additionally, if he is found to have coronary artery disease, one other option despite his lack of claudication would be evaluation of renal artery stenosis.  As mentioned, I will obtain the stress imaging tomorrow morning and then we will be able to have a better assessment of whether or not it would be reasonable to proceed with surgery in the near future.  I will follow back with him in approximately several months' time for followup of his general cardiovascular care.\n\nPlease do not hesitate to contact me if there is anything I can do to contribute to his ongoing medical care in the interim.  He has been provided both my e-mail and pager number to contact me if there is anything I can do to assist in his care going forward.\n\nThank you.\n\nSincerely,\n\n\n______________________________\nKenneth Sweet, MD\n\n\n\n\n\neScription document:9-9031123 IFFocus\n\nCC: Gabriel Michael MD\n67 COMANCHE STREET\n\nSHELTON, NH, 23574\nFax: \nEmail: gmichael@KCM.ORG\n\n\nCC: Phillip Isaac Crosby M.D.\nLamoni Nursing Rehabilitation Center\n725 Dan Chan\nShelton, NH, 64187\nFax: \nEmail: \n\n\n\nDD: 10/26/73\nDT: 10/27/73\nDV: 10/26/73\nRecord date: 2074-06-09\n\nReason for Visit This is a  47 year old  male referred to the diabetes management service for uncontrolled diabetes by Dr. OldhamChief Complaint This patient is admitted to the hospital for gastric bypassHistory of Present Illness The patient has a  10  year history of Type 2 diabetes.

Patient reports that 2 days ago, when he clean his feet, he noticed a piece of skin detached from his right outer foot. He removed the skin and cleaned the wound with alcohol swab and dressed with bind aid. He did not note any injury to his foot, did not find any foreign object in his shoes. He does recall that 5 days ago, his daughter broke a vase but he did not  step on it. The next day, he noticed right groin \npain and felt a lump in the area. The right foot became warmer and more painful. He however denies any chills, fever, shaking or diaphoresis. He has been diagnosed with DM for more than 20 years, was on insulin and had constant high blood glucose (&gt;600) most of the time before the gastric bypass surgery. He has neuropathy for more than 10 years. He had laparoscopic Roux-en-Y on 06/08/2074. His weight lost from 435 lbs before the Sx to 275 lbs. He is no longer on insulin.

She denies fever, \n\nchills, palpitations, and diarrhea.  She has not recently checked \n\nher blood sugar.\n\nPAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Diabetes mellitus, hypothyroidism, dementia, \n\nchronic ulcer of left great toe.  Past surgical history:  \n\nHysterectomy in the distant past.\n\nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  VITAL SIGNS:  Temperature 97.2, pulse 70, \n\nrespirations 18.  Blood pressure was initially 241/90.

As you know, she has a long and complex history of peripheral vascular disease with bilateral lower extremity bypass grafts.  Her left lower extremity bypass graft had occluded once previously, but was successfully restored by Dr. Tejeda.  In 02/61, we had detected a high-grade stenosis in the distal aspect of this graft by surveillance, and she underwent revision with a local patch angioplasty.  A subsequent ultrasound study done in 04/61 showed a widely patent graft and she has remained entirely asymptomatic.  She is not particularly active.  She denies any rest pain in the feet or significant claudication symptoms.  Recently, however, her husband had noticed some cyanosis of her left toes.  She remains on low dose aspirin in addition to Lipitor and her other medications.  She is a nonsmoker.\n\n\n\nOn examination today, she appeared well and in good spirits.  Blood pressure was measured at 130/60 in the right arm.  Lower extremity pulses are 2+ at the femoral level bilaterally.  On the right, there is a strong, easily appreciated pulse over her popliteal to dorsalis pedis bypass graft, and the foot is warm and well perfused.  On the left, I could not appreciate a pulse over her bypass graft incisions.  The left foot is slightly cooler than the right, and there are some mild cyanotic changes on the first toe in particular.  There are no frank or impending ulcerations or areas of irreversible ischemia.  There is a strong Doppler signal obtained over the posterior tibial artery at the ankle with an occlusion pressure of approximately 100 mmHg.  This yields an ankle index of nearly 0.7 and maybe falsely elevated.  A follow-up ultrasound study was performed in the vascular laboratory today.  The right lower extremity bypass remains widely patent.  As suspected, the left lower extremity bypass has now demonstrated to be occluded.\n\n\n\nMs. Ferrara left lower extremity bypass graft has occluded sometime during the last several months and her collateralization is clearly more marginal.  At the present time, she does not have any clear-cut symptoms of critical limb ischemia, though the slight discoloration of her toes is a clear sign.  The previous history of this graft including a prior thrombosis requiring thrombectomy and multiple revisions would not board well for any attempted thrombolysis or repeated rescue of this particular conduit.  Conversely, she has already had all of her lower extremity veins used for bypass operations and any redo bypass would be technically complicated.  I will need to review her previous angiograms from earlier this year to determine the status of her runoff and what the alternatives might be.  At the present time, however, she appears to have marginal, though reasonable collateralization and is essentially asymptomatic.  I think it would be reasonable to increase her antithrombotic therapy and I added a daily dose of Plavix to supplement a baby aspirin.  I spent sometime discussing the signs of worsening ischemia including more diffuse cyanotic skin changes of the toes, rest pain, or ulceration.  At a minimum, I will see her back in two months for reexamination, but I strongly encouraged the patient and her husband to contact us soon if there are any symptoms that suggest worsening of her circulation.  If her collateralization can remain stable, it certainly would be preferable to avoid having to consider a complex redo bypass with very limited remaining vein in this patient.\n\n\n\nThank you again for allowing us to participate in her care.  Please do not hesitate to contact me if I can be of further assistance.\n\n\n\nSincerely,\n\n\n\n______________________________\n\nRicardo Jacob Updyke, MD\n\n\n\n\n\nCC: Robin U.

She is now approximately one month out from a redo left popliteal to peroneal artery bypass graft using a basilic vein from right arm.  Postoperatively, she did well, although she was very sensitive to pain medication in the hospital and it was difficult to get her moving.  She complains of persistent weakness and numbness in her right hand and some pain shooting into her right forearm.  According to the patient, this was present early during her hospitalization, but because of other issues, it was not paid very much attention.  She denies any significant pain in the leg.\n\n\n\nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  On examination today, she appears generally well.  The right arm harvest site is healed well and the upper arm is soft without any evidence of hematoma, whatsoever.  The hand is warm and well perfused with intact distal pulses; however, she clearly has weakness of flexion of the first and second digits and some weakness of opposition.  She appears to have intact ulnar and radial function.  The lower extremity incision has also healed well and there is a strong Doppler signal over the peroneal artery at the ankle.  The foot is warm and well perfused and the previous ischemic lesion on the big toe is healing.  She had a followup graft scan today, which revealed her bypass graft to be patent with no evidence of significant narrowing.  The ankle index was measured at 0.88 on the left and 0.64 on the right.\n\n\n\nASSESSMENT AND PLAN:  Ms. Ferrara lower extremity circulation is stable and her bypass graft is functioning nicely.  Unfortunately, she appears to have had some neuropathic complication in her right arm that may have been related to her vein harvest surgery.  The exam suggests some possible partial comprise of median nerve function.  In any case, she is able to function reasonably well and a course of occupational therapy may improve things.  There is no evidence of compression from hematoma and no evidence of infection.  We will continue to follow her closely with a return visit scheduled in six weeks and a course of therapy was prescribed.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRicardo Jacob Updyke, MD\nRecord date: 2067-03-10\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPCC: Respiratory\n\n26 Monica Street\n\nBuena Vista, CT  84376\n\n272-413-0358\n\n\n\nFERRARA, LAUREN\n\n48185437\n\n03/10/2067\n\n\n\nMAJOR DIAGNOSIS:  Lung mass.\n\n\n\nHISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Lauren is a 75-year-old woman.  She has only a very remote history of smoking, smoking not at all after the age of 30.  In early March, she was undergoing a routine physical.  At that time, she reported she had some mild weight loss.  However, she had been trying to lose weight.  She had no respiratory symptoms of dyspnea or cough.  A chest x-ray was obtained, which revealed a 6 cm left lung mass.  The patient subsequently had a CT scan.  The CT scan revealed a 4 x 6 lung mass in the posterior subsegment of the right upper lobe.  There were some modestly enlarged hilar nodes, but all below 2 cm.  She has some tiny sub 5 mm nodules in both lungs.  The patient is referred by her primary care physician, Dr. Jordon for further evaluation.  The patient has no history of lung .  She has no history of asthma or allergies.  She has not had any history of TB or a positive PPD.  She may have had some mild asbestos exposure when she worked in a publishing company, which had asbestos containing pipes.  She has no history of malignancy.  She has no avocational exposures to dust or danders.\n\n\n\nPAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Includes:\n\n1.  Mild vascular dementia.\n\n2.  Hypertension.\n\n3.  Hyperlipidemia.\n\n4.  Diabetes.\n\n5.  Hypothyroidism.\n\n6.  Peripheral vascular disease.\n\n7.  Anemia.\n\n8.  Renal artery stenosis with mild renal failure.\n\n9.  Carotid artery stenosis.\n\n\n\nMEDICATIONS:  Levoxyl 88 mcg a day, Plavix 75 mg a day, Aricept 10 mg a day, furosemide 20 mg a day, nifedipine 90 mg a day, Crestor 20 mg a day, metoprolol 25 mg a day, calcium, Zetia 10 mg a day, vitamin D, Nephrocaps 1 mg a day, fish oil, aspirin 81 mg a day.\n\n\n\nALLERGIES:  Penicillin and estrogens and red dye #5.\n\n\n\nSOCIAL HISTORY:  She lives with her husband.  She does not drink.  She has a very remote smoking history in her teens and early 20s.\n\n\n\nFAMILY HISTORY:  Noncontributory.\n\n\n\nREVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  Otherwise, negative.\n\n\n\nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  She is in no distress.  Her O2 saturation is 95%.  Her blood pressure is 130/70, her pulse is 53.  Head and neck exam:  She is normocephalic and atraumatic.  Her nares are without discharge.  Oropharynx with dentures.  She has no erythema or exudate.  Neck is supple without adenopathy, thyromegaly, or bruits.  Her thorax is kyphotic.  She has normal fremitus and percussion.  Her lungs are clear.  Cardiac exam:  No JVD, S1, S2 without S3, S4, or murmurs.  Abdomen is soft.  Extremities have no clubbing, cyanosis, or edema.  She has residual of vascular surgery in her legs.  She has slightly diminished peripheral pulses.\n\n\n\nLABORATORY DATA:  Spirometry is normal.\n\n\n\nIMAGING STUDIES:  A chest CT is as noted.\n\n\n\nIMPRESSION AND PLAN:  A 75-year-old with a large right lung mass.  This is likely to be malignant, although a nonmalignant process or inflammatory processes are remotely possible.  At this point, I am going to refer her for a PET CT scan.  Her small nodules in her lung fields bilaterally are all sub 5mm and may not be related to this malignancy.  She does have modestly enlarged hilar nodes.  I am going to refer her to Thoracic Surgery for consideration of a mediastinoscopy and potential resection.  She would likely require cardiac clearance before this would occur.  She can follow up with me after her surgery if this proves to be an inflammatory lung disorder.  Otherwise, she will follow up with Oncology.  If she was deemed not to be an appropriate surgical candidate, either because of metastatic disease or because of comorbidity, she could have this lesion biopsied via a transthoracic needle aspirate.\n\n\n\n\n\n______________________________\n\nPamela Falk, M.D.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\neScription document:5-33744827 EMSSten Tel\n\n\n\nCC: Jaclyn Jordon M.D.\n\nMondovi Hospital\n\n566 Ferncroft Drive\n\nUnion City, CT, 33636\n\nFax: \n\nEmail: \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDD: 03/10/67\n\nDT: 03/10/67\n\nDV: 03/10/67"}

Will not attempt to lower BP beyond 150-160's for now to prevent drop in cerebral perfusion pressure.  Cont ativan 0.5-1 mg PO BID PRN.  Consider MRI/MRA to assess for RAS given such severe BP elevation.  Strict I/O's.\n\nF/E/N - Kayexalate 30g x 1, recheck K in AM, consider lasix.\n\nDM - Cont glyburide, check QID FS with insulin SS.

Patient becoming very frustrated regarding this.\n\n          Did not keep follow-up with Dr. Espinosa, the neurosurgeon she\n\n          initially saw. \n\n\n\n     (2)  Diabetes: Patient had her first eye exam yesterday with Dr. Dunn, who\n\n          actually is an optometrist.  He is referring her to a retinal specialist, due\n\n          to a question of cystoid macular edema, due to diabetic retinopathy and\n\n          some possible borderline intraocular pressures.  The patient is very\n\n          concerned regarding this. Is worried about her heart and kidneys, now\n\n          that she is having problems with her eyes.  Is trying to stick to her diet,\n\n          but is worried. Blood sugars at home have been mostly in the 200's,\n\n          occasionally high 100's.

Lengthy discussion of 20 to 30\n\n          minutes with patient regarding implications of this, as well as need for\n\n          better diabetic control, especially, as poorly-controlled diabetes is quietly\n\n          harming both her heart and her kidneys, as well as her blood vessels. \n\n          Patient seems more motivated now to try to adhere to diet and exercise.\n\n          Refer to Dr. Larry Kowalski, a retinal specialist, as soon as possible. Patient\n\n          promises to do her bloodwork for her RFT's, fasting lipids, FBS,\n\n          hemoglobin A1C, as well as urine microalbumin.

Her blood sugars have subsequently been low, reaching the 50s on several occasions.  At these times, she experiences diaphoresis and dizziness.  The pt took her morning insulin as usual, ate her normal breakfast, and at 4:30pm was walking to the kitchen when she got dizzy and felt her legs    turn to jelly.     She felt herself falling, yelled out to her son and landed on her left arm.  She lost consciousness.  Her son found her unresponsive and witnessed her vomit twice, drool, mumble and lose bladder continence.  She regained consciousness a few minutes later and was placed in an ambulance, where her BS was found to be 91.  She was brought to the DDCH ED, where plain films showed a fractured left humerus and a head CT was negative for bleed.     \n\n\n\nShe denies CP, SOB or palpitations.

He is complaining of a funny sensation in his neck and occasional soreness in his left neck.  Sometimes it hurts worse with breathing.  Sometimes he feels a little catch and a fleeting moment of shortness of breath.  Of note, he was admitted to the hospital last week for these symptoms.  He was admitted, I think 01/15-01/16.  He was ruled out for an MI and actually had a stress test, which showed no evidence of ischemia.  Furthermore, he was monitored the entire time, including while he was having this symptom of a funny feeling in his chest followed by a little shortness of breath or catching his breath as he describes it and no arrhythmia was documented whatsoever.  He was ultimately discharged from the hospital with the diagnosis of Costa chondritis.  He is describing this pain in his left neck and he wonders if it is somehow related to the pain in his chest.  He said he tried gargling with mouthwash some and that did seem to help a little.  This neck or throat pain has been going on for the past three days.\n\n\n\nPAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Remarkable for osteoarthritis, hypertension and other noncontributory problems.\n\n\n\nMEDICATIONS:  Aspirin, atenolol, Lipitor and vitamin E.\n\n\n\nALLERGIES:  None.\n\n\n\nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Today, he is alert and oriented.  His weight is 255.25 pounds, blood pressure 110/80, pulse 68, temperature 97.4.  Sinuses: Non-tender.  Nasal turbinates: Benign.  Tympanic membranes: With good light reflex, landmarks well seen.  Oropharynx: Without erythema, exudate, edema.  Neck: Supple, without adenopathy.  I am able to locate the spot that's bothering him by pressing on the mid outside of his left neck near where his carotid pulse is, but he does not have a lot of discomfort with this pressure and it does not seem to be quite what he is getting at.  Carotids are 2+ bilaterally.  Lungs: Clear to auscultation and percussion throughout.  Heart: Regular, without murmur, rub or gallop.\n\n\n\nASSESSMENT AND PLAN:  I was unable to find a clear etiology for Mr. Quevedo discomfort, although I think he is probably right that it is related to the musculoskeletal chest pain that he is having.  I did reassure him and tell him that it was okay for him to take ibuprofen for this as he had been directed in the hospital.  He does have an appointment to see Dr. Potter in follow-up in the next couple weeks and he will call or return if any new symptoms develop.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n______________________________\n\nRawan Pineda, M.D.\n\n\n\n\n\nDictated By: Rawan Pineda\n\n\n\n\n\neScription document:6-3221670 JSSten Tel\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDD: 01/23/83\n\nDT: 01/23/83\n\nDV: 01/23/83"}

Yamilex is a 68-year-old woman who I know quite well status post a stroke in 2083.  \n\nIn 2083 Mrs. Ordonez presented with ataxia and dizziness.  She was found to have a left vertebral stenosis and a left posterior inferior cerebellar artery distribution stroke.  She was found to be hypertensive at that time and was started on atenolol.  \n\nMrs. Ordonez blood pressure was not well controlled on atenolol and hydrochlorothiazide.  Triamterene was added.  Unfortunately she represented with recurrent ataxia and dizziness possibly due to overtreatment of her blood pressure.  Of note, she was only mildly orthostatic at that time.  She also had an E. coli urinary tract infection which may have been complicating matters.   \n\nMrs. Ordonez has had borderline glucose intolerance as well as an elevated alkaline/phosphatase.  She had had a hemoglobin A1C of 6% tested in 2083.  \n\nYamilex is generally doing well.  She has no particular complaints.  She has had an active summer getting out to the beach and walks the shopping mall with her daughter with good energy.  She has had no chest pains, shortness of breath, alterations in her bowel or bladder habits.  \n\nMedications:  Coumadin 2.5 alternating with 3.75 q.d. for her history of vertebral artery stenosis and atenolol 75 q.d.  \n\nPhysical examination:  Blood pressure was 170/90.  Heart rate was 82 and regular.  The HEENT examination was unremarkable.  Neck was supple without adenopathy.  There were 2+ carotids without bruits and there were no vertebral bruits.  Chest was clear to auscultation.  Cardiac exam showed an S4 gallop.  Abdomen examination was benign and extremities were without edema.  Neurological examination showed reflexes to be 2+ in the upper extremities and at the knees bilaterally with downgoing toes.  Finger-nose-finger was intact, Romberg was intact, and gait was stable with a narrow base.  \n\nAssessment and plan: \n\n1.\tHypertension.  Mrs. Ordonez blood pressure is currently not well controlled.  She has unfortunately had inadequate follow up for her hypertension.  I will start her on 5 mg. of Zestril in addition to her standing 75 of atenolol.  \n\n2.\tNeurologic.  Mrs. Ordonez is stable status post her stroke.  She will continue on Coumadin.  I will not plan any further neurological work up at this time.  \n\n3.\tPrimary care issues.  Mrs. Ordonez had a cholesterol in 2083 of 210.  I will test a follow up cholesterol level given that she needs good secondary prevention status post her stroke.  I will also check a random glucose level today as diabetes does run in the family and Mrs. Ordonez has had borderline elevated sugars in the past.  \n\n\tI have also started Mrs. Ordonez on a multivitamin with minerals as well as 800 IU a day of vitamin E at the recommendation of Dr. Quesenberry.  I will see Mrs. Ordonez in approximately six to eight weeks to reassess her blood pressure and her response to the addition of lisinopril.\n\nThe patient was seen with Richard Quesenberry, M.D. \n\n\n\nMichael Goldberg, M.D.\n\nHH:SF:0151\nDD:9-28-85\nDT:10-03-85\nDV:9-28-85\nRecord date: 2086-08-02\n\nThis is my first visit with Ms. Ordonez, for whom this is a routine physical.\n\n\n\n68 yo pleasant white woman with the following problems:\n\n\n\n1.  Left vertebral stenosis\n\nMs. Ordonez presented with ataxia and dizziness in 2083 and was found to have an infarct in the territory of the posterior inferior cerebellar artery.  Work-up revealed left vertebral stenosis.  She recovered after the event to her baseline, and now has no complaints of HA, dizziness, ataxia, paresthesias, or motor weakness.  She is chronically anticoagulated and followed in coumadin clinic; recent INR was 2.6.\n\n\n\n2.  Hypertension\n\nDuring her 2083 admission for CVA, Ms. Ordonez was found to be severely hypertensive.  She is now on Atenolol 75 mg po qd and Zestril 10 mg po qd for control of her hypertension.  She does not measure her blood pressure at home.  \n\n\n\n3.  Diabetes mellitus\n\nMs. Ordonez has NIDDM for which she takes Micronase 5 mg BID with fairly good control.  She has no known history of retinopathy, nephropathy, CAD, or neuropathy.  She has no complaints of visual changes, chest pain/SOB, paresthesias, or bloating/early satiety.  She has noticed some increase in thirst (7 glasses of water/day) which she attributes to the heat and she has nocturia (2x per night) which has been stable over a couple of years.  \n\n\n\n4.  Dyslipidemia  \n\nMs. Ordonez has a history of elevated total cholesterol; I don't think she has had a fasting lipid panel.\n\n\n\n5.  Benign breast disease\n\nMs. Ordonez has diffusely fibronodular breasts.  Microcalcifications were noted on mammography and bilateral excisional biopsies revealed benign fibroadenoma without evidence of malignancy.  Mammography on 7/28/86 was normal.  \n\n\n\n6.  Skin lesion\n\nMs. Ordonez has a skin lesion on her right temple which has developed over the course of a couple of months.  It is slightly sore to touch, and is non-pruritic and does not bleed.\n\n\n\nROS:  No HA, dizziness, ataxia, hearing loss, vision changes, chest pain/pressure, SOB, leg swelling, PND/orthopnea, diarrhea, nausea/vomiting, dysuria, incontinence, paresthesias, arthralgias, rash, fevers, cold or heat intolerance.  Does complain of mild chronic dry cough.\n\n\n\nHealth maintenance:  \n\nNo ASA (on Coumadin)\n\nNo recent pneumovax/influenza\n\nNo tetanus vaccine within 10 yrs\n\nDoes not do regular breast exams, mammography 7/28/86\n\nNo recent stool guaiac, has never had endoscopy\n\nHas never had pap smear\n\n\n\nPMH:\n\nPICA infarct in '83 \n\nLeft vertebral stenosis\n\nNIDDM\n\nHTN\n\ndyslipidemia\n\nR cataract removal\n\ns/p breast biopsy: benign fibroadenoma\n\n\n\nFamily hx:\n\nMother died of MI age 45\n\nFather died of MI age 72\n\nNo family hx colon CA\n\n\n\nSocial history:\n\n50 pack year hx, quit 2081\n\nRare ETOH\n\nLives with son, several children in area\n\nRetired\n\n\n\nAll:  NKDA\n\n\n\nMedications:\n\nMICRONASE (GLYBURIDE)  5MG PO BID   \n\nATENOLOL  75 MG PO QD   8/02/86\n\nCOUMADIN (WARFARIN SODIUM)   PO    \n\nZESTRIL (LISINOPRIL)  10MG PO QD   \n\n\n\nPE:\n\nObese woman in no apparent distress\n\nVS:  BP 170/90   HR 74   T 97.8   Weight 191 lbs\n\nHEENT:  No scleral icterus; fundi without hemorrhage, exudate, copper wiring or AV nicking; ear canals occluded with cerumen; OP no lesions; no thyromegaly; no LAD; no carotid bruits\n\nCV:  PMI not palpable, regular rate and rhythm, S2 with physiological splitting, no murmer/rubs/gallops\n\nCHEST:  Lungs resonant to percussion, clear to auscultation, without wheezes or crackles\n\nBreasts diffusely nodular, no asymmetry/dimpling/discharge, bilateral scars from excisional biopsies\n\nABD:  Soft, nontender, nondistended, positive bowel sounds, no hepatomegaly or spleen tip palpable, no abdominal bruits\n\nEXT:  Trace LE edema to ankles, no cyanosis or clubbing\n\nSKIN:  Keratotic 1 cm lesion on R temple\n\nNEURO:  PERRL, CN II-VIII and XII tested and intact, motor strength 5/5 throughout, light touch sensation intact in distal extremities, finger-nose and heel/shin testing intact\n\nRECTAL/GU:  deferred\n\n\n\nTests:\n\nUA negative (including protein)\n\nFasting lipid panel, CBC, Chem 7, HbA1C pending\n\n\n\nImpression by problem:\n\n\n\n1.  Left vertebral stenosis:  Patient has not had recurrent symptoms since her CVA in 2083 and she is neurologically intact by my neuro exam.  She is therapeutic on her coumadin.  She will continue coumadin and I will attempt to address CVA risk factors such as HTN and dyslipidemia (will avoid lowering BP excessively to preserve vertebral perfusion).\n\n\n\n2.  Hypertension:  Patient is quite hypertensive (170/90) on current regimen of Atenolol 75 mg qd and Zestril 10 mg qd.  Her heart rate is 74; I will increase her Atenolol to 100 mg qd.  She does not complain of any side effects from her medications.  She does have a chronic, mild dry cough which is possibly related to her Zestril.  \n\n\n\n3.  Diabetes Mellitus\n\nMs. Ordonez takes Micronase 5 mg BID for blood sugar control; she does not measure her glucose at home.  She has had a little polydipsia/polyuria.  Today I will check a glucose and HbA1c level.  Her UA today is negative and I will check a spot urine microalbumin/Cr ratio.  On her next visit I will schedule an ophthalmology appointment.  She is on an ACE inhibitor.\n\n\n\n4.  Dyslipidemia\n\nThe patient has had a recent cholesterol of 206.  I will obtain a fasting lipid panel.\n\n\n\n5.  Benign breast disease\n\nExcisional biopsy showed benign fibroadenoma, mammography on 7/28/86 was normal.  She has diffuse fibronodular disease on exam today.  I have instructed her in self-examination.\n\n\n\n6.  Skin lesion\n\nMs. Ordonez' skin lesion looks like it may be a suborrheic keratosis or squamous cell.  I will refer to a dermatologist.\n\n\n\n7.  Health maintenance\n\nI discussed both hormone replacement therapy and screening flexible sigmoidoscopy with Ms. Ordonez and she has declined both.  She also does not want a pneumovax today, although she is willing to have her tetanus.  She has also agreed to start taking calcium/vitamin D as well as an MVI.

She first noted drainage from her left great toe five days prior to admission.  This was accompanied by toe swelling, fevers to 100.5 and chills, but she denies pain in her L great toe.  Almost simultaneous with the drainage from her L great toe, she also noted increasing pain from the lateral aspect of the plantar surface of her left forefoot, especially when walking.  She denies any trauma to her left foot.  She reports that the ulcer on her right lateral foot is stable, and she has been dressing it with Panafil ointment as prescribed by Dr. Salgado.  She denies any rest pain, and reports that her prior claudication is almost fully resolved following her R SFA angioplasty last year.  She presented today to Dr. Salgado&#8217;s clinic for routine follow-up, when wet gangrene of her L great toe was detected on clinical exam.

Prior ankle/brachial index (ABI) was .69.  Pulse volume recordings (PVR) and segmental limb pressures suggest inflow aorto-iliac/common femoral/profunda femoris/or proximal superficial femoral artery disease, and popliteal artery/tibial vessel  at rest.  The toe/brachial index is 0.LEFT:  The patient is s/p a left superficial femoral artery pta and stent since last exam.  The ankle/brachial index (ABI) is .81.  Prior ankle/brachial  index (ABI) was .55.  Pulse volume recordings (PVR) and segmental limb pressures suggest mild inflow aorto-iliac/common femoral/profunda femoris/or proximal superficial femoral artery disease, and popliteal/tibial vessel disease at rest.  The toe/brachial index is .28 (taken from 2nd toe).IMPRESSION1. Severe peripheral arterial disease in the right leg.2.

Was seen in ED at OSH and sent home.  She continued to vomit, went to another hospital where she stayed for a week, and had a cholecystectomy.  She felt better at home for 4 days after discharge, but had recurrent vomiting, back to ED, admitted again and discharged after a week-long stay.  She now comes to PSH after four episodes of emesis yesterday.\n\n\tPt reports intermittent periumbilical pain, which worsens right before a bout of emesis, then dies down after the emesis.  Pain does not radiate; pt not able to characterize frequency, duration, or quality of the pain.  No obvious relationship between pain and PO intake.\n\n\tIn between episodes of vomiting, she feels increased amount of secretions in her mouth that she has to spit out.  Denies any dysphagia or odynophagia.  No melena or hematochezia.  Had had constipation, which resolved with laxatives, more recently having 2 BMs/day.\n\n\tShe does not recall the workup at OSH but thinks she may have had EGD and colonoscopy already, which she reports did not show any abnormality.\n\n\n\nROS:  no fever or night sweats.  No odynophagia or dysphagia.  No rash.  No CP, SOB, LE edema.  Appetite was good and no weight changes before 12/26/80; since then, she is afraid to eat and has lost weight and feels    weak   \n\n\n\nPMH\t\t\t\n\nDM\n\nHTN\n\nS/p cholecystectomy on 1/04/81\n\nNo TB or exposure to TB\n\n\n\nMeds currently\n\nZestril\n\nReglan\n\nAtivan\n\nColace\n\nASA\n\n\n\nALL:   Percocet    GI upset.\n\n\n\nSHx:\t lives alone  \n\nETOH:  none\n\nTobacco:  never\n\nDrugs:  never\n\n\n\nFHx:  \t no GI malignancy or IBD\n\n\n\nPE\tafeb\t193/1-9\t\t94\t\t18\t\t98% on RA\n\nGeneral:\tmiddle-aged woman, thin, in some distress in the midst of vomiting green liquid\n\nSkin:\tno jaundice; no rash\n\nHEENT:\tbenign OP\n\nChest:  \tCTA bilaterally anteriorly\n\nCardiac:  \tRRR, nl S1 & S2\n\nAbd:\t\tsoft, obese, not distended, mild diffuse tenderness without guarding or rebound, liver edge not palpable, good BS\n\nRectal:\t\tdeferred; pt in midst of vomiting; ED resident did rectal exam yesterday showing nl anal sphincter tone and scant gu- stool\n\nExtremities:\tno peripheral edema\n\nNeuro:\tawake and alert and appropriate\n\n\n\nLabs:\n\n10-Feb-2081 03:24  \n\nSodium (Stat Lab)                134              L        (135-145)      mmol/L\n\nPotassium (Stat Lab)             3.3              L        (3.4-4.8)      mmol/L\n\nChloride (Stat Lab)              105                       (100-108)      mmol/L\n\nCO2 (Stat Lab)                   26.6                      (23.0-31.9)    mmol/L\n\nBUN (Stat Lab)                   16                        (8-25)         mg/dl\n\nCreatinine (Stat Lab)            0.9                       (0.6-1.5)      mg/dl\n\nGlucose (Stat Lab)               274              H        (70-110)       mg/dl\n\n\n\n09-Feb-2081 21:21  \n\nTotal Protein                    7.9                       (6.0-8.3)      g/dl\n\nAlbumin                          3.7                       (3.3-5.0)      g/dl\n\nGlobulin                         4.2              H        (2.6-4.1)      g/dl\n\nDirect Bilirubin                 0.1                       (0-0.4)        mg/dl\n\nTotal Bilirubin                  0.4                       (0.0-1.0)      mg/dl\n\nAlkaline Phosphatase             78                        (30-100)       U/L\n\nTransaminase-SGPT                12                        (7-30)         U/L\n\nAmylase                          103              H        (3-100)        units/L\n\nLipase                           7.8              H        (1.3-6.0)      U/dl\n\nTransaminase-SGOT                15                        (9-32)         U/L\n\n\n\n09-Feb-2081 21:08  \n\nWBC                              5.9                       (4.5-11.0)     th/cmm\n\nHCT                              41.3                      (36.0-46.0)    %\n\nHGB                              14.3                      (12.0-16.0)    gm/dl\n\nRBC                              5.00                      (4.00-5.20)    mil/cmm\n\nPLT                              300                       (150-350)      th/cumm\n\nMCV                              83                        (80-100)       fl\n\nMCH                              28.6                      (26.0-34.0)    pg/rbc\n\nMCHC                             34.6                      (31.0-37.0)    g/dl\n\nRDW                              12.8                      (11.5-14.5)    %\n\n\n\nPoly                             56                        (40-70)        %\n\nLymphs                           38                        (22-44)        %\n\nMonos                            4                         (4-11)         %\n\nEOS                              1                         (0-8)          %\n\nBasos                            1                         (0-3)          %\n\n\n\nAbd CT:  The liver, spleen, pancreas, adrenal glands and kidneys\n\n\tare unremarkable on this unenhanced CT.\n\n\tThere is diverticulosis of the sigmoid colon without CT evidence\n\n\tof diverticulitis.

Question of TI thickening and gastric thickening (but may appear that way only due to underdistention).  As per pt, she has had EGD and colonoscopy at OSH already.  Would suggest obtaining records from Fairview-Southdale Hospital first before decision regarding repeat w/u here.  Workup may entail gastric emptying scan to assess for gastroparesis, EGD and colonoscopy to evaluate for malignancy or IBD, brain imaging to r/o CNS process.  Can continue to try Reglan 10mg up to QID.\n\n\n\nWill staff with Dr. Otis Aguilera later today.\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t_______\n\nRegina Dorsey, M.D.\nRecord date: 2081-06-10\n\n\n\nAttending Admission Note\n\n\n\nHPI\n\n52 year old woman with DM and h/o gastroparesis who presented with nausea and vomiting.  She was last admitted one week ago with N/V and treated for gastroparesis.  Her diabetes has been poorly controlled with her last hemoglobin A1c over 12 in April of 2081.  She has had recurrent episodes of nausea and vomiting.  During this past year in January, she was admitted to Missouri Baptist Hospital.  She had a negative EGD, and HIDA scan showed low ejection fraction to cholecystokinase.  She underwent a laparoscopic cholecystectomy.  She was admitted again a few weeks later to Missouri Baptist and had a gastric emptying study, which was consistent with gastroparesis.  In February, she was seen in the Philadelphia State Hospital Emergency Room with nausea and vomiting and had a KUB, which showed significant stool.  She presented again on 02/11/2081 and had an abdominal CT that showed thickening of the terminal ileum and possible thickening of the gastric and possible duodenal wall.  GI was consulted and the colonoscopy done on 02/14/2081 was normal, but did not visualize the terminal ileum.  A small-bowel follow-through on 02/16/2081 was normal.  She was discharged on a regimen of Reglan and erythromycin.  Since February, she has been seen multiple times in the outpatient clinic as well as medical walk-in.  She reports being complaint with her regimen of erythromycin 250 mg four times a day and Reglan 10 mg twice a day.  She was also recently started on Glucophage titrating up to 1000 mg b.i.d. as she had difficulty with multiple short per day regimen of insulin administration.  \n\n\n\nShe was admitted from 5/31-6/2 and treated with IV Zofran and enemas.  GI saw the pt and recommended increasing reglan to TID and adding colace and miralax.  She also had a head CT to r/o mass lesion causing the nausea, and this was negative.  At the time of d/c, her nausea had decreased.  She states that the N/V did not improve much since that admission, and she has not been able to eat much.  She has pain throughout her abdomen.

Her GI symptoms began in December, 2080. Delayed gastric emptying by nuclear medicine study, with 9% emptying at 60 minutes and 29% emptying at 90 minutes. \n\n\n\nOriginally, she had been on oral medication and has been on insulin since 2076, initially on NPH bid and then switched to Lantus.  After her admission June 2081, she was placed back on NPH from what had been lantus 40 U qhs + metformin 1000 bid. HbA1C was 12.2, 4/2081, more recently it has been 10.2 in 7/2081 and 10.1 on 9/14/2081. \n\n\n\nOn her last visit to see me in diabetes counseling approximately 10 days ago, gastroparesis was under good control without nausea or vomiting. Glycemic control, however, was poor, and it was clear to me that she was not properly administering a sliding scale, and this was too complex for her. Accordingly, and in response to severe hyperglycemia and a hemoglobin A1c above 10, we changed her reigimen to NPH 70/30 50Units BID. \n\nHer known diabetic complications include retinopathy with prior photocoagulopathy, nephropathy with microalbuminuria, neuropathy with intermittent numbness and tingling at night in feet, and no known macrovascular disease. Gastroparesis may be the consequence of poor glycemic control or frank autonomic neuropathy, but is often multifactorial. \n\nShe was re-admitted to the PSH on 09/30/2081 after having 2 days of nausea, vomiting, and anorexia. She was unable tolerate any oral hydration in the ED, and was admitted for management. \n\nOn ROSystems and history, she reports that she had been taking her new 70/30 insulin, 50 units BID. Sugars had been running 200s, all the time 200s, no better or worse. Nausea per her report began suddenly on Friday evening 09/27 and got gradually worse. Currently nausea has abated, but abdominal pain persists.\n\nWritten only for insulin sliding scale. Glucose 500+ on admission with anion gap of 20 that closed rapidly with hydration.  \n\n\n\nPMH: \n\n1)\tDM (from 2061a)\n\n2)\tgastroparesis \n\n3)\tretinopathy (s/p laser Rx 03/81)\n\n4)\tnephropathy\n\n5)\tHTN\n\n6)\ts/p cholecystectomy\n\n7)\ts/p TAH/BSO\n\nALL: Percocet\n\nMEDS: \n\n1)\tInsulin 70/30 NPH/Regular 50U BID\n\n2)\tASA 325 QD\n\n3)\tLisinopril 40 mg qam\n\n4)\tAtenolol 50 mg QD \n\n5)\tReglan 10 mg bid-qid\n\n6)\tLexapro 10mg QD\n\n7)\tColace 100mg bid\n\n8)\tMiralax 17g QD\n\n9)\tNexium 40 mg QD\n\n10)\tAtivan 0.5-1mg tid\n\n11)\tZofran 8mg bid\n\n12)\tHydrochlorothiazide\n\n13)\tNorvasc 5 QD\n\n14)\tZelnorm\n\n15)\tMetformin 500 QD titrating up to 1000 BID (started on last visit, she has not taken it yet.\n\nSH: Lives alone in Coshocton, from Herzegovina, sister in town.

Found to be profoundly hyperglycemic on admission with BG of 526 with anion gap of 20. Rapidly closed anion gap to 10 with hydration alone.  Abdominal pain can be multifactorial. I don't doubt that this is most likely hyperglycemia with associated gut dysmotility, but differential includes small bowel angina (pain is definitely out of proportion to exam and seems colicky), hepatobiliary disease. With normal anion gap, I doubt that this is ischemic disease of the gut, but small bowel angina is still a possibility. \n\nRecommendations: \n\n1)\t Gastroparesis may be in part due to poor glycemic control, we need to achieve better glycemic control to help with gastric motility. \n\na.\tWould not hold long acting insulin. Start NPH 30U BID,    dose if NPO\n\nb.\tWhile NPO, have D5 running in IVF once fingerstick drops below 200, especially once NPH started. If she needs IVF at a higher rate, you might run D5NS at 50cc/hour along with NS or    NS at whatever rate is needed.\n\nc.\tContinue sliding scale insulin Q6H when NPO, QAC and QHS when eating, but change parameters to tighten coverage as follows:\n\ni.\tFingerstick <150, 0 units; 151-200 4 units; 201-250 6 units; 251-300 8 units; 301-350 10 units, >350 12 units. \n\nd.\tStart mealtime insulin (clearly hold while NPO) of 10U regular pre-breakfast and pre-dinner. Hold if NPO or PO intake poor. She will need rapid uptitration from this point once eating. \n\ne.\tNo metformin for now given GI upset. \n\n2)\tAgree with other therapies for gastroparesis as she had been on as an outpatient, including ativan, reglan, zofran PRN, zelnorm, miralax, colace. \n\n3)\tFor crude r/o of poor circulation to gut you could send a lactate level and check stool guaiac. Colonoscopy and endoscopic exams were normal earlier this year, but this does not exclude small bowel angina. Study of choice would be MR angiography or CT angiography of abdominal vessels. I do not think this is warranted at this point, but ischemic small bowel should remain on the differential.  \n\n4)\tWith hyperdynamic precordium and tachycardia, would check TSH, though this is almost certainly due to hypovolemia and compensatory response. \n\nThank you for the consult.  \n\nWe will follow with you.  Please call with any questions.\n\nWill staff in AM. \t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t______________________\n\n\tMark Kenney, MD, PhD\n\n\tPager # 12036\nRecord date: 2083-02-26\n\n \nAttending Admission Note\n\nHPI:  54 year old woman with h/o DM, HTN, and depression who is transferred to PSH from Missouri Baptist Hospital after being admitted from 2/15-2/20/83 and then readmitted on 2/22 with abdominal pain, nausea, and vomiting.  She has a h/o several admisions to the hospital for abdominal pain attributed to diabetic gastroparesis.  She has had an extensive GI work-up in the past including multiple abdominal CT scans, gastric emptying study, colonoscopy, upper endoscopy, and small bowel follow through.  All studies were negative except for the gastric emptying study.  She has been treated with multiple medications, including Reglan, Ativan, Compazine, and Zelnorm without much effect.  She is currently taking Neurontin and Cymbalta to treat neuropathic pain, and her PCP started her on MS Contin in December since nothing else seemed to be helping.  The pt states that the MS Contin helped during the month of December, but then it did not seem to be working as well.  The pt is distraught over her symptoms because the pain is severe and frequent.  She has been unable to return to work for 2 years because of the pain, and she would like to be able to do so.  The pain is not necessarily related to eating.  Yesterday, she felt well and was able to eat.  Today, she was doing fine until she had to drink the gastrografin, and then it escalated to an 8/10.  She received some IV morphine, and now it is down to 4/10.\n\tAt Missouri Baptist Hospital, her MS Contin was held, but when her BP went up, she was restarted on it.  They also started clonidine BID for her uncontrolled HTN.  It appears that a AFP level was drawn and was elevated at 11.1.  However, it is written multiple times in the transfer materials that she had an elevated CEA level of 11.1.\n\nProblems\nDiabetes mellitus : since 2060's, poorly controlled\nHypertension \nGastroparesis : N/V due to diabetes\nRetinopathy : due to AODM, s/p first laser treatment 3/81, found to have swelling of the optic discs in 8/82 and evaluated at PCH\nS/P cholecystectomy \nS/P TAH/BSO : menopause at age 46 \n\nMedications (on transfer)\nHeparin 5000 u SQ BID\nReglan 10 mg IV Q 6 hours\nHydrochlorothiazide 25 MG (25MG TABLET take 1) PO QAM , for high blood pressure\nInsulin 70/30 HUMAN 70-30 U/ML VIAL SC as directed , 25u SQ before breakfast and 15u before dinner.\nNexium 40 mg po QD\nLisinopril 20MG TABLET PO QAM \n\nMedications (as an outpatient)\nAsa (ACETYLSALICYLIC ACID) 325 MG (325MG TABLET take 1) PO QD \nCymbalta (DULOXETINE) 60MG CAPSULE DR PO QAM x 30 days\nHydrochlorothiazide 25 MG (25MG TABLET take 1) PO QAM , for high blood pressure\nInsulin 70/30 HUMAN 70-30 U/ML VIAL SC as directed , 60u SQ before breakfast and 40u before dinner.\nLipitor (ATORVASTATIN) 10MG TABLET PO QHS \nLisinopril 40MG TABLET PO QAM \nMs CONTIN (MORPHINE CONTROLLED RELEASE) 15MG TABLET SA PO Q12H \nNeurontin (GABAPENTIN) 300 MG (300MG CAPSULE take 1) PO TID \nPotassium CHLORIDE SLOW REL.

Spot compression views of the terminal\n     ileum are normal. The transit time was normal.\n     \n\nIMPRESSION\n     NORMAL SMALL BOWEL SERIES.\n     \nAssessment and Plan\t\n54 yo woman with DM, HTN, and depression who has had severe chronic abdominal pain x 2 years.  Extensive GI w/u has been negative except for gastric emptying study.\n1.  GI: Pain is responsive to morphine.  Will continue MS contin and treat with IV morphine prn for breakthrough pain.  Gastroparesis has been a working diagnosis since all other testing has been negative.  She has other complications of DM which does put her at increased risk for autonomic dysfunction of the GI tract.  Other diagnoses to consider are bowel ischemia, although colonoscopy and CT scans in the past have not shown any changes in the bowel consistent with this diagnosis.  We will order CTA of the abdomen to rule this out.  She did have a negative anti-endomysial Ab in 2081, but I think it would be worth checking both anti-endomysial Ab and anti-gliadin Ab to r/u celiac sprue again.  We will send both an AFP and CEA levels to f/u on the unclear laboratory abnormality from Missouri Baptist Hospital.\n2.  HTN:  BP is very elevated today, and this may in part be due to stopping the clonidine (which may have been given to help with GI motility).  Will continue her on her 40 mg dose of Lisinopril and 25 mg of HCTZ.  In addition, we will treat her with hydralazine until we can get the BP down.\n3.  DM:  Will  treat with Insulin NPH 25 u Q am, 20 u Q pm and with sliding scale regular insulin.  Will monitor BS.\n4.  Pain management:  Will continue Cymbalta and Neurontin along the the MS Contin and prn IV morphine.\n\n\n\n_____________________________________________\nMildred D. Yunker, M.D."}

They would like to discuss the following issues:\n\n1.  Shoulder pain:  She continues to have bilateral shoulder pain, but the L shoulder is worse than the right.  She has been taking Prednisone 9 mg a day for a long time but has not f/u with Rheum for about a year.  She did have a cortisone in the L shoulder in the past.  She is able to lift her arms over her head.\n\n2.  Depression:  Her family feels that she is doing much better on the Effexor than the Celexa.  The pt has seen Dr. Ramsey in Psych a few months ago.  \n\n3.  Dementia:  Dr. Ramsey recommended continuing on the Aricept.  Overall, the pt's family feels that her memory is worsening, although some days are better than others.  She has not had any other episodes of halluncination, as was described in an email from her son a couple weeks ago.  The pt states that she is sleeping and eating well, but her family thinks that she sleeps too much.\n\n4.  Eyelid surgery:  She is scheduled to have surgery on her eyelids on May 25.  The drooping of the lids is so bad by the end of the day that she is unable to read.\n\n5.  Incontinence:  She has now had 3 collagen implants for her bladder.  The pt does not think that she is any better, but when Dr. Xuereb tested her a few months ago, she saw some improvement.\n\n6.  Diarrhea:  She has about 2 soft BM's a day, but she also has intermittent diarrhea.  Her daughter-in-law is wondering if the pt might be lactose intolerant.  She is not having any blood in her stool.  She does not have any diarrhea in the middle of the night.  She has never gotten a colonoscopy since the last attempt just prior to her hospitalization 2 years ago.\n\n7.  DM:  The pt states that she does not eat much sugar, but her daughter-in-law thinks that she probably does consume a fair number of sweets.\n\n8.  Hyperlipidemia: She has been on Zocor 20 mg QD but is not following a low fat diet.\n\n9.  Medication compliance:  The pt's family is not sure if she is taking her medications every day.  They pay a private nurse to come lay out the meds in the am, but the pt is often asleep when she comes and will not get up to take the meds at that time.\n\n10.  Onychomycosis:  The pt has a fungal infection in her great toes.  Her daughter-in-law is wondering if there is anything topical to treat this with.  The pt gets regular pedicures.\n\n\n\nProblems\n\nUrinary incontinence : s/p sling procedure in 4/91; s/p 3 prior bladder suspension surgeries\n\nHypertension \n\nDepression \n\nElevated cholesterol \n\nDiarrhea \n\nPolymyalgia rheumatica : diagnosed in 1/91\n\nS/P rectocele repair \n\nParoxysmal atrial fibrillation : controlled with medication\n\nPeripheral neuropathy : unclear etiology\n\nHyperlipidemia \n\nH/O Alcohol abuse \n\nS/P urosepsis : admission in 9/90\n\nchronic diarrhea : colonoscopy attempted in 9/90 but pt not able to tolerate procedure\n\nDementia : Mild-moderate; neuropsychiatric test done in 5/91 \n\nDiverticulitis:  Hospitalized in 7/92\n\n\n\nMedications\n\nFolic ACID PO QD (1MG TABLET take 1 Tablet(s))\n\nEcotrin (ASPIRIN ENTERIC COATED) PO QD (325MG TABLET EC take 1 Tablet(s))\n\nMetoprolol TARTRATE PO TID (50MG TABLET take 1 Tablet(s))\n\nThiamine HCL PO QD (100MG TABLET take 1 Tablet(s))\n\nDigoxin PO QD (0.125MG TABLET take 1 Tablet(s))\n\nFerrous SULFATE PO QD (325MG TABLET take 1 Tablet(s))\n\nMvi (MULTIVITAMINS) 1CAPSULE PO QD \n\nCalcium CARBONATE VIT D(1TABLET=250MG E... 500MG PO TID \n\nNitrofurantoin PO QD (100MG CAPSULE take 1 Capsule(s))\n\nZocor (SIMVASTATIN) PO QHS (20MG TABLET take 1 Tablet(s) x 30 days)\n\nGlyburide PO QD (2.5MG TABLET take 1 Tablet(s))\n\nPrednisone PO QAM (5MG TABLET take 1 Tablet(s))\n\nPrednisone PO QAM (1MG TABLET take 4 Tablet(s)), total 9 mg/d\n\nEffexor SR (VENLAFAXINE EXTENDED RELEASE) PO QD (37.5MG CAPSULE CR take 1 Capsule(s))\n\nSotalol PO BID (80MG TABLET take 1 Tablet(s))\n\nAricept (DONEPEZIL HCL) 10MG PO QHS (x 30 days)\n\nEffexor (VENLAFAXINE HCL) PO QD (37.5MG TABLET take 4 Tablet(s)) \n\n\n\nHealth maintenance\n\nCholesterol 05/24/2092 223 \n\nStool Guaiac 12/21/2091 Done - positive 12/09/91;12/11/91;12/12/91.All slides positive.\n\nUA-Protein 01/18/2093 NEGATIVE \n\nHBA1C 05/25/2092 7.30 \n\nUrine Culture 01/18/2093 see report in Results CATHETERIZED SPECIMEN\n\nTriglycerides 08/26/2091 330 \n\nCholesterol-LDL 08/26/2091 148 \n\nBone Density 06/16/2091 BMD-Hip \n\nHct (Hematocrit) 12/07/2092 40.7 \n\nCholesterol-HDL 05/24/2092 43 \n\nHgb (Hemoglobin) 12/07/2092 13.7 \n\nSyphilis 09/14/2090 FINAL Result NON-REACTIVE. \n\n\n\nAllergies\n\nNKDA \n\n\n\nSocial History\t\n\nLives in Forest Hills, an assisted living facility; never smoking; Etoh- rare- she might have one drink if she goes to her son's house for dinner; exercise- walking.\n\n\n\nFamily History\t\n\nFamily History: mother died at 89 of \"old age\"; father died of unknown causes; no breast or colon ca; brother is s/p MI before age 60; + DM.\n\n\n\nReview of Systems\t\n\nNo change in weight, appetite.

PMR:  Discussed the importance of regular f/u with Dr. Inge.  We should aim to get the dose of Prednisone decreased.  Will check ESR today.  Franchesca will make sure appt is scheduled with Dr. Inge.\n\n2.  Depression:  She seems better.  Continue Effexor. \n\n3.  Dementia:  Will continue Aricept.  Discussed keeping pt stimulated with outings, family visits.  Her excessive sleeping is likely a combination of several factors, including her multiple medications, depression, and possibly the dementia.\n\n4.  Eyelid surgery:  Pre-op exam today.  Will order complete metabolic panel, CBC, and EKG.\n\n5.  Incontinence:  It is not likely that she will be able to have any more procedures at this point.  Some of the incontinence may be secondary to dementia rather than pure stress incontinence.\n\n6.  Diarrhea:  Discussed trying a lactose-free diet for a week to determine if lactose-intolerance may be playing a role.  Will set up a virtual colonoscopy since the pt had such a bad experience with the sedation for her colonoscopy 2 years ago.\n\n7.  DM:  Check glucose and Hgb A1C.\n\n8.  Hyperlipidemia: Check fasting lipids- she will get them drawn at Dameron Hospital.\n\n9.  Medication compliance: Discussed trying to get nurse to come a little later in the day so that pt could be observed while taking her medication.\n\n10.  Onychomycosis:  I do not think oral medication would be a good idea for this patient because the risks of hepatotoxicity outweigh the benefits.  Will refer her to Podiatry for care of the toenails since the pt has a h/o peripheral neuropathy.\n\n11.  Health maint:  Order mammo to be done at DH; TSH.\n\n\n\n\n\n_____________________________________________\n\nFaith G.

Per the patient's son, the staff at her facility has noted the patient to be more confused over the last 3 days.  She has had more frequent episodes of fecal incontinence with soiling of her bed and carpet. Some blood was also noted in her toilet. Her son also reports that she has been less awake than usual and has had some congestion and coughing.  She has had no fevers, chills, chest pain, sob, nausea, vomiting, or urinary symptoms. A urinalysis was reportedly positive at her assisted living facility and the patient was sent to the emergency department for further evaluation. \n\n\n\nAt baseline, the patient is generally quite confused.  She knows her name and often location but not the date/year and talks frequently of her late husband and parents whom she believes are still alive. Her assisted living facility has recently suggested that she be transferred to their higher level of care program.\n\n\n\nED: T 98.1, P 110, R 20, BP 130/56, SaO2 98% RA. She has dry MM. Lungs clear.

The patient was treated with levofloxacin 500mg po and 3LNS, as well as many of her home meds, including Lopressor, Sotalol, prednisone, iron, thiamine, folic acid, mvi, calcium, glyburide, and effexor. Aspirin was held. She was transfused one unit of PRBCs and admitted to medicine for further evaluation.\n\n\n\nPMH:   \n\n1.\t        Dementia\n\n2.\tParoxysmal atrial fibrillation \t\n\n3.\t        Hypertension \n\n4.\tDiabetes\n\n5.\tHyperlipidemia\n\n6.\tDepression \n\n7.\tPolymyalgia rheumatica- dx 1/91. on steroids.\n\n8.\tChronic diarrhea-  evaluated by GI in 10/94 felt likely IBS and fecal incontinence\n\n9.\tH/o  Urosepsis- 9/90\n\n10.\tH/o Diverticulitis- 7/92\n\n11.\tUrinary incontinence: s/p sling procedure in 4/91; s/p 3 prior bladder suspension sx\n\n12.\tS/P rectocele repair \n\n13.\tPeripheral neuropathy : unclear etiology\n\n14.\tH/o Alcohol abuse \n\n\n\nMedications on admission (from ALF):\n\n1.\t       aricept 10mg po qd\n\n2.\tdigoxin 0.125mg po qd\n\n3.\tfolic acid 1mg po qd\n\n4.\tnitrofurantoin 100mg po qd\n\n5.\tzocor 80mg po qd\n\n6.\tglyburide 10mg po qd\n\n7.\tprednisone 5mg po qd\n\n8.\tcalcium 600/D tid\n\n9.\tthiamine 100mg po qd\n\n10.\tferrous sulfate one tab po qd\n\n11.\tMVI\n\n12.\tasa 325mg po qd\n\n13.\tsotalol 80mg po bid\n\n14.\teffexor 37.5 2 tabs po bid\n\n15.\tlopressor 50mg po tid\n\n\n\n \n\nALL:  Demerol\n\nSH: Lives in assisted living (Forest Hils).

Ms. Do has had two prior hospitalizations for cellulitis/osteomyelitis. In 2104, she developed osteomyelitis following a fall, requiring surgery for debridment (right leg).  In 2106, she was also admitted to Seymour Hospital with cellulitis of right leg and required a 2-week course of IV antibiotics.  At this presentation, she has been in her usual state of health (ET 25 feet, limited by pain in legs, no dyspnea, no chest pain) until last Tuesday when she presented to her podiatrist for a corn removal (right foot). The podiatrist made an observation that she had some erythema on the dorsal part of the foot. She was not experiencing any pain.  Over this past week, she noted that the erythema and some swelling had extended, now to include the anterior portion of the lower shin.  She presented to EFHC for a follow-up appointment, and was treated with Keflex po.

Other potential causes include osteo or DVT. At this point, there is little to suspect osteo in this patient.\na.\tBlood cultures\nb.\tGiven her multiple problems, requires broad spectrum coverage - Zosyn 2.25 g IV q6 h (CrCl 45)\nc.\tElevate the leg\nd.\tWarm compresses to increased circulation\ne.\tMark the extent of cellulitis and monitor progression with therapy\nf.\tIf cellulitis does not improve - will get imaging to evaluate for underlying infection.

Do is an 81-year-old right-handed white woman with seropositive, nodular, erosive rheumatoid arthritis that was diagnosed in 2060, type II noninsulin-dependent diabetes mellitus, vascular insufficiency in her legs, peripheral neuropathy, hearing loss in her left ear, right total hip arthroplasty surgery in 2070, right total knee arthroplasty surgery in 2081, left total knee arthroplasty surgery in 2082, a lumbar fusion performed in 2098 and again in 2099, a sigmoid colonic resection in 2103, cellulitis and osteomyelitis involving her right foot in October 2104, a cataract extracted from her right eye in 2102, a cataract extracted from her left eye in 2103, a transient ischemic attack in June 2106, and cellulitis involving her legs in 2107.  She returns to see me in rheumatologic follow-up at Rheumatology, this morning.  \n \nMs. Do has continued to take prednisone 5 mg by mouth twice daily, Celebrex 200 mg by mouth twice daily, and methotrexate 17.5 mg by mouth weekly, with good control of her joint pain, swelling, and stiffness.    \n \nShe continues to have difficulty grasping objects with her right hand, dropping objects that are held in that hand.  She also experiences numbness in her right ring and little fingers.  She wears a neutral resting splint on her right wrist for symptoms that she ascribes to right carpal tunnel syndrome.  She has opted not to undergo surgical treatment of her right ulnar neuropathy, after consultation with Dr. Kyron M. Castaneda of the hand surgery service at OGH.  \n \nShe has experienced inadequate treatment of her pain on Darvocet-N 100 two tablets taken by mouth once daily.   \n\nShe has continued to tolerate methotrexate therapy without symptoms of significant toxicity.  She has not experienced skin rashes, fevers, chills, sores in her nose or mouth, hair loss, cough, shortness of breath, nausea, vomiting, or diarrhea.   \n\nShe has continued to tolerate prednisone therapy without adverse symptoms other than for fragility of her skin and easy bruisability.  \n \nShe experienced improvement in her lower back discomfort following an epidural corticosteroid injection to her lower back on Jun 02, 2109.  She is scheduled to receive another epidural corticosteroid injection to her lower back on September 09, 2109.   \n\nShe has some difficulty dressing herself, getting in and out of bed, lifting a full cup or glass to her mouth, washing and drying her entire body, bending down to pick up clothing from the floor, and turning regular faucets on and off.  She has much difficulty walking outdoors on flat ground and getting in and out of an automobile.  She is unable to walk two miles or participate in sports or games to her liking. (MDHAQ = 1.8)  She has much difficulty getting a good night's sleep and she has some difficulty dealing with feelings of anxiety and depression.   \n\nShe is stiff throughout the day and experiences severe pain and severe fatigue.  \n\nMedications\n\nTylenol (ACETAMINOPHEN) 500MG TABLET take 2 Tablet(s) PO BID \nFolic ACID 1MG TABLET take 1 Tablet(s) PO QD \nAsa (ACETYLSALICYLIC ACID) 81MG TABLET take 1 Tablet(s) PO QD \nMvi (MULTIVITAMINS) 1 CAPSULE PO QD \nCod LIVER OIL 1 TBSP PO BID \nCalcium + D (500 ELEM.

Morphine has caused nausea and projectile vomiting.  \n \nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Vital Signs  BP 148/60, P 64, RR 16, Temp 98.7 F, Wt 144 lb  Ms. Do was a very pleasant, cushingoid-appearing white woman in some distress due to pain.  Her skin was notable for ecchymoses on her extremities.  There was a healed skin graft on her left lower leg.  Well-healed scars were present over the lateral aspect of her right hip and over the anterior aspect of each knee.  There were no skin rashes.  Subcutaneous nodules, consistent with rheumatoid nodules, were present over the extensor surfaces of both elbows.  Her lungs were clear to auscultation.  Her cardiac examination revealed normal first and second heart sounds without murmurs or extra sounds.  Her musculoskeletal examination was notable for pain upon abduction and external rotation of her left shoulder.  There was ulnar deviation of the fingers of her right hand.  There was a boutonniere deformity of her left ring finger.  Bilateral hallux valgus deformities and cock-up toe deformities were present on both feet.  There was full painless motion of all small and large joints in both arms and legs without evidence of joint inflammation or of other significant joint deformity.  Her neurologic examination was notable for decreased sensation to light touch in the distribution of her right ulnar nerve, but was otherwise normal.  Her neurologic examination was normal with normal mental status, normal function of cranial nerves II through XII, normal muscle strength and tone in both arms and legs, intact sensation to light touch throughout, normal coordination, and symmetric deep tendon reflexes with downgoing plantar reflexes bilaterally. \n \nLABORATORY DATA:  I reviewed the laboratory data in the LMR with Ms. Do.  Studies performed at OGH on Jun 04, 2109, revealed ESR 19 mm/hr, CRP 10.6 mg/L, a benign urinalysis, ANA 1:80 with a speckled pattern of immunofluorescence, rheumatoid factor 165 IU/mL, and IgG anti-CCP antibodies 129 units.  \n\nIMPRESSION:  \n \n1.  Nodular, erosive rheumatoid arthritis since 2060, without evidence of synovitis on prednisone 5 mg p.o. b.i.d., Celebrex 200 mg p.o. b.i.d., and methotrexate 17.5 mg p.o. weekly.  She continues to be most limited by her right hand dysfunction and right ulnar neuropathy, but has opted to treat this conservatively.  \n \n2.  Low back pain, treated with epidural corticosteroid injection on Jun 02, 2109.  \n \n3.  Type II noninsulin-dependent diabetes mellitus.\n\n4.  Vascular insufficiency in her legs.\n\n5.  Peripheral neuropathy.\n\n6.  Hearing loss in her left ear.\n\n7.  Right total hip arthroplasty surgery in 2070.\n\n8.  Right total knee arthroplasty surgery in 2081.\n\n10. Left total knee arthroplasty surgery in 2082.\n\n11. Lumbar fusion performed in 2098 and again in 2099.\n\n12. Sigmoid colonic resection in 2103.\n\n13. Cellulitis and osteomyelitis involving her right foot in October 2104.\n\n14. Cataract extracted from her right eye in 2102.\n\n15. Cataract extracted from her left eye in 2103.\n\n16. Transient ischemic attack in June 2106.\n\n17. Cellulitis involving her legs in 2107.  \n\nRECOMMENDATIONS:  I discussed my impressions with Ms. Do.  I suggested that she increase her frequency of Darvocet-N 100 dosing to 2 tablets taken by mouth every 6 hours, as needed for pain control.  She will withhold a Tylenol dose, when she takes Darvocet N-100.  She will continue taking her other medications at their present doses.  \n \nLaboratory studies will be performed today to assess her CBC, WBC differential count, plasma creatinine, ALT, AST, serum albumin, ESR, and CRP.  \n \nMs. Do will return to see me on December 11, 2109, at 9:40 a.m., so that I may assess her response to continued treatment and make any necessary changes in therapy. \n\n\n_____________________________________________\nTibor Oquinn, M.D.\n\ncc:  \n\nOrelia D.

Webber, M.D.\nRecord date: 2079-12-12\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHarper Hospital Physician Group\n\n787 Everett Street\nLake Pocotopaug, ME  15424\n\n281-223-9046\n\n\n\nAARON, JEAN\n\n42817774\n\n12/12/2079\n\n\n\nHISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  A 65-year-old female who presents today for hospital followup.\n\n\n\nI admitted her to the HH on 10/03/79 with an episode of hypoxemia, which was felt to be secondary to CHF and diastolic dysfunction.  She was discharged to johnson rest home on 10/12/79.  Two hours after arrival, she had a respiratory arrest and was taken to the Intensive Care Unit at Clinica Rovira where she stayed until 11/03/79.  She is extremely difficult to diurese because of her tenuous renal function, this required multiple adjustments of her medication.  Stress test showed no ischemia and echocardiogram showed concentric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal chamber size and systolic function, estimated ejection fraction is 65% as well as biatrial enlargement .  She did well acutely with BiPAP and remains on oxygen.  As part of her workup, she had pulmonary function tests, which showed moderate obstruction without a bronchodilator response and some mild restriction likely due to her obesity.  In addition, she was quite anemic with hematocrit of 19 on presentation.  There was no evidence of hemolysis.  She is mildly iron deficient and colonoscopy showed a tubulovillous adenoma, which was excised as well as  a short area of Barrett's esophagus.  There was no evidence of active bleeding.  She received multiple transfusions throughout her stay and was started on darbepoetin, for what was ultimately felt to be anemia of renal disease.  She was discharged to Lahey Clinic and has just returned home.  Her son, Brendon Ambrose who was the healthcare proxy, is here with her today.\n\n\n\nToday, she feels reasonably well.  She is still somewhat weak from the prolonged hospitalization, but is quite enthusiastic about the fact that she lost 30 pounds.  She is taking her medications regularly and remains on 2 liters of oxygen.  She has no chest pain or shortness of breath.  Her diabetes regimen was changed during the hospital, she is still taking 70/30 insulin, but lower dose in the evenings and using a sliding scale of lispro insulin with meals.\n\n\n\nHospital course was complicated by a hospital-acquired pneumonia and urinary tract infection as well.  \n\n\n\nPAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Congestive heart failure secondary to diastolic dysfunction, type 2 diabetes, renal insufficiency with baseline creatinine approximately 3, hyperlipidemia, atrial fibrillation, peripheral vascular disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, peripheral neuropathy, Barrett's esophagus, colon polyps (tubulovillous adenoma 2079), diverticulosis adenoid hypertrophy, humeral fracture, history of marijuana use, history of alcohol abuse.\n\n\n\nMEDICATIONS:  Reconciled today, they include:\n\n1.  Aspirin 81 mg daily.\n\n2.  Calcium plus D 1 tablet b.i.d.\n\n3.  Darbepoetin is followed by Dr. Dougherty at St. Mary's.\n\n4.  Iron sulfate 325 mg b.i.d.\n\n5.  Hydralazine 100 mg t.i.d.\n\n6.  Loratadine 10 mg daily.\n\n7.  Metolazone 100 mg daily.\n\n8.  Metoprolol succinate 150 mg daily.\n\n9.  Multivitamin.\n\n10.  Nitroglycerin patch 0.3 mg per hour (3 x 0.1 mg patches).\n\n11.  70/30 NovoLog 60 units in the morning and 35 in the evening.\n\n12.  Omeprazole 20 mg b.i.d.\n\n13.  Potassium chloride 40 mEq t.i.d.\n\n14.  Ropinirole 0.25 mg daily.\n\n15.  Simvastatin 40 mg daily.\n\n16.  Spiriva 1 inhalation daily.\n\n17.  Spironolactone 50 mg daily.\n\n18.  Torsemide 100 mg b.i.d.\n\n19.  Trazodone 25 mg nightly.\n\n20.  B-complex vitamin daily.\n\n21.  Vitamin D3 1000 units daily.\n\n22.  Coumadin as monitored by the Hematology Dept..\n\n\n\nALLERGIES TO MEDICATIONS:  None.\n\n\n\nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Blood pressure is 136/60, pulse 74, temperature 97, and weight 222 pounds.  General appearance:  She looks remarkably well given everything she has gone through.  HEENT is unremarkable.  Neck is supple.  No lymphadenopathy, no JVD.  Lungs are clear.  Heart irregularly irregular without murmurs.  Abdomen is soft, nontender, without organomegaly.  Extremities without edema.\n\n\n\nLABORATORIES:  Drawn by the VNA on 01/04/80 shows hematocrit of 28.6, INR 2.1 on December 9, 2079 as well as potassium 3.9 and creatinine 3.2.\n\n\n\nIMPRESSION AND PLAN:\n\n1.  Congestive heart failure, diastolic dysfunction.  She is currently euvolemic with a weight of 222 pounds.  She will check daily weights.  I will speak to Dr. Vandiver, her cardiologist whom she is seeing next week about getting her enrolled in the HH Cardiac Rehab Center.  Meanwhile, she will call me for any fluctuations in weight.\n\n2.  Atrial fibrillation, stable and rate controlled.  Coumadin anticoagulation followed by the HH Hematology Department.\n\n3.  COPD, for now, she remains on Spiriva and Flovent as well as oxygen 2 liters per minute.  We will see how she does; she may benefit from a trial of Advair.\n\n4.  Chronic renal insufficiency.  Creatinine at baseline of 3.2.  She will need to be watched closely.  She expressed interest in possibility of her renal transplant should that become necessary.  There has been a question as to whether she has renal artery stenosis based on a Doppler ultrasound done during rehabilitation.  I think this must have been done at Brookwood Hospital because no studies are available in the HH system.  Dr. Dougherty had done MRA a number of years ago, which showed no renal artery stenosis at that time, but her worsening renal function is new.  She is scheduled to see Dr. Dougherty next week and will follow up with her expressly raising this issue.  Her son brought up the issue of perhaps consolidating all her care at the HH ,in particular is seeing a nephrologist here.  She is quite fond of Dr. Dougherty who has cared for her for years, but I think given the complexity of medical care.  this might not be a bad idea.  She is going to discuss with Dr. Dougherty and I will E-mail Dr. Dougherty as well.\n\n5.  GI.  She was noted to have Barrett's esophagus and tubulovillous adenoma on exam and she will need to have followup within 1 year for this.\n\n6.  Heme.  Her anemia is a combination of iron deficiency and anemia of renal disease.  She needed several transfusions during the hospitalization.  She is scheduled to see Hematology at Stone-Wheeling in January.  In the meantime,  I have spoken to Dr. Dougherty who agrees to monitor her in the Renal Department at St. Mary's.  If necessary, they can give her intravenous iron.  I will check a hematocrit and iron stores today and fax them over to Dr. Dougherty.\n\n7.  Health care maintenance.  Labs today.  H1N1 vaccine today.  Son, Brendon Ambrose is her healthcare proxy and I have put his name in the Advanced directive file on the LMR.  She wishes to be full code at present.  I will see her again in 4 weeks.\n\n\n\nVisit length 60 minutes.\n\n\n\n\n\n______________________________\n\nWendy P Nowak, M.D.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\neScription document:2-22566361 CSSten Tel\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDD: 12/12/79\n\nDT: 12/12/79\n\nDV: 12/12/79"}

Surgery has debrided the wound, sending wound cultures as well as blood cultures. Acute OM would not be visible on XR changes and clinical picture is more consistent with acute than Chronic OM. Will consider further work up for OM if symptoms do not respond to treatment. Levo and flagyl were added to unasyn in accord to previous culture data.\n\n2.\tPVD: Will need arterial LENIS to assess for vascular patency and flow.

Per his wife, in April he described left hand weakness. He stopped smoking at the time and stated that his deficit resolved. He was in his usual state of health until this evening. He last noted feeling normal after the Coyotes game, which ended at about 7:30PM. He subsequently took a nap, per his routine, and awoke at 11:00PM to ready himself for his night shift as an RN. He took a shower and noted weakness in his right arm during the shower. After, while trying to put his clothes on, he developed progressive weakness such that his arm became plegic and he was no longer able to stand. EMS was phoned and the pt arrived at the GBH ED around 11:40PM. NIH stroke scale = 12 .

Head CT showed hypodensity in the R MCA territory, and CTA revealed R ICA occlusion.  The patient was admitted to the neuroICU.  Follow-up head CT the morning after admission revealed hypodensity involving the entire R MCA territory.  Because of malignant swelling, he went on to require hemicraniectomy which was performed by the Simmons Neurosurgery service.  He recovered and was discharged to rehab on 10/28 with left hemiplegia and dense left-sided neglect.  Aspirin was prescribed for stroke prophylaxis but was subsequently stopped at rehab for unclear reasons.\n\n\n\nHis stroke work-up revealed a normal echocardiogram and 24-hr Holter monitor.  A hypercoagulability panel was negative.  Homocysteine was normal.  Serum lipid analysis revealed mild hypertriglyceridemia.\n\n\n\nThe patient was re-admitted on 12/02 with an abdominal bone flap infection.  The flap was removed and long-term antibiotics prescribed.  He did well and then was re-admitted 01/01 with fever, headache, nausea, and vomiting.  His hemicraniectomy site revealed protruding brain which required revision in the OR.  Long-term antibiotics were again prescribed for possible infection of the site.  The patient did well, but routine follow-up MRI of the cranium on 3/8 shows a large, rim-enhancing, DWI bright fluid collection adjacent to the hemicraniectomy site.  This may represent abscess.  Dr. Bennett, Simmons Neurosurgery attending, intends to admit Mr. Rico 3/27 for fluid sampling and culture.  Additional operative intervention may be indicated if this fluid collection is indeed infected.  Patient denies fever or chills.  He has had headaches frequently during the past couple of weeks.  This was a major problem early in his course but then resolved.\n\n\n\nMr. Rico has now been out of rehab for 2 months, and he is doing quite well.  He is able to walk with the assistance of a four-post cane.  His appetite is good, and he sleeps well on trazodone.  He has a very close family who is intimately involved in his medical care.  His spirits have been good considering the ordeal he has recently been through.  While in rehab, his wife apparently deserted him after accruing a great deal of credit card debt from gambling.  He cries when he tells me about this.  A close female friend has moved in to his home and cares for him 24 hours a day.  He is able to assist with ADLs but cannot function independently.  His left leg has some strength, but his arm remains completely paralyzed.  There are occasional twitches in the thumb that are not voluntary.\n\n\n\nHe has had a great deal of left shoulder pain related to subluxation at that joint.  An orthopedist suggested that the family consider shoulder fusion at some point in the future when the patient has recovered maximal function in the arm.  He also has occasional hip pain on the same side that is less bothersome.  Neurontin has been helpful for the shoulder pain, though the family believes that higher doses lead to a depressed mood.  They are trying to decrease the amount of Dilaudid he uses. \n\n\n\nPMHx:\n\n-stroke as above\n\n-HTN\n\n-hyperlipidemia\n\n-DM\n\n\n\nMeds:\n\n-Zestril 5\n\n-trazodone 150\n\n-Avandia 4\n\n-Glucophage 1000 bid\n\n-insulin\n\n-Neurontin 400 bid\n\n-Zantac\n\n-Lopressor 50 bid\n\n-Dilaudid 2 tid\n\n-Lidoderm patch to L shoulder\n\n-Pravachol 20\n\n-Paxil 20\n\n-folate, B vitamins\n\n\n\nAll:  Allegra -> unknown reaction\n\n\n\nSoHx:  Lives with daughter and female friend.

Potentially infected fluid collection at site of hemicraniectomy.  No evidence of systemic infection.  Subluxation of L shoulder.\n\n1.  Admit for neurosurgical management as discussed.  Bone prosthesis will be placed at some point in the future (when possibility of infection is definitively ruled out or treated).\n\n2.  Should be on aspirin for stroke/MI prophylaxis, but will discuss with Dr. Bennett before starting.\n\n3.  Continue aggressive BP/lipid management.\n\n4.  For neuropathic pain in the shoulder, will try Elavil 25 qhs.  Patient will stop trazodone.  If Elavil is helpful, may increase to 50 qhs after one week of therapy.  Once Elavil up to 50 qhs, would slowly taper Neurontin as per patient and family preference.  At next appointment, if persistent left arm paralysis (which is likely), will encourage surgical fusion of the shoulder.\n\n5.  Follow-up in 3 months.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n__________________________\n\nLeroy Kelly, M.D.\nRecord date: 2070-11-07\n\n      \n\n \n\n\n\nEitel HospitalIntern Admission Note\n\n\t\n\n\n\nCC  mental status change, n/v\n\n\n\nHPI \n\nSource: caregivers.

This occurred in the setting of right internal carotid artery occlusion, and hemicraniectomy was required for management of malignant cerebral edema after the stroke.  He subsequently developed an infection of the abdominal bone flap.  His stroke workup revealed a normal echocardiogram and 24-hour Holter monitor.  A hypercoagulability panel was negative.  Homocysteine was normal.  Serum lipid analysis revealed mild hypertriglyceridemia.  His recovery was complicated by brain abscess, which required surgical drainage and prolonged antibiotic therapy.  Finally an artificial bone flap was replaced in October 2070.  He then developed persistent nausea and vomiting and a pseudomeningocele.  A VP shunt was placed by Dr. Bennett.  Unfortunately, even after shunting there was persistent nausea and vomiting.  This turned out to be a side effect of Fentanyl patch use.  The Fentanyl was subsequently replaced with methadone for chronic left-sided neuropathic pain, and the nausea and vomiting abated.\n\n\n\nI last saw Nathan on April 2nd of this year at which point he was doing quite well.  He complained of some hot flashes of unclear etiology.  His depression seemed to be under better control on Celexa. \n\n\n\nToday he reports that he continues to have trouble with neuropathic pain on the left side of his body.  Fortunately he has managed to wean himself off of methadone and this has not caused the pain to get any worse.  He is using a substantial dose of Neurontin, which he thinks is helpful.  He complains that these pains involve his face, arm, and leg on the left side and he wonders whether there might be some relationship between the pain and the shunt, which was placed on the left side of his head.  He also complains of occasional leg spasms at night, which are not particularly bothersome.  His most significant complaint at this time relates to the hot flashes that he mentioned at our last visit.  These often occur several times daily, although they may not occur for several days at a time.  He explains that most of the episodes occur when he is in bed at night.  He first develops a feeling of nausea followed by a cold sensation on one side of his body or the other.  This has been followed by a feeling of heat from the top of his head down to his toes.  There may be a feeling of urinary urgency.  He then experiences a sensation as if he is floating on the bed, and generally this is followed by nausea.  The entire episode lasts only seconds but the nausea may persist for as long as an hour.  He also notes on some mornings he does not feel like getting out of bed.  He continues to experience depressed mood, and he longs to return to a normal state of functioning.  \n\n\n\nHe has returned to volunteering as a Big Brother.  He is unable to work.  His divorce is now complete and he is really glad about this.  He is living with a friend named Tejeda who takes excellent care of him.  \n\n\n\nHis left arm remains paralyzed.  He has minimal proximal strength in his leg.  He has a dense visual field deficit on the left side.  \n\n\n\nHe has one new complaint which is a feeling of numbness and tingling in the 4th and 5th fingers on the right side.  \n\n\n\nPAST MEDICAL HISTORY include diabetes, hypertension, and hyperlipidemia.  \n\n\n\nCURRENT MEDICATIONS include Celexa 20 mg daily, Neurontin 600 mg q.i.d., Phenergan p.r.n., Avandia, Glucophage, Lopressor, Zestril, Pravachol, insulin, and aspirin 325 mg daily.  \n\n\n\nOn exam Nathan is well-appearing.  His hair has now grown back.  On mental status exam he is able to relate a cogent history.  He has a number of questions about stroke rehabilitation possibilities including a hyperbaric oxygen program that he learned about in Connecticut.  Eye contact is good.  On cranial nerve exam pupils are round and reactive and extraocular movements are intact.  There is a left visual field deficit.  The face is asymmetric with an upper motor neuron pattern left facial droop.  The tongue protrudes in the midline.  The left arm is completely plegic.  The left leg has greater than anti-gravity proximal strength.  There is left-sided sensory extinction.  Reflexes are brisk on the left and normal on the right.  Nathan is able to ambulate with a cane and a left ankle foot orthosis.  \n\n\n\nWe spent much of today's visit discussing various issues that concern Nathan.  Regarding the possibility of hyperbaric oxygen therapy for stroke rehabilitation.  I explained that there is no convincing evidence in favor of this approach.  There are some risks to hyperbaric oxygen therapy such as lung injury and the programs are extremely costly.  Therefore I advised Nathan not to pursue that option.\n\n\n\nRegarding his frequent hot flashes, which are very bothersome, the etiology of these episodes is quite unclear.  Dr. Mays mentioned the possibility that these episodes represent some sort of diencephalic paroxysmal discharges.  I think it is possible that these are a side effect of Celexa; I believe that they first occurred shortly after starting Celexa.  We decided to stop the Celexa for a 2-week period to see if there is any improvement in the episodes.  If there is, I would consider changing to an antidepressant that works by a different mechanism.  If there is no change in the episodes we can go ahead and add Celexa back.  \n\n\n\nI neglected to mention above that there is sensory loss to temperature and pinprick in the right hand involving the 4th and 5th digits and the ulnar aspect of the hand on the palmar surface.  There is no motor dysfunction in the hand.  There is no Tinel's sign over the ulnar nerve at the elbow.  The ulnar nerve in the ulnar groove is not hypermobile.  The symptoms and physical exam are consistent with ulnar entrapment neuropathy, which I suspect is the result of arm flexion during sleep.  I suggested that Nathan buy an elbow pad with a Velcro strap that will help facilitate keeping the arm straight during sleep.  We will keep an eye on this over time.  \n\n\n\nNo other changes are indicated at the moment.  I intend to see Nathan in followup in about 6 months.\n\n\n\n\n\n___________________________\n\nLeroy Kelly, M.D.\n\n\n\ncc:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTD: 11/26/2071 12:12:15\n\nTR: quijada\n\nJob ID:  568143"}

According to the patient, she had high blood pressure for years that was well controlled according to her up till Jan, when she lost her insurance and could not fill in her prescriptions. In Jan of this year, the patient stopped taking any BP meds up till she had a visit with her Psych nurse which found her BP to be in the 200s sent her to EW, they controlled her BP and sent her out on Metoprolol 50 BID, and Lisinopril 10 mg QD. After which, the patient had a trip to Peru and ran out of her medication 2 days priory to her return. When she returned about a wk ago the patient presented to EW because of another episode of hypertensive  emergency, for which, she was D/C with a follow up with one of the HGH PCPs. Patient could not get an appointment until later this month, and she was having a feeling of fatigue today, so she called her APS nurse which one more time found her to be in the 200s and sent her to the EW. \n\n\nOn ROS:  Patient denies any HA, changes in vision, nausia, vomiting, chest pain, palpitation, SOB, Abd pain, syncope, palpitation, recent wt changes, change in her bowel or urinary habits. However she does describe feeling fatigued, episodes of flushing, history of hearing double messages when she communicate with other people.  No feeling of hot or cold. \n\n\nEmergency room course:  \nIn the EW, the BP was 210/109, P: 90, RR:18, SAO2 100%. The patient received 5mg of lopressor IV and and 50mg PO for which her BP had minimal response. She also received 20 mg of IV Labetalol then 200mg PO' after which her blood pressure was down to the 180s, then it started climbing back up to the 200s for which she received another 10 mg IV, the highest reading the patient got was 257/188. The patient was also given a 325 mg ASA, and the first 2 cardiac enzymes were negative.

Goal is around 160-170. Will start Nicardipine PO 20mg TID and Labetolol 300mg PO and titrate up to BP goal.   to maintain goal \n2-       Hypkalemia/fatigue/hypertension: worried about secondary casues of HTN, namely hyperaldo state or liddel syndrom. Will check an 8am ambulating PAC to PRA ratio, will also check a spot urine to plasma K. Will check serum Metanephrine for pheo, and 24 hrs urine for cortisol, lytes, VMA, metanephrines to check for cushings and pheochromoctoma.  Will get a MRA to evaluate for renal artery stenosis. \n2-       Mood disorder: no active hallucination, will continue with Seroquel.\n3-       DM: insulin sliding scale, QID finger sticks.\n4-       UTI: urine with WBC, ? starting Bactrim DS X3 days. \n5-       Prophy:  Fragmin SC. \n\n\n\n\nXavier Aaron Lowe M.D.  75059\nName,    Pager   #\nRecord date: 2066-10-14\n\nHPI; pt was seen at her pulmonary specialist yesterday &amp; noted to have high BP 188/100.

She says it was like she was a drunk.  She hadn't been drinking and hadn't taken or eaten anything unusual.  She was very scared.  No visual changes or other unusual sensations.  She hadn't been sick in any other way:  no fevers, chills, N/V, or other complaints.\n \nShe felt a tiny bit better and was able to go to the door and let the EMTs in.  They checked her sugar:  63.  They gave her some sugar gel and her Sx resolved.\n \nIn the ER, her Sx did not reappear.  Labs were notable for BS of 140 then 255.  (A1C on 12/27/66 was 7.8.)  Her Na+ was low @ 124 &amp; 126, but this is stable for her.    She had a normal MRI/MRA.\n \nSince then, she has felt her usual self.

Patient states over the past 2 days she has felt confused and weak, citing that when someone would call she was unable to speak.  She also has felt unsteady on her feet and fell twice yesterday when out walking, hitting her face and arm.  She reports dizziness prior to fall but denies chest pain, palpitations or SOB.  There was no loss of consciousness and she was able to get up/ambulate after fall.  Of note, she has switched from drinking 7 cans of diet coke per day to 7 cans of regular coke because the facility where she lives ran out of diet coke.  She is also restricting her caloric intake and her meals consist of a croissant at breakfast, cottage cheese at lunch and an avocado for dinner, in attempt to lose weight.   She has not had any recent medication changes.  She denies recent fever, chills, CP, headache, abdominal pain, diarrhea, dysuria.  She does report significant thirst and frequent urination.  She also reports SOB with exertion, particularly walking up stairs.    \n\n  \n\nIn the ED initial VS were T 99.2  HR 98  BP 173/93  RR 22.  Labs were significant for a Na 118, K 3.5, Cl 82, CO2 17.5, AG 19, WBC 15, Hct 32.  CXR was clear.  She was given a total of 1L NS and free water restricted.

Rate 106.  Q waves in II, III, aVF, V3.  Slightly changed from prior.\n\n\n\n                \n\nASSESSMENT AND PLAN\n\nMs. Ostrander is a 64 yo Peruvian woman with schizophrenia, HTN, DM2, HL presenting with confusion and found to have significant metabolic disarray including hyponatremia, hypokalemia, hypochloremia and an anion gap.  She also has a mild leukocytosis, anemia &#8211; at baseline, and thrombocytosis.  \n\n\n\n##: Hyponatremia &#8211; Calculated serum osmolality is 248 mOsm/L (measured 241) suggesting a hypotonic hyponatremia.  Clinically she appears euvolemic, despite having a dry mouth which may be from patient&#8217;s antipsychotics.   A Uosm of 62 is most suggestive of primary polydipsia vs. low solute.  Patient is drinking 2L coke/day and complaining of excessive thirst, per PCP/psych notes she is told to limit fluids to 1L.  Interestingly this may have been precipitated by switching from diet coke to coke as diet coke contains 30mg Na and 0gm carbs while regular coke contains 45mg Na and 39gm carbohydrates.  Increased carbohydrates with little sodium, protein or potassium load (such as in beer potomania) can inhibit protein breakdown and urea excretion, therefore decreasing daily solute excretion to &lt;250mOsm, which can result in hypoNa if fluid intake is increased.\n\n\nCorrect at a rate of &lt;0.5mEq/L/h since she is no longer symptomatic\n\nQ6H lytes to ensure correct rate of correction &#8211; prevent osmotic demyelination\n\nFluid restrict to 1L fluid/day\n\nSince she is euvolemic, no indication for NS repletion\n\nPatient refused nutrition consult to discuss dietary choices &#8211; clearly she is making poor dietary choices and her caloric intake is ~800-1000 kcal/day currently from food (+~1000kcal from soda)\n\n\n\n##: Protected fall &#8211; History is suggestive of fall in setting of electrolyte distribution and consequential lightheadedness.   Does not seem cardiac in origin, however Q waves in inferior leads appear to have progressed from last EKG on 2/20/67.  Protected fall argues against acute arrhythmic event.\n\n\nCheck orthostatics\n\nWill check cardiac enzymes as EKG is suggestive of progressive Q waves in inferior leads.\n\nMonitor on telemetry.\n\nPhysical therapy consult.\n\n\n\n##: Anemia &#8211; Hct at baseline, however was iron deficit in 6/65 and had a tubular adenoma resection on colo.  Will repeat iron studies to ensure iron replete.  \n\n\nFe, TIBC, ferritin\n\nConsider repeat outpt colonoscopy to r/o GI malignancy/lesion contributing to anemia\n\n\n\n##: Elevated anion gap.  Delta-delta is 8/6=1.3= Pure metabolic acidosis.  Osmolar gap is &lt;10 so ingestion is less likely.  There are no ketones in the UA and there is no evidence of renal failure.  pH is not suggestive of an acidosis.  AG is likely from severe metabolic disarray (decreased anions and cations).\n\n\nCheck lactate\n\nRepeat AG\n\n\n\n##: Leukocytosis - no evidence of infection, although infection could contribute to confusion.  UA and CXR were negative.  If persistent or febrile will obtain cultures.  Repeat CBC\n\n\n##: Diabetes &#8211; continue metformin, glyburide\n\n\nFinger sticks AC with RISS\n\n\n\n##: Schizophrenia &#8211; continue trilafon\n\n##: Insomnia &#8211; continue seroquel, ambient\n\n##: Hypertension &#8211; continue avapro, labetalol, norvasc, spironolactone, aspirin\n\n##: Hyperlipidemia &#8211; continue simvastatin\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFEN: 1L fluid restriction, no caffeine.
