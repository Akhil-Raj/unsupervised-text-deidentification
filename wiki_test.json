I have not seen him since November. \nAbout three weeks ago he stopped his Prednisone on his own because\nhe was gaining weight.  He does feel that his shoulders are\ndefinitely improved.  It is unclear what he is actually taking, but\nI think based on the color of his pills and the timing of the\nmedication that he continues taking his Atenolol for hypertension\nand 1 Hydroxychloroquine tablet.  He is concerned because of the\nrelatively recent onset of difficulties turning his head to the\nright.  When he does this, he will note that he feels as though he\nis going to pass out although this has not actually happened.  This\nonly occurs when he turns to the right and not to the left.  He has\nno visual changes otherwise and denies any headache or other\ncranial complaints.  \n \nOn examination today, BP 120/80.  He has no bruits over the\ncarotid.  He has no tenderness in this region either.  He has good\nperipheral pulses at the arms.  His joint examination is much\nimproved with better ROM of the shoulders and no peripheral joint\nsynovitis.  \n \nClinical Impression:\n \n#1:  Inflammatory arthritis - possibly RA - with response noted to\nHydroxychloroquine along with Prednisone.  He has stopped the\nPrednisone, and I would not restart it yet.  \n \n#2:  New onset of symptoms suspicious for right-sided carotid\ndisease.  Will arrange for carotid ultrasound studies.  Patient\nadvised to call me if he develops any worsening symptoms.  He has\nbeen taking 1 aspirin per day prophylaxis long-term, and I stressed\nthat he continue to do so.

He presents with pain over the lower part of his chest since Monday-- came on when he was in bed. The pain is located in a specific spot over his breast bone, and is present all the time, worse with coughing, sneezing, or sudden deep breath. No change with exertion-- did his usual exercises (stretching, leg lifts, crunching) yesterday without a problem. No variation with food. No change with position (e.g., leaning forward). Denies productive cough, fever, chills, nausea, diaphoresis, palpitations. No radiation to the jaw or arm. The pain does not remind him of his sx prior to CABG (which he says was exertional SOB), but does feel like his incisional pain after the surgery (which eventually went away completely).\n\n \n\nROS as above, otherwise negative in detail. He says his pain is currently gone, and he feels fine lying back in the exam room.\n\n\n\n\n\nProblems\n\n      Coronary artery disease    : s/p CABG x 4 in 3/80\n\n      SERONEGATIVE RA\n\n      HYPERTENSION\n\n      ?CARPAL TUNNEL SYNDROME\n\n      ?RT CAROTID DISEASE\n\n      obesity\n\n      hyperlipidemia\n\n      Diabetes mellitus type 2\n\n\n\nMedications\n\n      AMIODARONE   200 MG (200MG TABLET take 1) PO QD \n\n      Aspirin (ACETYLSALICYLIC Acid)   325MG TABLET  PO QD x 30 days\n\n      ATENOLOL   50 MG (50MG TABLET take 1) PO QD \n\n      Enalapril Maleate   10 MG (10MG TABLET take 1) PO QD x 30 days\n\n      Hctz (HYDROCHLOROTHIAZIDE)   25MG TABLET take 1 Tablet(s) PO QD \n\n      Lipitor (ATORVASTATIN)   80 MG (80MG TABLET take 1) PO QHS \n\n      METFORMIN   850 MG (850MG TABLET take 1) PO BID \n\n      Viagra (SILDENAFIL)   100MG TABLET take 0.5 Tablet(s) PO x1 \n\n      Vicodin Es 7.5/750 (HYDROCODONE 7.5mg + Apap 750mg)   1 TAB PO BID PRN  , Mailing hard copy to you.\n\n      Xanax (ALPRAZOLAM)   0.5MG TABLET take 1 Tablet(s) PO BID \n\n\n\nAllergies\n\n      NKA\n\n\n\nVital Signs\n\n      PULSE   66 \n\n      TEMPERATURE   98.7 F\n\n      O2 SAT   97 \n\n      BLOOD PRESSURE   135/60 \n\nRight arm.\n\n      BLOOD PRESSURE   132/60 \n\nL arm.\n\n\n\nPhysical Exam\n\n      General Appearance\n\nAlert, no acute distress, comfortable lying flat on exam table.\n\n      HEENT\n\nPERRL.\n\nMoist mucous membranes.\n\n\n\n      Neck\n\nNo visible JVD.\n\nNo cervical nodes.\n\n\n\n      Chest\n\nLungs clear, good air movement, no crackles, wheezes.

Sx are different from his original anginal pain-- and I suspect he has some sort of focal inflammation / contusion over the lower part of the sternotomy site. No sign, currently, of local or systemic infection. Doubt pneumonia (no cough or fever, lungs clear) or GI cause. Pericarditis a possibility (he had post-op pericarditis after his CABG), but no signs on ECG, and the pain is not positional.\n\n \n\nDiscussed the case with the pt's cardiologist, Dr. Xavier Rush-- and we came up with the following plan:\n\n\n\n\n\nPlan\n\n- will send CK/MB/Tn x 1-- although cards agrees that likelihood that this is cardiac seems low\n\n- check CXR\n\n- send ESR, CBC/Diff\n\n- OK for pt to go home after labs drawn and CXR done\n\n- will contact Dr. Thorne's service (cardiac surgery) and Dr. Perez (PCP) to make them aware\n\n- instructed pt to go to the ED immediately for increased pain, SOB, fever, or swelling/redness over the lower sternum\n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n______________________________\n\nOwen M Gallagher, M.D."}

He is four weeks \n\nstatus post revision of an aorto-bifemoral bypass graft, which got \n\ninfected and had to be revised.  He has been doing well, but now \n\npresents here with a low-grade fever to 100.9 degrees F. (he states \n\nhis maximum temperature at home was 101 degrees F., while he was \n\ntaking Advil for the fever).  He presents for evaluation.  He has \n\nhad no drainage from the site, and has been home on IV Nafcillin \n\nfor the past two months secondary to his graft infection. \n\nPAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  As above. \n\nMEDICATIONS:  IV Nafcillin, Lasix, Zocor, and insulin. \n\nALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies. \n\nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  The vital signs include a blood pressure of \n\n179/85, a pulse of 91, respirations of 20, and a fever to 100.9 \n\ndegrees F.  The HEENT examination is normal.  There are some \n\ncrackles at the left base, but the lungs are otherwise normal.  The \n\nheart has a regular rate and rhythm.  The abdomen is soft and \n\nnon-tender, with good bowel sounds.  There is a right groin mass, \n\nquestionably a hematoma, with good pulses however.  The extremities \n\nare well-perfused. \n\nLABORATORY EVALUATION:  The electrolytes, BUN, and creatinine are \n\nnormal.  The blood sugar is 180.  The white count is normal at 3.7. \n\nThe hematocrit is 29.  The PT/PTT are pending.  The urinalysis is \n\nnegative so far, with microscopic pending. \n\nTHERAPY RENDERED/COURSE IN ED:  The patient was seen by Surgery. \n\nThe consensus was to order a CT scan of the abdomen, since the \n\npatient had a fever at that point, and so the CT scan is pending. \n\nThus, the assessment was that this was a 58-year-old male with a \n\nhistory of a recent revision of an aorto-bifemoral bypass graft, \n\nwho had been on two months of IV Nafcillin, and who presented with \n\na fever.  Laboratory studies are done and cultures sent.  A Surgery \n\nconsultation and abdominal CT scan were ordered, and results were \n\npending.  The patient was admitted to the Emergency Department \n\nObservation Unit awaiting the scan, full evaluation, and \n\ndisposition.  The patient was signed out to the 3 p.m. attending. \n\nCONSULTATIONS (INCLUDING PCP):  Surgery. \n\nFINAL DIAGNOSIS:  Fever. \n\nDISPOSITION (including condition upon discharge):  The patient is \n\nadmitted to the Emergency Department Observation Unit in stable \n\ncondition. \n\n___________________________________                    VF918/05141\n\nPERRY UPSHAW, M.D.       PU38                           D:08/26/83 \n\n                                                       T:08/27/83 \n\nDictated by:  PERRY UPSHAW, M.D.       PU38 \n\n ******** Not reviewed by Attending Physician ********\nRecord date: 2086-12-08\n\n\nSilver Ridge Internal Medicine\n3 Eaton Place                                      OROZCO, KYLE\nMansfield, NV 29473                                      56040785\n-----------                                           12/08/86\n\n\nINTERVAL HISTORY:  The patient is status post one lumbar epidural\ninjection.

The patient \nreported that he was stuck in traffic for about 12 hours last night \nand apparently got very tense.  He felt some heat from his car, \nthought that it was overheating, and then developed some chest pain \nand throat tightness.  He really described what seems to be \nfleeting chest tightness and no diaphoresis, no shortness of \nbreath, and no arm numbness or tingling.  However, he did have one \nassociated symptom of some throat tightness. \nPAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  The patient has had a stress test one year \nago that was normal.  He had an echocardiogram at that time that \nwas also normal. \nMEDICATIONS:  Claritin, Proventil, and cimetidine. \nALLERGIES:  Morphine sulfate. \nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  VITAL SIGNS:  The patient is afebrile. \nVital signs are normal.  HEENT:  Normal.  NECK:  Supple.  LUNGS: \nClear bilaterally.  CARDIAC:  Regular rate and rhythm without \nmurmur.  ABDOMEN:  Soft and non-tender.  EXTREMITIES:  Negative. \nNo CVA tenderness. \nLABORATORY EVALUATION:  EKG shows normal sinus rhythm.  There is no \nchange in his electrocardiogram.  Chest x-ray is clear.  CK is 155. \nTroponin is 0.13.  Electrolytes are normal.  BUN and creatinine are \n20 and 1.0.  Hematocrit is 39, white count normal. \nTHERAPY RENDERED/COURSE IN ED:  The patient is a 46 year old male \nwith a fleeting episode of chest pain and throat tightness while \nstuck in traffic.  He was seen at Southwest Texas Medical Center and \nthen sent here appearing somewhat anxious, with a normal physical \nexamination, normal EKG, normal chest x-ray, and normal metabolic \npanel.  Most likely low probability for ischemia.  Risk factors are \nalso very low. \nDISPOSITION (including condition upon discharge):   The patient is \ngoing to be admitted to the Short Stay Unit for a rule out MI \nprotocol and possibly for another ETT. \n___________________________________                    NE270/9072\nVICTOR T.

As you know, he is a 53-year-old gentleman who underwent implantation of a permanent pacemaker on 02/11/60 for presyncope and pauses on Holter monitoring.  His past medical history is significant for hyperlipidemia, gastroesophageal reflux disease, and asthma.  Prior to his pacemaker placement, an exercise stress test was performed because of his history of exertional chest pain.  He was able to exercise for 8 minutes and 4 seconds.  The test was terminated for 7/10 substernal chest pain, but no hypotension and no overt EKG changes were noted, so we proceeded with the pacemaker implant.  Since the implant Mr. Hess describes that his intermittent symptoms of lightheadedness and shortness of breath have vanished, however, he has noticed that he is sleeping less well and occasionally has nocturnal palpitations, which potentially could represent pacing from his pacemaker.\n\nInterrogation today of his Medtronic Kappa QQ 626 pacemaker reveals that his underlying rhythm is sinus tachycardia with intact AV conduction.  His estimated battery longevity is 89 months.  The atrial impedance is 569 ohms, the ventricular impedance is 529 ohms.  The P-wave is 5.6 mV.  The R-wave is 31.3 mV.  The threshold in the atrium is 0.75 V at 0.4 mV, and the threshold in the ventricle is 0.75 V at 0.4 msec.\n\nIn summary, Mr. Hess is doing extremely well after his pacemaker placement.  His pacemaker incision is extremely well healed.  There is no sign of erythema or hematoma.  However, his sinus tachycardia is mildly perplexing.  Looking at his heart rate histogram, it appears that this sinus rates have varied from 80-120 beats per minute for the most part aside from some low heart rate that potentially are nocturnal.  I have performed some pacing maneuvers today in clinic to attempt to determine whether the mechanism of his current tachycardia is sinus and it appears that this is sinus tachycardia.  For this reason, I have performed a TSH today, which is normal, however, I suggest to you that potentially a cursory endocrine workup and potentially a repeat echocardiogram at your facility might be indicated.  I am available to discuss these findings with you at any time.  I plan to see Mr. Hess in followup in three months' time, and if any issues arise in the interim, please do not hesitate to contact me.\n\nSincerely,\n\n\n\n\n\n______________________________\nUna Trujillo, MD\n\n\nDictated By: Una Trujillo\n\n\neScription document:9-1748355 UFFocus\n\n\nCC: Robert Yousif Gordon MD\n803 FAIRHAVEN ROAD\nOLNEY, OH 23751\n\nDD: 02/27/60\nDT: 02/27/60\nDV: 02/26/60\nRecord date: 2060-05-21\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHESS, CLARENCE\n\n64365595\n\n05/21/2060\n\n\n\n\n\nRobert Y.

As you know, he is a 54-year-old gentleman who underwent implantation of a permanent pacemaker on 02/11/2060 for his presyncope and pauses on Holter monitoring.\n\n\n\nHis past medical history is significant for hyperlipidemia, gastroesophageal reflux disease, and asthma.  Prior to his pacemaker placement, an exercise stress test was performed because of a history of exertional chest pain.  He was able to exercise for 8 minutes and 4 seconds.  The test was terminated for 7/10 substernal chest pain, but no hypotension or overt ECG changes were noted.  We proceeded to pacemaker implant and Mr. Hess has done well since that time.  He remarks that his intermittent symptoms of lightheadedness have resolved.  However, he occasionally still has nocturnal palpitations as well as occasional exertional chest discomfort.  He tells me that he underwent testing at Wheatland Memorial consisting of a stress test with MIBI imaging that perhaps showed an abnormality, though the report of this test is not available to me today for review.\n\n\n\nInterrogation today of his Medtronic Kappa CTE 226 pacemaker reveals that his underlying rhythm is sinus tachycardia with intact AV conduction.  The estimated longevity on the battery life is 95 months.  The atrial impedance is 544 ohms and the ventricular impedance is 519 ohms.  The P-wave in the atrium is 5.6 mV and the R-wave in the ventricle is 31 mV.  The threshold in the atrium is stable at 0.5 V at 0.4 msec, and the threshold in the ventricle is also stable at 0.5 V at 0.4 msec.\n\n\n\nIn summary, the pacemaker appears to be working quite well.  However, Mr. Hess persists in a perplexing sinus tachycardia that has been present since his last pacemaker interrogation.  I have therefore ordered an echocardiogram to rule out any ill effects of the sinus tachycardia or any structural heart disease that may be causing the sinus tachycardia.  In addition, I have performed a 12-lead ECG, which appears to show sinus mechanism rather than an atrial tachycardia.  Today in the office, his sinus rate is 109 beats per minute with stable blood pressure.  Mr. Hess and I have checked thyroid studies in the recent past and those have been unremarkable.  \n\n\n\nI have discussed this case with Dr. Quatrell Swanson who has agreed to assist in Cardiology care for Mr. Hess in the near future, since Dr. Law is moving his practice to the NCHC.  I plan to see Mr. Hess in followup in three months' time for his pacemaker.  If any issues arise in the interim, please do not hesitate to contact me.\n\n\n\nSincerely,\n\n\n\n\n\n______________________________\n\nUna Trujillo, MD\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\neScription document:4-3989721 UFFocus transcriptionists\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDD: 06/02/60\n\nDT: 06/02/60\n\nDV: 05/21/60\nRecord date: 2060-08-05\n\n     5 August 2060\n\n\n\n\n\nQuatrell Swanson, MD\n\nDivision of Cardiology\n\nBarney Convalescent Hospital\n\n\n\nRe:\tClarence H. HESS\n\n\tBCH 643-65-59-5\n\n\n\nDear Dr. Swanson:\n\n\n\nI had the pleasure of caring for Clarence Hess at BCH 08/04-03/07.  He is a 54-year-old man with obesity, dyslipidemia and hypertension, S/P dual-chamber pacemaker placement by Dr. Una Trujillo in February, 2060.  He complained of fatigue and exertional throat tightness and a nuclear stress test in June, 2060, revealed apical ischemia and an ejection fraction of 70 percent.  Cardiac catheterization performed by Dr. Leslie Campbell on 08/04/60 via the right radial artery revealed a right dominant system, a tight lesion in the proximal LAD, and no other focally occlusive disease.  He received a 3mm stent, postdilated to 3.5mm, with an excellent angiographic result.  \n\n\n\nHe spent an uneventful night without complaints, ambulating and voiding without difficulty.  His right wrist was stable, and his hand warm and well perfused.  Morning labs included a BUN of 16, creatinine 0.9, negative cardiac enzymes, hematocrit 36.4, platelets 238,000, cholesterol 182, HDL 37, LDL 91 and triglycerides 269.  He was discharged home on aspirin, 325mg po qd; Plavix, 75mg po qd, to be continued for at least six months according to the research trial protocol; atenolol, 50mg po qd; Lipitor, 80mg po qd; Prilosec, 20mg po qd; Proventil, two puffs qid; and sublingual nitroglycerin, prn chest pain.  We've asked him to see you in the next couple of weeks, and to call if he has questions before then.  He also will follow up with the research staff per protocol guidelines.  Thank you for allowing us to participate in his care.  Please don't hesitate to call with questions.\n\n\n\nSincerely,\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBrittany Witt, MD\n\nBW/brown\n\ncc:\tRobert Y.

Unfortunately, we did not connect back in December following the receipt of his lipid data that included a marked and unacceptable LDL elevation.  We had left a message with his daughter, Lea.  Additional laboratory data at that time included a hemoglobin A1c of 6.2%.\n\nHe is seeking to establish a new relationship with a primary care physician through Barney Convalescent Hospital.  He has also had problems of at least 2 years duration with erectile dysfunction and decreased libido.\n\nMEDICATIONS:  His medications are atenolol 50 mg b.i.d., atorvastatin 80 mg daily, ezetimibe 10 mg daily, Ecotrin 325 mg daily, Prilosec 20 mg daily.  He apparently ran out of his clopidogrel some time ago and did not renew the prescription.  It was his understanding that he was to remain on this medication for only six months following the PCI procedure.\n\nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  His heart rate at rest is 105.  His initial blood pressure 149/96, but then 150/82 on repeat, using a large cuff.  His weight is down 4 pounds to 193.  His venous pressure and carotid upstrokes are normal.  His lung fields are clear.  He has no cardiac murmur.  There are no pulse deficits or peripheral edema.\n\nHis ECG shows a sinus tachycardia (after rushing into the office) and an incomplete right bundle-branch block pattern with a normal QRS duration.  In comparison with his tracing from 12/24/2060, his resting heart rate has increased.\n\nASSESSMENT AND PLAN:  He will keep a diary of blood pressure and heart rate recordings over the next month on the basis of which we will determine next steps.  It is possible that the higher dose beta-blocker contributes to his erectile dysfunction, though the problem may have antedated this medication altogether.  We will refer him to the practice of Dr. Ohara and Dr. Xiao, as well as to Dr. Sutherland, the latter specifically to help us evaluate his longstanding erectile dysfunction.\n\nHe will continue his efforts at weight loss.  He is working out at the gym 2-3 times per week.\n\n\n______________________________\nQuatrell Swanson, M.D.\n\n\n\n\n\neScription document:5-9051404 AFFocus\n\n\n\nDD: 07/08/60\nDT: 07/09/60\nDV: 07/08/60"}

I confirm\n\nthat I have interviewed and examined the patient, reviewed the\n\nresident's documentation on the patient's chart, and discussed\n\nthe evaluation, plan of care, and disposition with the patient.\n\nCHIEF COMPLAINT:  A 55-year-old male with vomiting.\n\nHISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient with end-stage multiple\n\nsclerosis as well as neurogenic bladder and chronic indwelling\n\nFoley who presents from the nursing home after 4 episodes of\n\nvomiting since 10:00 a.m.  He has had also progressive abdominal\n\ndistention, he reports over the last 3-4 weeks.  Nursing note\n\nalso reports decreased urine output for the last 2 days.  He had\n\na KUB done at the referring facility that demonstrated a question\n\nof a small bowel obstruction but this film was not sent with him.\n\n He also had a fever today per report.  The patient denies any\n\nabdominal pain, shortness of breath, chest pain, or other\n\ncomplaints.  He does have a history of an ileus and prior\n\nadmissions for urosepsis with levofloxacin resistant E. coli.  He\n\nreports a mild cough.\n\nPAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Remarkable for hypertension, multiple\n\nsclerosis, anemia, decubitus ulcers, neurogenic bladder, and\n\nurethral strictures.\n\nPAST SURGICAL HISTORY:  He is status post urethral stenting.\n\nSocial history, family history, and review of systems are as per\n\nwritten note.\n\nMEDICATIONS:  Prozac, Actonel, ferrous sulfate, aspirin,\n\nmultivitamins, lisinopril, Lipitor, and Prilosec.\n\nALLERGIES:  None.\n\nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  The patient is awake and alert, generally\n\nchronically ill appearing, quite pleasant.  Vital signs are\n\nwithin normal limits as documented except for an elevated pulse\n\nrate of 120 beats per minute, respiratory rate of 24, room air\n\nsaturations of 93% and a temperature of 99.2.  For full physical\n\nexam findings, please see the resident's written note. \n\nSpecifically, HEENT exam is atraumatic.  There is a 1-cm ulcer on\n\nroof of his mouth.  He has synechiae of his pupils that are 2 mm\n\nand nonreactive.  His extraocular movements are not alignment. \n\nNeck exam is normal as documented.  Respiratory exam reveals\n\nscattered bronchi.  There is no chest wall tenderness. \n\nCardiovascular exam reveals tachycardia without murmur. \n\nAbdominal exam is distinctly distended and slightly firm with\n\nhypoactive bowel sounds but no tenderness, no rebound or\n\nguarding.  Skin is intact, warm, and dry on my exam. \n\nMusculoskeletal exam is nontender with no edema or bony point\n\ntenderness.  Neurologically, the patient has increased tone in\n\nhis lower extremities and weakness of all of his extremities. \n\nHis mood and affect is normal but he is dysarthric.  He is\n\nneurologically, however, appears to be at his baseline.\n\nLABORATORY DATA:  CBC and electrolytes remarkable for white blood\n\ncount 16.2, BUN and creatinine ratio of 40 and 1.0 respectively. \n\nLast creatinine was 0.5.  LFTs and lipase are within normal\n\nlimits as documented.  INR is 1.1.\n\nIMAGING STUDIES:  EKG demonstrates sinus rhythm with nonspecific\n\nST-T wave changes.  Plain films of the abdomen demonstrates\n\nscattered dilated loops of small bowel but no clear obstruction\n\nconsistent with possible ileus versus early obstruction.  Chest\n\nx-ray shows low lung volumes without any focal consolidation.\n\nIMPRESSION:  This is a patient with abdominal distention, is\n\nquite impressive as well as a firm belly with dilated loops of\n\nbowel on his KUB as well as history of vomiting earlier this\n\nevening.  He has had no vomiting here and does not feel\n\nnauseated, however, does not have an appetite.  He has had\n\ndecreased urine output and managed to put out a total 25 cc of\n\nurine through his Foley since 2:00 p.m. today.  Presently, he was\n\nnot tender over his bladder.  Upon flushing the Foley, there is a\n\nlarge amount of debris.  They came out and followed by high\n\npressure urine that had malodorous character to it.  I think this\n\npatient likely has an ileus and urinary tract infection.  He\n\nreceived antibiotics wide spectrum including vancomycin,\n\nlevofloxacin and Flagyl initially followed by gentamicin given\n\nhis prior levofloxacin resistance.\n\nPRIMARY DIAGNOSIS:  Urinary tract infection.\n\nSECONDARY DIAGNOSIS:  Ileus versus SBO.\n\nThe patient was admitted to the ED Observation Area for CT\n\nimaging, however will eventually require admission for this\n\nproblem likely to Medicine Service.\n\nDISPOSITION:  Admitted to ED Observation Unit.\n\n______________________________\n\nBENSON, KAILEE MD\n\nD: 10/15/92\n\nT: 10/15/92\n\nDictated By: BENSON, KAILEE\n\neScription document:7-8396761 BFFocus\n\n ******** Not reviewed by Attending Physician ********\nRecord date: 2093-08-09\n\nEDVISIT^03689964^VALENZUELA, BRIAN^08/09/93^BOYER, DAWN\n\nCHIEF COMPLAINT:  Fever.\n\nI saw this patient with Dr. Edwards.  Please see his note for\n\nfurther details.  I confirm that I have interviewed and examined\n\nthe patient, reviewed the resident's documentation, and\n\ndiscussed, plan of care, and disposition with the patient. \n\nHistory is obtained through discussion with the patient who says\n\nyes or no, as well as transporting paramedics.\n\nHISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 56-year-old\n\ngentleman with end-stage MS at nursing home.  He has indwelling\n\nFoley catheter.  He was transported from nursing home to ED as he\n\nhas had a fever today to approximately 100.5.  Per EMS, they were\n\ntold that the patient has also been more lethargic with decreased\n\nPOs today.  He received Tylenol and defervesced somewhat.  He\n\nthen received 400 mL of fluid en route and he has become more\n\nawake and alert.  He is telling the paramedics that he is at his\n\nbaseline.  He denies to me any headaches, neck pain.  No chest\n\npain, shortness of breath, no abdominal pain, no cough, no fevers\n\nor chills.  He reports that he is able to discern when he has\n\nabdominal pain.  He has intact sensation.\n\nPAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  As per HPI.  In addition, CAD, diabetes,\n\nhypertension, CHF.\n\nPlease see resident note for list of medication and allergies.\n\nSOCIAL HISTORY:  He does not smoke.  He does not drink.  He is at\n\na nursing home.  He is married.\n\nFAMILY HISTORY:  Noncontributory.\n\nREVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  As per resident note and my HPI.\n\nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  He is awake, alert, and nontoxic, in no\n\ndistress.  Afebrile, pulse in 90s, respiratory 18, blood pressure\n\n102/66, O2 saturation 99% on room air.  HEENT exam: \n\nNormocephalic and atraumatic.  Neck:  Supple.  He has coarse\n\nupper airway sounds bilaterally anteriorly.  Heart is regular\n\nrate and rhythm.  His abdomen is slightly distended.  He is\n\nnontender.  He has sacral decubitus ulcers that are well healing,\n\nno evidence of acute infection, contractures in his lower\n\nextremities.  He is alert and does say yes or no to questions.\n\nThe most likely etiology in this patient for an infection is his\n\nurinary tract infection.  His urine and his catheter was cloudy. \n\nPrior to sending the urine for evaluation for urinalysis to the\n\nlab, the patient had his catheter changed.  He then began to no\n\nlonger drain urine.  Accordingly, a bladder probe was put on\n\nusing ultrasound and clearly showed a distended bladder. \n\nAttempts were made to change the catheter, but they were\n\nunsuccessful.  There was pus found at the meatus.  At this point,\n\nthe patient is awaiting a CT scan of his abdomen and urology\n\nevaluation.  He is also receiving antibiotics for presumed UTI\n\nand/or abscess.\n\nLABORATORY DATA:  Include sodium 136, K 4.5, chloride 102,\n\nbicarbonate 22, BUN 22, creatinine 0.45, and glucose 136.  LFTs\n\nwithin normal limits.  Normal lipase.  White count of 5.7,\n\nhematocrit 35.5, and platelet count 306,000.  Coags within normal\n\nlimits.  UA again is pending at this time.\n\nHe will be admitted to the hospital.  I attempted to reach the\n\npatient's primary care physician, Dr. Earle to contact from the\n\nWBM office, however, my calls went unanswered.  At this point, I\n\nam signing out the patient and he is awaiting his CT scan and\n\nurology evaluation.\n\nDIAGNOSIS:  Urinary infection, mild dehydration, end-stage MS.\n\nCONDITION:  Stable.\n\nDISPOSITION:  Will be admitted.\n\n______________________________\n\nBOYER, DAWN MD\n\nD: 08/09/93\n\nT: 08/10/93\n\nDictated By: BOYER, DAWN\n\neScription document:6-1950972 BFFocus\n\n ******** Not reviewed by Attending Physician ********\nRecord date: 2094-10-23\n\nPatient: VALENZUELA,BRIAN   03689964Date of Admission: 10/23/2094\nAttending: Davila\n\n\nInternal Medicine Intern Admit Note\n\n\nCC: fever, lethargy, confusion\n\n\nHPI: 57M who lives in NH and has h/o severe MS-partially verbal at baseline, bedridden- recurrent UTIs and urosepsis with chronic indwelling foley, HTN, CAD,and CHF (EF 35-40%) who presents from NH with confusion, lethargy, and fever to 102.

He was golfing at the time, and suddenly developed weakness with no sensory changes. The weakness involved the face, arm and leg on the left side only. He went to Gilmore Hospital, where they checked his blood pressure, and found it to be 220/140 (per his report). A CT scan was performed, and he was informed that it was normal. He became frustrated with the ER there and signed out AMA. He went to the HCH at Easton 2 days later, his BP was still elevated, and they started him on clonidine. They attempted to arrange for a renal angiogram to work up his hypertension, but he declined. No further stroke/TIA workup was performed.\n\n\n\nHe comes to me for a second opinion regarding his workup. His weakness has greatly improved, but not back to normal. He has never had sensory changes, and no speech difficulties, anosognosia, neglect, or gait instability. He did have \"flashing lights in both eyes\" for fifteen minutes at the onset of the symptoms on the golf course, but none since then. He has never had transient monocular blindness, diplopia, or suddenly blurry vision.\n\n\n\nPast Medical History\t\n\nHypertension.\n\nHe is being worked up for possible renal artery stenosis. \n\nHe has not had his cholesterol checked.\n\n\n\nMedications\t    \n\nPROPRANOLOL (PROPRANOLOL HCL)\t 40MG PO BID Start Date: 10/1/32\n\nHCTZ (HYDROCHLOROTHIAZIDE)\t 12.5MG PO QD Start Date: 10/1/32\n\nCLONIDINE HCL\t 0.2MG PO BID Start Date: 10/1/32\n\nZESTRIL (LISINOPRIL)\t 40MG PO QD Start Date: 10/1/32\n\nASA (ACETYLSALICYLIC ACID)\t 81MG PO QD Start Date: 10/1/32\n\n\n\nAllergies\t  \n\nNKDA\t      \n\n\n\nSocial History\t\n\nlives in Avenal.

I have counseled him that most likely the best treatment for this type of stroke is to control his hypertension, and to use antiplatelet agents. I have asked that he increase his dose of ASA to 325 mg per day.\n\n\n\nIn addition, he needs a work up. I have arranged for him to have CNIS, 24 hour Holter monitoring, and TTE with bubble study. Additionally, we should check fasting lipids. \n\n\n\nHe wishes to have a PCP at FPC, and I have requested that he have the next available appointment with Dr. Harry Tolliver of the cardiology department, who could also be instrumental in adjusting his hypertension meds. \n\n\n\nHe will return to clinic in 2-3 months, and is to page me immediately with any new symptoms or concerns. \n\n\n\nCC\t\n\nDr. Harry Tolliver, FPC cardiology unit.\nRecord date: 2132-12-31\n\nPersonal Data and Overall Health\t\n\n75-year-old S/P L internal capsule stroke 6/32.\n\n\n\nReason for Visit\t\n\nMr. Slater returns to clinic today for routine follow up. I last saw him on 10/1/2132, and he has continued to improvesince that time. He remains on ASA 325mg po qd for stroke prevention, and continues to be worked up for renovascular hypertension. He has had no new stroke-like symptoms, and only very infrequently feels that the right leg is weak, usually at the end of the day when he is fatigued. He was recently seen by Dr. Harry Tolliver of the department of Cardiology. He underwent a 24-hour holter monitor, which showed no evidence for atrial fibrillation or other significant dysrhythmia. His CNIS have no evidence for disease.

ZIRKLE, MD \n\n \nATTENDING CONSULTATION NOTE \n \nDIAGNOSIS: Recurrent renal cell carcinoma.  \n \nHISTORY: Mr. Slater is a delightful and active 80-year-old man who was incidentally found to have a renal mass in 2133. At that time Dr. Updike performed a left partial nephrectomy, and the final pathology showed a 1.5 cm clear cell renal cell carcinoma. Since that date he has remained well with no clinical evidence of recurrent disease and has had interval CT scans. For the last 2 years, enhancing nodules have been noted within the region of the partial nephrectomy. A biopsy performed approximately 1 year ago did not demonstrate any cancer within modestly enlarged retroperitoneal lymph nodes. CT scan was repeated in December of 2137. This again showed some enlarged retroperitoneal adenopathy and also enlargement of the soft tissue nodules. Biopsy in March of this year showed probable recurrent renal cell carcinoma of the clear cell type within the nodules. Biopsy of an adjacent adrenal gland showed no cancer. His metastatic workup has included CT scans of the chest, which have demonstrated small pulmonary nodules of uncertain significance.  \n \nHe has met with Drs. Eagle and Yzaguirre. Both have recommended completion of the nephrectomy and resection of any visible tumor, perhaps with intraoperative radiation as well. \n  \nPAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  \n \n1. Hypertension.  \n \n2. CVA with residual weakness on the right side. He is, however, still able to walk with a cane.  \n \n3. High cholesterol.  \n \nCURRENT MEDICATIONS: Atenolol, hydrochlorothiazide, lisinopril, Norvasc, Avapro, clonidine, Lipitor, and allopurinol.   \n\nDRUG ALLERGIES: None known.  \n \nSOCIAL HISTORY: He is a long retired news writer with a heavy smoking history. He last smoked in 2132. He is a widow and came today to the appointment with 1 of his daughters.  \n \nREVIEW OF SYSTEMS: No respiratory symptoms suggesting progressive pulmonary metastases, no abdominal or GI symptoms.  \n \n\nPHYSICAL EXAM:\nNo anemia, jaundice, cyanosis, or clubbing\nNo gynecomastia\nRespiration comfortable\nMild right-sided motor weakness, walks with a cane. \nNo skeletal deformity or tenderness\nHead, eyes, ears, and nose normal \nAbdomen soft with no hepatomegaly, splenomegaly, nor any additional masses.\nNo hernias.\n \n \nRADIOLOGY: CT scans demonstrate multiple soft tissue nodules within the partial nephrectomy bed, the largest being 15 mm across. He also has prominent lymph nodes within the retroperitoneum, the largest of which is 14 mm, and an enlarged left common iliac lymph node of 18 mm. Chest CT shows scattered 2 mm nodules of uncertain significance.  \n \nIMPRESSION AND PLAN: Confirmed local recurrence of renal cell cancer - for completion nephrectomy and resection of tumor bed.  Lymph nodes will be also be sampled.  \n \nFor intraoperative radiation if appropriate and possibly adjuvant radiation to follow.  Consent obtained today.  \n \n \nURIEL T.

His dermatologist started prednisone (60 mg daily) three weeks ago for a pemphigiod flair.  Mr Slater&#8217;s sugars were initially well controlled off insulin, but a week and a half ago he began to develop lower extremity edema, DOE, and general fatigue.  He began to taper the prednisone (to 40 mg daily) and then stopped them altogether yesterday.  He presented to the FPC ED complaining of fatigue and weakness and was found to have a FSBG&gt;500.  His initial labs were notable for a glucose of 804.  An EKG showed a-fib (rate 70s).  His blood pressure, oxygenation, and respiratory were the normal range and he was given 2 L of NS and regular insulin.  Repeat labs showed Glu 479 w/ partial resolution of other electrolyte abnormalities.  He was admitted to the hospital for further evaluation and management.\n\n            On arrival to the floor, he reports feeling tired, but that his weakness and fatigue have improved since he arrived in the ED.  He continues to have LE edema, which has worsened in the last day.  He denies recent weight loss, fevers, cough, dyspnea or PND, syncope, N/V, diarrhea, constipation, melena, urinary symptoms, joint pain, bruising, worsening rash, skin lesions, double vision, dysarthria, headache, or focal weakness or numbness.  \n\n\n\n\n\nPAST MEDICAL HISTORY:\n\n\n&#183;         Bullous pemphigoid 2/2 simvastatin\n\n&#183;         Chronic kidney disease\n\n&#183;         RAS\n\n&#183;         History of CVA with residual minor weakness and numbness on the right side &#8216;00\n\n&#183;         Hypertension\n\n&#183;         Hypercholesterolemia\n\n&#183;         PVD (ABI 0.43/0.20 after exercise)\n\n&#183;         AAA 2.8 cm &#8216;06\n\n\n\n\n\nPAST SURGICAL HISTORY:\n\n\n&#183;         \n\n Stage III renal cell carcinoma status post L nephrectomy in 2133, now w/ metastatic disease (+ retroperitoneal LN 8/41)\n\n\n\nMEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:\n\n\nAmlodipine 5 mg PO daily\n\nAllopurinol 200 mg daily\n\nASA 325 daily\n\nDoxazosin 2 mg qHS\n\nHCTZ 12.5 PO daily\n\nAliskiren/HCTZ 12.5 mg daily\n\nClonidine 0.2 mg PO BID\n\n\n\n\n\nALLERGIES:\n simvastatin (pemphigoid); ezetimibe (rash) \n\n\n\n\n\n\nSOCIAL HISTORY:\n Retired political journalist.  60 pk year smoking history, but none currently.

Most likely etiology is steroid-induced hyperglycemia superimposed on ? underlying DM (HgbA1c 6.80 in the past).  No e/o infectious-trigger (urine culture negative and CXR equivocal).  Rapidly improving after IVF in ED and insulin.  Current FSBG 330.  Diagnostic evaluation: will send repeat HgbA1c, FSBG before meals, qd electrolytes.  Therapeutic intervention: will hold IVF given new a-fib and signs of volume overload (see below); give 10 U regular insulin now and SSI with meals (convert daily usage to NPH); potassium repletion PRN\n\n\n\n\n#) A-fib:\n New onset a-fib.  Differential includes fluid overload, hyperthyroidism, pre-existing structural heart disease (LAH, mitral regurg/stenosis).  CHADS2 score: 12.5% risk of stroke over the next year if not on anticoagulation.  Currently rate-controlled 80s.  Diagnostic evaluation: echocardiogram, TSH, cardiac monitor.  Therapeutic intervention: d/c amlodipine (given LE edema) and start low dose dilt (30 mg TID) for continued rate control.  On ASA.  Will discuss risks/benefits of coumadin w/ patient and PCP.\n\n\n\n#) Troponin leak: In the absence of chest pain/angina or concerning EKG changes, this likely represents heart strain in the context of chronic kidney disease. \nWill trend enzyme, repeat EKG, and monitor for changes in clinical status.\n\n\n\n\n#) Edema\n: differential includes congestive heart failure vs worsening kidney disease vs iatrogenic volume overload vs capillary leak syndrome (from steroids, norvasc). \nGiven duration, clinical picture, and elevated BNP (although no baseline comparison), concerning for CHF.  Diagnostic evaluation: echocardiogram, TSH, etc. w/ more extensive evaluation as needed.  Therapeutic intervention: will hold lasix given underlying kidney function, continue HCTZ, monitor I/Os.\n\n\n\n\n#) Bullous pemphigoid\n: Will restart prednisone taper at 40 mg daily per dermatology outpatient note w/ goal of one additional week, then 20 mg daily for three weeks. \nWill contact dermatology regarding modifications to the regimen, if any.\n\n\n\n\n#) HTN\n: Currently well-controlled.

The LDL is now quite low at 93 but the HDL\nhas declined to 34.  All in all, the results are compatible with\nbetter glucose control and the action of Atorvastatin 10 mg is\nlikely responsible for the very low LDL but on the other hand\ndiscontinuation of the gemfibrozil probably lowered the HDL.  The\neffect on triglycerides of the low dose of the Atorvastatin is\nminimal and overall the triglyceride lowering effect is overrated\nexcept at the high dose of 80 mg.  Even at 80 mg Atorvastatin could\nnot compare to the fibrates in the triglyceride lowering action.\n \nHer current medications are Atorvastatin 10 mg, Lopressor 25 mg,\nProcardia 60 mg b.i.d., Capoten 50 mg t.i.d., and  Insulin 22 units\nA.M.\n \nLabs: Cholesterol 220, TG. 460, HDL 34, LDL 93.\n \nBlood pressure is 120/80.\n \nI restarted the Gemfibrozil, 600 mg b.i.d. and left her on the\nAtorvastatin 10 mg.  Although I don't expect any side effects with\nthis low dose of Atorvastatin and Gemfibrozil I warned Mrs. Werner\nand her husband that if she should have generalized muscle aches or\nweakness she should contact us and discontinue medication. \nI think that aggressive therapy is warranted in Mrs. Werner.\n \n \n \npage 2\nNancy Werner\nNovember 26, 2114 \n \n \n \nPlease feel free to call or e-mail me if you have questions. \n \nBest Wishes.\n \n \nSincerely,\n \n \n \n \nIsaac Q.

Briefly, the history is as \nfollows:  The patient is a 47 year old male with end stage renal \ndisease on hemodialysis who was referred for abdominal discomfort \nand fever.  His abdominal discomfort had begun within the preceding \n24 hours and had gradually worsened.  He had pain in the left lower \nquadrant radiating to the rectal area.  He did have one diarrheal \nbowel movement.  He specifically denied bleeding. \nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  GENERAL APPEARANCE:  The patient was awake \nand alert, although somewhat sluggish and apparently uncomfortable. \nVITAL SIGNS:  Blood pressure was 177/90, pulse 117, initial \ntemperature 103.3, respiratory rate 20.

LUNGS: \nThe breath sounds were essentially clear.  ABDOMEN:  There was mild \nto moderate diffuse tenderness.  No definite mass can be \nappreciated.  Bowel sounds were diminished.  RECTAL:  Stool is \nguaiac-negative, per the resident's examination.  EXTREMITIES: \nExamination of the left thigh showed slight drainage at a recent \nsurgical incision site. \nLABORATORY EVALUATION:  Electrolytes showed sodium 139, potassium \n4.3, chloride 99, CO2 27, BUN 12, creatinine 2.2, glucose 230. \nWhite blood cell count was 30,000, hematocrit 38.  Chest x-ray \nshowed no definite infiltrate.  Abdominal x-ray showed dilated \nloops of small bowel.  EKG showed no change from previous tracings. \nTHERAPY RENDERED/COURSE IN ED:  The assessment and plan were \nreviewed with the resident. \nFINAL DIAGNOSIS:  I confirm the provisional diagnosis of abdominal \npain with question of deep venous thrombosis versus sepsis from as \nyet unidentified source. \nDISPOSITION (including condition upon discharge):  The care plan \nwas reviewed.

As you know,\nMr. Branche underwent a\nleft femoral to posterior\ntibial bypass one month\nago followed by\namputation of a\ngangrenous first toe.\nAfter being discharged\nfrom our service he was\nreadmitted to the Medical\nService with a severe\ncase of C. difficile\ncolitis.  Ultimately this\nresolved and he was\ndischarged.  Today he\nreports that the diarrhea\nhas again resumed and he\nwas placed back on an\noral antibiotic\nyesterday.  He complains\nof only mild incisional\ndiscomfort in his left\nleg.\n \nOn examination, there is\na strong pulse easily\npalpated over the left\nlower extremity bypass\ngraft.  The old right\nlower extremity bypass\ngraft was also palpable.\nThe left foot itself is\nwarm.  The great toe\nincision site, however,\nhas developed necrotic\ntissue all along the\nincision, which was\nsharply debrided to clean\nmargins.  This will now\nneed to be treated as an\nopen wound.  The calf\nportion of the left lower\nextremity incision also\nhas a narrow zone of\nsuperficial skin slough\nwhich was gently\ndebrided.  The graft is\nnot exposed and there are\nno deep wounds in the\nleg.\n \nMr. Branche's left lower\nextremity bypass graft is\nfunctioning well.\nHowever, he will require\nsignificant ongoing wound\ncare for the immediate\nfuture.  Daily dressing\nchanges will be arranged\nwith visiting nurse\nservices.  We plan to\nfollow him closely and an\nappointment was given for\ntwo weeks.\n \nThanks again for allowing\nus to participate in the\ncare of this delightful\nand challenging patient\nand please don't hesitate\nto contact me at any time\nif I can\nRE:  Branche, Earnest\nMRN: 53023691\n7-8-81\nPage 2\n \n \n \nbe of further assistance.\n \nSincerely,\n \n \nLuis J.

The resident's note was reviewed and the patient was \ninterviewed and examined by me. \nHISTORY OF PRESENTING COMPLAINT:  The patient is a very pleasant, \n50 year-old gentleman who presents with gross hematemesis and \ncoffee-ground emesis.  He had it during the night and then this \nmorning developed coffee-grounds turned to red blood emesis.  He \ndenies any light-headedness, chest pain or abdominal pain.  He has \nhad some diarrhea over the last seven months, of unclear etiology. \nNo melena. \nPAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Chronic renal failure, myocardial \ninfarction, insulin dependent diabetes. \nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  GENERAL:  The patient was hemodynamically \nstable, well-appearing, nontoxic.  LUNGS:  Clear.  HEART:  Regular \nrate and rhythm.  ABDOMEN:  Soft with tenderness to palpation in \nthe bilateral lower quadrants.

Mr. Branch is now two years out from a right femoral-\ntibial bypass and nine months out from a left femoral-tibial \nbypass with subsequent transmetatarsal amputation of the left foot \nand split-thickness skin grafting.  Over the last several months, \nhe has been undergoing dressing changes to remaining, small, \nsuperficial, open wounds on the dorsum of the left foot.  Over the \nlast one to two weeks, he began to note the development of a new \narea of dark skin on the lateral aspect of the left foot and \nrecently has noted some drainage.  He denies any fevers.  In \naddition and of note, he complains of recent onset of pain in the \nright eye and has an appointment at the Ophthalmology Clinic \nimmediately following his visit with us.  He last underwent \nvascular lab studies in September at which time both lower \nextremity bypass grafts were widely patent and without stenoses.\n \nOn examination today, there are strong, easily palpable pulses \nover both lower extremity bypass grafts.  The right foot is warm \nand without any new ischemic skin changes or lesions.  On \nexamination of the left foot, there is a large area of full-\nthickness skin necrosis on the lateral aspect of the foot where \nthere had never been any previous open wounds.  This area \nencompasses a significant proportion of the lateral aspect of the \nfoot from the end of the transmetatarsal incision to the proximal \nmid foot.  On probing, purulent material drains from the margins \nand there is obvious significant sepsis.  The foot itself is warm \nand there is a good posterior tibial Doppler signal at the ankle.\n \nUnfortunately, Mr. Branch has developed a new, large wound on the \nleft foot which likely began as a pressure (decubitus) ulceration \ndue to his severe neuropathy.  This is now complicated by \nsignificant local sepsis and there is a large area of soft tissue \nloss on the foot.  He will require urgent admission and operative \ndebridement today.  In addition, given the extent of the problem, \nit is likely that he will ultimately come to below-knee amputation \nin the end.  Immediately following his visit to the Ophthalmology \nClinic, he will be admitted to the\n \n \nRE:Branch, Earnest\nMRN:53023691\n3-8-82\nPage 2\n \n \n \nhospital with the hopes of performing debridement and drainage \nlater today.  I will certainly continue to keep you apprised of \nhis progress.\n \nSincerely, \n \n \n \nLuis J.

I also saw \n\nthe patient, reviewed the resident's note, and discussed evaluation \n\nand plan. \n\nPRESENTING COMPLAINT:  Shortness of breath and nausea.\n\nHISTORY OF PRESENTING COMPLAINT:  This 49-year-old man has been \n\ncomplaining of shortness of breath for the last 24 hours.  He came \n\nin complaining of that plus some nausea and was found to have a \n\nhighly elevated glucose and was sent over here.  The patient denies \n\nany chest pain or pain any place else, but he does state that he \n\nfeels poorly.  Of note, on transport and on arrival here, his blood \n\nsugar was noted to be greater than 600.  The patient does not \n\ncomplain of blurry vision and does not complain of \n\nlight-headedness, just the nausea and the shortness of breath. \n\nREVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  As per the resident's note. \n\nPAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Cardiomyopathy.  Otherwise, as per the \n\nresident's note. \n\nSOCIAL HISTORY AND FAMILY HISTORY:  As per the resident's note. \n\nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Significant findings include a pulse of 76, \n\nrespirations 22.  The patient appears to be in no acute distress.  \n\nThe lungs display crackles bilaterally to the mid lung.  There is \n\njugular venous distention elevation to the angle of the jaw.  \n\nCardiac examination is otherwise normal.  Abdominal examination is \n\nwithin normal limits.  The patient has a colostomy.  The patient \n\nhas a left below-knee amputation and toe-digit-toe amputation on \n\nthe right side.  Otherwise, there are no musculoskeletal \n\nabnormalities.  There are some decubitus ulcers which are stable.\n\nLABORATORY EVALUATION:  Laboratories are significant for a glucose \n\nof 934, sodium 127, anion gap 17, bicarb 19, creatinine and BUN 5.8 \n\nand 37, hematocrit 30, which is not too different from his usual.  \n\nHis pH is 7.42.  CK is 54, but troponin is 1.45.  Of note, however, \n\nthe patient does have renal conditions.  EKG shows new deep Qs in \n\n2, 3, and F compared to one done a month ago.  Chest x-ray shows \n\nsome excess interstitial markings indicative of increased fluid.\n\nTHERAPY RENDERED/COURSE IN ED:  This patient appears to have \n\ncongestive heart failure.  He may be having new cardiac event, \n\nalthough after a consultation with the Integra Health\n\ncardiologist, he felt that perhaps this might not be a new event, \n\nbut rather due to axis deviation.  The patient is being treated for \n\nhis hyperglycemia and is being admitted.\n\nFINAL DIAGNOSES:\n\n1.  Rule out myocardial infarction.\n\n2.  Hyperglycemia.\n\nDISPOSITION (including condition upon discharge):  The patient was \n\nadmitted to the hospital in stable condition. \n\n___________________________________                    ZI623/55469 \n\nFAITH GALINDO, M.D.       FG9                         D:12/31/82 \n\n                                                       T:12/31/82 \n\nDictated by:  FAITH GALINDO, M.D.       FG9 \n\n ******** Not reviewed by Attending Physician ********"}

Surgery is scheduled on May 31, 2066 by Dr. Patrick Frantz.\n\n\n\nChief Complaint & Present Illness:  Patient reports that she was having difficulty with constipation and colonoscopy was scheduled 5/07/66.  Colonoscopy showed a malignant appearing tumor or possibly a villous adenoma in the cecum.  Pathology revealed adenocarcinoma.\n\n\n\nPatient reports a history of angina stating that it is usually precipitated by stress or anxiety as well as exertion.  Describes angina as left-sided anterior chest pain that is stabbing in nature and constant.  Sometimes she gets relief from this pain by applying pressure to chest with her hand.  However, if pain is severe enough she usually takes one nitroglycerin tablet.  Occasionally nausea will accompany chest pain.  States pain occurs most frequently at night and she usually confines herself to taking nitroglycerin tablets only at night, not with daytime pain.  Most recent stress test done 11/63 showed that patient had a normal exercise capacity, METS=8,  EKG that was negative for ischemia in response to stress, and myocardial scans were within normal limits and did not show evidence of ischemia or infarction.  Cardiac ultrasound done 10/62 showed a normal left ventricular size and systolic function, no segmental wall motion abnormalities, and an EF of 62%.\n\n\n\nPatient reports that she developed a cough approximately two weeks ago productive of white/tan sputum.  She also has nasal discharge that is yellowish in color.  Was evaluated at the urgent care clinic 5/20/66 no antibiotics were started.  Patient denies fever, chills, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea.\n\n\n\nPast Medical History:  Significant medical problems include:  \n\n1.  Diabetes (insulin-dependent, 3/66 HBA1C was 8.90)\n\n2.

He had preserved LV function and pre-operative cardiac catheterization showed multi vessel non-obstructive CAD.  He initially did well, but had a prolonged hospitalization in 7/17.  At that time, he developed acute cholecystitis and post-ERCP pancreatitis which was complicated by phlegmon and pseudocyst formation.  He was admitted to PNC in 1/18 for elective open cholecystectomy and roux-en-Y cyst-jejunostomy.  He underwent the GI surgery on 1/11/18.  His post-operative course was complicated by recurrent GIB upon re-initiation of anti-coagulation for the mechanical AVR that prolonged his hospital stay. \n\nUnfortunately, he developed line-associated bactermeia and sepsis 4 weeks into the hospitalization.  He developed high fevers on 2/07/18 ad he had serial cultures positive for MRSA that had intermediate sensitivity to Vancomycin.  He was initially treated with Vancomycin and Gentamicin with addition of Rifampin later in the course of treatment.  He developed progressive PR prolongation on ECG and  a TTE on 2/10/18 and TEE on 2/11/18 showed vegetations on the aortic prosthesis with evidence of annular involvement with abscess.  A follow-up TEE on 2/17/18 showed worsening aortic root abscess and he was ultimately taken to the OR by Dr. Elrod on 2/17/18.  The intraoperative findings were notable were notable for severe aortic root involvement and he underwent composite aortic homograft replacement that was complicated by severe RV failure.  On POD 0, he had recurrent malignant arrhythmias (VT/VF) which required ~ 50 defibrillations and open cardiac massage.  A TEE done after stabilization showed global akinesis and severe TR, and preserved LV function.  Emergent coronary angiogram showed evidence of RCA vasospasm.  An IABP was placed and he was treated with beta blockade and for vasospasm.  HE was taken to the OR for closure on 2/22/18.\n\nHis course was subsequently notable for ARF which transiently required CVVH, development of HIT, and vascular emboli to the right lower extremity which led to dry gangrene og the right 3rd digit. ABI testing revealed no evidence of PAD.  He was followed by ID and was placed on daptomycin and Bactrim. He was seen by Vascular surgery and was not deemed to require any surgical intervention and was scheduled for outpatient follow up.  With supportive care, he was successfully weaned off IABP and ventilatory support and transferred to the step down unit.  His course there was notable for mild hyperkalemia that was felt to be related to Bactrim induced RTA. He also had severe depression that was felt to be related an adjustment disorder. He was discharged to a rehab facility on 3/22/18 and was discharged from rehab 12 dyas ago.\n\nSince discharge, he reports doing relatively well. He reports fatigue and DOE after walking up a flight of stairs.  He is able to walk up to 15-20 minutes continuously.  He denies any chest pain, dyspnea at rest, PND, orthopnea, LE edema, palpitations, syncope, or pre-syncope. He also denies any fevers, chills, or weight loss. He has been seen in follow up by Dr. Infant-Nickel in ID earlier this month.  He was noted to be doing relatively well but still had an elevated ESR and CRP.  The plan is continue a prolonged oral taper of Bactrim.  He has completed a 6 week course of daptomycin.\n\n\n\tPast medical history:\n   1. MRSA/VISA prosthetic aortic valve endocarditis. Originally underwent AVR for severe AS on 03/13/2117. Developed aortic endocarditis and aortic root abscess as a complication of line sepsis in 2/18 and underwent composite aortic homograft replacement on 2/19/18. Intraoperatively developed severe RV failure.\n2. RV failure. Complication of aortic homograft surgery. TEE on 2/20/18 showed severe RV hypokinesis and severe TR.\n3. HIT. Developed HIT post-operatively after aortic homograft replacement in 2/18.\n4. Coronary artery disease. Preoperative cardiac catheterization on 03/11/2117 demonstrated 30% focal narrowing in the left main; proximal 30% lesion in the LAD; 50% lesion in D1; mid 50% lesion in the left circumflex, and normal RCA. \n5. Dry gangrene of right 3rd digit of right foot thought to be secondary to an embolic complication of IABP versus HITT.\n6. Hypertension. \n7.

The patient had a prolonged hospitalization with a complicated post-operative course that was notable for RV failure, ARF, HIT, vascular emboli to the right foot, and mild hyperkalemia.  At this point, he appears close to euvolemia by exam and has no evidence of decompensated CHF. HE has evidence of severe TR on exam. From an ID perspective although all recent cultures have been negative, the resistance pattern of his MRSA and persistent elevation of ESR and CRP are concerning, and he will require a prolonged course of anti-biotics as outlined by Dr. Infant-Nickel.  His ARF has resolved and his vascular embolic events to the right foot are not an active, acute issue as he only has dry gangrene and no evidence of infection. \n\nPLAN:\n1. PVE endocarditis.  He is s/p composite aortic homograft replacement. He will need a prolonged Bactrim taper per ID. We will obtain CBC, chem panel, LFTs, ESR, CRP per ID today. He is currently on coumadin and will likely need this for a total of ~6-8 weeks post-operatively.  We will continue coumadin pending his visit with Dr. Elrod next week.\n2. RV failure.  Currently well compensated with no evidence of systemic congestion.  We will continue his current dose of lasix.  Dry weight ~175-178 lbs. I will obtain a repeat TTE to reassess RV and TR severity.  We anticipate some recovery of RV function.  \n3. ARF. Resolved. We will check a follow up chem panel today.\n4. Right foot gangrene. Involvement of the right 3rd toe with no wet gangrene or signs of infection.  ABI testing in 3/18 showed no PAD.  He will need outpatient follow up with Dr. Werner in vascular surgery.\n5. CAD. Non-obstructive disease.  Continue ASA, atenolol and lipitor.  We will hold on ACE-inhibitor given hyperkalemia issues.\n6. Hyperkalemia.  Likely secondary to RTA related to Bactrim.  Ww will check follow up chem panel today.  He will need monitoring of K and we can consider kayexlate therapy if he has persistent elevations for the duration of therapy with Bactrim.   \n\nPatient will return to clinic in 3 months for follow-up.

He has passed some tissue, and had some gross hematuria with his last visit, but has not had any symptoms since then. \n\n  \n\nWith his BPH, he has not had any significant worsening of his nocturia or daytime frequency.  He feels as if he is emptying his bladder well now on the Cardura.  He did have some dysuria, and Dr. Geiger gave him a pill which seems to have helped him.  \n\n \n\nHis review of systems today is negative.  His past medical history is unchanged, and he is continuing with a cholesterol medication, a pill for burning, Cardura, and Atenolol. \n\n  \n\nOn physical examination, his vital signs show him to be well-nourished and well-developed.  His respirations are 14.  His pulse is regular.  A general examination shows his neck to be supple.  He is alert and oriented x 3.  He has no labored breathing.  He has no palpable groin adenopathy.  His skin has normal turgor, and his cardiovascular exam shows no JVD.\n\n   \n\nA complete GU examination shows his epididymis to be without masses.  A rectal exam shows his anus to be without masses.  His scrotum is without lesions.  His urethral meatus has no discharge.  His prostate has some BPH, but no nodularity.  His penis has no foreskin lesions.  His testes have no masses.  His seminal vesicles have no masses.  His sphincter tone is normal. \n\n  \n\nAn independent review of a urinalysis today is negative.  A review of clinical lab testes shows a nuclear matrix protein less than 10 on 11/14/87.  This was done via PCIS.  A post-void residual today is 14 cc.  \n\n \n\nFor his BPH, I believe he should continue with Cardura 2 mg p.o.  q.d.  His stone disease is quiescent, and he will let me know if there are any recurrences with symptoms of these.  We will consider checking a KUB in one year's time.  He will let me know if there are any difficulties in the interim.   \n\n \n\n_______________________________ \n\nVictor R.

They are too big for office treatment.  Therefore discussed the option of hemorrhoidectomy, which would probably give her a nice result.  She wishes to think about it for now, however, which is fine.  In the meantime, gave her info brochure plus instructions in conservative RX hemorrhoids.  \n\n\n\nThomas Y.

End-stage renal disease.  Because of her original end-stage renal disease was reportedly FSGS, she had a preemptive transplant in 2068, which was complicated by rejection and ultimate loss of the graft.  She resumed dialysis in 2072.  She had a second transplant in 2075, which was also complicated and ultimately rejected.  She resumed hemodialysis in 2082.  She does have a match with her only daughter, but apparently the Transplant Service feels that she would not be a good candidate and I think she would be reluctant to go through two surgeries, which would be required, one to remove the old graft and one for the new transplant.  She currently is dialyzed at the Overbrook Hospital.  Her dialysis physician is Dr. Lemus.\n2.  Hypertension.\n3.  Peripheral vascular disease.  She had an angiogram in 2083 at LMC and an MRA in 2085, which showed bilateral iliac and femoral artery stenoses.  She apparently does not have claudication despite this.\n4.  History of right foot-drop.  She had a severe episode of shingles in 2077 with associated sciatica and foot-drop.\n5.  History of hemorrhoids for at least six years with occasional bleeding and with anal protrusion.\n6.  History of CMV colitis in 08/2081.\n7.  Secondary hyperparathyroidism.  She is on Sensipar and has been on this since early 2085.\n\nPAST SURGICAL HISTORY:  She had a supracervical hysterectomy for benign disease in 2061 and a left salpingo-oophorectomy for a serous cyst in 04/2082.  She is status post appendectomy.  She is status post bilateral cataract surgery.\n\nMEDICATIONS:  Norvasc 10 mg per day, lisinopril 20 mg per day, metoprolol 50 mg b.i.d., Lipitor 40 mg per day, aspirin 81 mg per day, Nephrocaps 1 mg per day, Restoril 15 mg nightly, Hectorol 4 mcg per 2 mL three times per week, B6 200 mg per day, vitamin E 400 mg per day, flaxseed oil 1000 mg per day and B12 4000 mcg per day.\n\nFAMILY HISTORY:  Significant for diabetes in her father and grandfather, negative for cancer.\n\nSOCIAL HISTORY:  She is a widow.  She is a lifetime nonsmoker.  She does not drink alcohol or use drugs.  She is a retired mathematician at Vassar.  She came from Turlock 10 years ago to Pecos to be with her daughter who is a surgeon in the area.  She never has felt the Pecos as home and is home sick for Turlock.\n\nALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.\n\nREVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  She has had some problems with left shoulder pain and immobility.  She generally seems to be somewhat overwhelmed and a little bit sad.  She seems never to have adjusted to life in Pecos.  She has had the loss of two the kidney transplants and then the foot-drop, which has made walking difficult.  She did have a brace at one time, which helped her to walk, but it was irritating.  She had seen Dr. Yim to get another one, but that never worked out.  She did not complain of any chest pain or shortness of breath, no constipation.  She does have hemorrhoids that are active as above.\n\nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  She is a well-developed, well-nourished, very pleasant, but somewhat sad-appearing white female.  Her blood pressure is 140/60.  HEENT, pupils equal, round and reactive to light.  Extraocular movements are intact.  Throat is clear.  Neck, supple, no adenopathy or thyromegaly.  Heart, regular rate and rhythm.  Lungs, clear.  Abdomen, soft, nontender, no organomegaly.  Extremities, no edema.  Neuro, absent reflex in the right patella and 2+ in the left patella.\n\nASSESSMENT AND PLAN:\n1.  End-stage renal disease on dialysis, not considered to be a transplant candidate at this time as she has had two rejections.\n2.  Hypertension, well controlled on medications.\n3.  Hyperlipidemia, on Lipitor.  Last cholesterol was checked in 10/2086 with normal ALT and AST, but elevated alkaline phosphatase.\n4.  Peripheral vascular disease, currently asymptomatic.\n5.  Right foot-drop.  We may look into getting her another brace perhaps another consult with Dr. Yim.\n6.  Left shoulder pain.  It did mention in her physical, but she can only abduct her left shoulder to about 90 degrees without pain.  We may look into this further and perhaps get some physical therapy for possible rotator cuff tendinitis.\n7.  Hemorrhoids.\n8.  Secondary hyperparathyroidism on Sensipar.\n9.  Health maintenance.

The patient was seen and examined\n\nby me.  Please see the resident's note for details of the\n\npatient's past medical, social, family history, review of\n\nsystems, and physical exam.\n\nCHIEF COMPLAINT:  Bleeding fistula.\n\nHISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 78-year-old woman with\n\nend-stage renal disease, on hemodialysis, who is here with\n\nbleeding of her left upper arm AV fistula that she uses for\n\ndialysis that started today at dialysis.  When the patient pulled\n\nup her sleeve, she scratched herself and it began to bleed. \n\nBlood pressure is 112/60.  The bleeding can be controlled with\n\ncompression and so she presented to the Emergency Department\n\nwhere she was seen by the Internal Medicine for repair.\n\nPAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  The patient has a history of severe aortic\n\nstenosis with 0.7 cm greater diameter, mitral regurg and\n\ntricuspid regurg, end-stage renal disease on hemodialysis, PVD,\n\nfoot drop, anemia, sciatica, left thigh pain, hyperlipidemia,\n\nsecondary hyperparathyroidism, hemorrhoids, coronary artery\n\ndisease status post non-ST elevation MI, CHF with an EF of\n\n35-40%.\n\nPAST SURGICAL HISTORY:  Includes a TAH, appendectomy, cataract\n\nsurgery, ovarian cyst removal.\n\nSOCIAL HISTORY:  Never smoked, does not drink or use drugs.  She\n\nis retired, lives with her daughter who is a surgeon.\n\nFAMILY HISTORY:  Shows an extensive vascular history.\n\nREVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  Otherwise, negative.\n\nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  She is afebrile, normal and stable vital\n\nsigns.  She has bilaterally faintly scattered rales on chest\n\nexamination and she has a small laceration on the left arm over\n\nthe fistula with an excoriation and this squirting blood would\n\nnot controlled with pressure.\n\nLABORATORY DATA:  CBC is normal with a hematocrit of 43.  Chem-7\n\nis otherwise normal.  Coags reveal an INR of 1.4.  Chest x-ray\n\nshows no acute disease.\n\nEMERGENCY DEPARTMENT COURSE:  She was seen by surgery who repair\n\nher fistula.  She is due to go to dialysis now and due to sickle\n\nnature of her disease, I think it is best that she keep her\n\ndialysis appointment and so she is transferred from here with her\n\ndaughter to the EHCC Dialysis Unit to undergo full dialysis.\n\nPRIMARY DIAGNOSES:  Bleeding aVF and end-stage renal disease.\n\nDISPOSITION:  She is discharged in satisfactory condition.\n\n______________________________\n\nCORTES, ODESSA M.D.\n\nD: 04/30/90\n\nT: 04/30/90\n\nDictated By: CORTES, ODESSA\n\neScription document:5-52221754 FVQtwry\n\n ******** Not reviewed by Attending Physician ********"}

He has been experiencing increasing dyspnea with exertion over the past 5 weeks.  He has especially noted this when he climbs stairs or walking up an incline.  He also notes this SOB when he is walking the golf course. He denies any chest pain or orthopnea, although he states that he has been experiencing some \"indigestion\" the past few days.  It usually occurs in the morning. He was given sublingual nitroglycerin and notes improvement in his symptoms  His Lasix dose was increased on 4/3/96 (from 80 mg to 120 mg).  This increase did help his symptoms a little, but he still felt his exercise capacity had decreased.  \n\n\n\nAn ECHO was done on 4/10 which was not significantly changed from 1/95.  His EF was 74%, mild MR, dilated LA, symmetric LV hypertrophy without any obvious segmental wall motion abnormalities and RVSP 43 mmHg.  \n\n\n\nA Sestamibi stress test was done on 5/19.  The patient exercised for 3 minutes 21 seconds reaching 84% of predicted HR.  His EKG had STD AVF, V4-V6.  The perfusion scans showed a moderate, reversible mid-distal anterior, septal and apical defect indicative of moderate ischemia.  LV function preserved.\n\n\n\nHe was admitted electively today for further evaluation. He arrives to Internal Medicine chest pain free and hemodynamically stable.  \n\n\n\nAllergies\t\n\nNKDA\n\n\n\nPast Medical History\t\n\nHypertension\n\nHyperlipidemia\n\nDiabetes Mellitus - since 2070's\n\nAtrial Fibrillation - for 1 1/2 yrs- on chronic Coumadin- followed by FWO at VMC\n\nGout\n\nLeft Olecranon bursitis\n\nUmbilical hernia\n\nBenign Prostatic Hypertrophy- s/p TURP 3/86 at VMC (Fonseca)\n\n\n\nFamily History\t\n\nMother: Died at age 89 - \"old age\"\n\nFather: Died at age 37 with Pneumonia\n\nSiblings: one brother with DM- s/p amputation for PVD\n\n\n\nSocial History\t\n\nMarried- 4 children\n\nLives with his wife\n\nRetired claims examiner\n\n\n\n\n\nHabits\t\n\nETOH:  None\n\nTobacco: Quit in 2070's - smoked 1 ppd x 30 yrs\n\nDiet:  Poor diet habits\n\nExercise: Last 5 wks minimal exercise due to DOE- prior to that walked 2 miles, 5x/week\n\nCaffeine: 2 cups of coffee/day\n\n\n\nReview of Systems\t\n\nNeuro: No recent fever, chills, night sweats, unintentional weight loss/gain\n\nNeuro: + Labrinythitis- on Meclizine prn, No lightheadedness pre-syncope or syncope, No HA/Sz/CVA, No visual or speech changes\n\nCardiac: see HPI, denies palpatations\n\nEndo: + diabetes, no thyroid disease\n\nResp: see HPI, no SOB at rest, no orthopnea, PND, No COPD/asthma. \n\nGI: No constipation.

As you know, he is a 78-year-old gentleman who underwent coronary artery bypass grafting on 07/20/2096 and had two-vessel CABG at that time with a LIMA to mid LAD and a saphenous vein graft to the right coronary artery.  Left atrial appendage was amputated and he had a closure of a PFO as well as a CryoMAZE procedure.  The patient had symptoms of dyspnea on exertion prior to coronary artery bypass grafting.  After the coronary artery bypass grafting, he had done well but now is noting that the shortness of breath and dyspnea on exertion has recurred.  It has been progressive over the last several months.  He had been seen by GI and also by Pulmonary and has been treated for gastroesophageal reflux.  He was found to have a pleural effusion which has been drained and he has had sclerosing of that.  He has also had an admission for renal failure this spring.\n\n\n\nPast medical history:\n\n   Notable for insulin-dependent diabetes.  \n\nHypertension.  \n\nHypercholesterolemia.  \n\nHyperhomocysteinemia.  \n\nParoxysmal atrial fibrillation.  \n\nBenign prostatic hypertrophy.  \n\nGout.  \n\nRenal insufficiency.  \n\nMild thrombocytopenia.\n\n\n\nCurrent Medications:\n\n  atenolol 25 mg BID\n\n Coumadin; Dir: as directed\n\n Ecotrin 325 mg qd\n\n Lipitor 20 mg qd\n\n Lasix 120 mg qd\n\n folate 1 mg qd\n\n allopurinol 100 mg qd\n\n Ativan\n\n Proscar\n\n free text medications; Dir: Insulin\n\n Protonix\n\n\n\nAllergies:\n\nNo known drug allergy   or IV contrast dye.\n\n\n\nFamily history:\n\n   Positive for brother who is status post stent placement at the age of 78 and another brother with congestive heart failure.  There is also peripheral vascular disease and diabetes in his family.\n\n\n\nSocial history:\n\n   The patient has a 25-pack-year history of smoking, quit in 2065.  He does not drink alcohol.  He lives independently with his wife and comes to the interview with his daughter who works at Casco Bay Shipping.\n\n\n\nReview of systems:\n\n   Negative for fevers, chills, weight loss or gain.  He has not had any visual loss or hearing loss.  He denies hematochezia.  He has not had difficulty swallowing, change in bowel habits, constipation, diarrhea, or hematemesis.  He denies chest pain, PND, orthopnea, or pedal edema.  He denies dysuria or hematuria.  He has not had any rashes or poor healing wound lesions.\n\n\n\nPhysical examination:\n\n-Pulse:   55 and regular\n\n-BP: 160/80    in the right and left arm in seated position\n\n-resp. rate:   12 and unlabored\n\n-Heent:   No xanthelasma, scleral icterus, proptosis, or lid lag.  Mucous membranes are moist.  Trachea is midline\n\n-Neck:   Thyroid is not palpable.  Carotids are 2+ without bruits.  Have a normal upstroke.  JVP is less than 7 cm of water\n\n-Chest:   Clear without rales, rhonchi, or wheezes.  He does have low dullness in both bases\n\n-Cardiac:   Remarkable for well-healed midline incision of the sternum.  He has a normal S1 and S2 and a grade 1/6 holosystolic murmur radiating to the apex and a grade 1/6 high-pitched holosystolic murmur at the left sternal border which is different from the other murmur\n\n-Abdomen:   Normal bowel sounds.  No organomegaly.  No pulsatile masses\n\n-Extremities:   Peripheral pulses are 2+ and symmetric.  He has no pedal edema.  He has no clubbing or cyanosis\n\n\n\nProcedures:\n\nTc MIBI STATUS POST The patient underwent adenosine MIBI testing on.  His heart rate from 67 to 90 which was only 62% of the maximal predicted heart rate.  Peak blood pressure was 158/80.  He had no chest pain.  Nuclear imaging showed distal anterior wall and apical septal defect consistent with mild-to-moderate ischemia in that distribution.  The patient has also had an event monitor but we do not have the results of that in hand.\n\n\n\nEKG:\n\n    today shows atrial fibrillation with a fairly regular rate at about 55, leftward axis, and IVCD with nonspecific ST-T wave abnormalities.\n\n\n\nSelected recent labs:\n\n Laboratory results recently have shown plasma creatinine of 2.4, BUN of 42, hematocrit of 30.4, white count of 5.4, and platelet count of 92,000 all done on 12/22/2096 and 12/26/2096.\n\n\n\nAssessment and plan:\n\n   In summary, this is a 78-year-old gentleman who has a history of coronary artery bypass grafting, closure of PFO, and ligation of the left atrial appendage and Maze procedure which was done in July 2096. His anginal equivalent prior to that was dyspnea on exertion and he did well for a period of time but now has dyspnea on exertion again. There are a number of factors involved here. He has atrial fibrillation which is now recurrent but the rate seems to be reasonably well controlled. I doubt that, that is playing a role in his shortness of breath. He also has a history of plural effusions which could have been contributing to shortness of breath as well and that has been dealt with corrosion of the pleura. He has mitral regurgitation which in the past was said to be moderate and he has had the closure of PFO. He has insulin-dependent diabetes and hypertension. He also has low platelets. The recurrence of the exertional dyspnea is certainly worrisome for recurrence of coronary disease particularly with the exercise test showing anterior wall ischemia. It may be that there are other issues contributing to this, the atrial fibrillation and mitral regurgitation. He has murmur consistent with mitral regurgitation, but he has no evidence of decompensated congestive failure at this time. Blood pressure is elevated somewhat and I think that increase in his Avapro might be worthwhile. He also has chronic renal insufficiency which makes things more complicated as well. My feeling is that we are dealing with recurrence of coronary disease and I spoke with the patient about this. He is clearly limited in his exercise capacity and wants to have something done. I would like to get an echocardiogram to be sure we are dealing with constrictive disease, but I think he will probably need to have a cardiac catheterization. I would like to get the echocardiogram, bring him in for cardiac catheterization, and see if there are narrowings either in the graft or in his native arteries that may be contributing to the anterior wall ischemia. Starting him on an antiarrhythmic to see if we can reestablish sinus rhythm may be worth considering or perhaps cardioversion after the cardiac catheterization. Because of renal insufficiency, cardiac catheterization is a little bit more complicated and that the low platelets are also an issue we need to address.\n\n\n\nChanges to Medications this visit\n\natenolol 25 mg   BID\n\nCoumadin     as directed\n\nEcotrin 325 mg   qd\n\nLipitor 20 mg   qd\n\nLasix 120 mg   qd\n\nfolate 1 mg   qd\n\nallopurinol 100 mg   qd\n\nAtivan    \n\nProscar    \n\nfree text medications     Insulin\n\nProtonix    \n\n\n\nThank you very much for referring this very pleasant gentleman to Wayne Dental Clinic for evaluation and management of coronary disease, mitral regurgitation, PFO, atrial fibrillation, and congestive failure.  \n\n\n\nBest personal regards.  \n\n\n\nSincerely yours,\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHenry Mays MD, PhD\n\n\n\nSigned electronically by   Henry  Mays MD, PhD  on  Jan 6, 2097"}

In terms of her cardiac history, she was well\n\nuntil four years ago when she developed acute shortness of breath\n\nand was admitted to Lake Park Hospital for congestive heart\n\nfailure.  At that time, she had an exercise Thallium scan which\n\nrevealed a low work load at only 3 minutes stopping secondary to\n\nshortness of breath with a large fixed anterolateral defect and a\n\ndilated left ventricle.  In addition, she had an echo in June of\n\n2071, which shows an ejection fraction of 25% with 1+ mitral\n\nregurgitation, left atrial enlargement and diastolic dysfunction. \n\nShe has never been hospitalized since that time for her\n\ncongestive heart failure and has been treated medically with good\n\nresult. She currently denies any orthopnea, PND, angina or\n\nclaudication.  She does have chronic mild lower extremity edema.\n\nIn fact, she has never had chest pain or chest pressure to her\n\nrecollection.  She is able to walk up the 10 stairs to her house\n\nand can unload groceries from her car, up those stairs. She is\n\nable to shop, walk through the grocery store without difficulty\n\nfrom chest \n\n \n\nJorgenson, Vivian Lea\n\nMR #471-90-84-7               -2-            August 21, 2071\n\n \n\npains or shortness of breath, although she occasionally stops\n\nsecondary to fatigue.  \n\n \n\nHer past medical history includes hypertension, hyperlipidemia,\n\nCHF, chronic anxiety and this thyroid nodule. She has never had\n\nsurgery. Her family history is significant for a mother who died\n\nof myocardial infarction at the age of 55. \n\n \n\nHer social history, she smoked 1-2 packs of cigarettes a day for\n\n40 years and quit four years ago. She denies alcohol, intravenous\n\ndrugs or cocaine use.  She lives with her husband and briefly\n\nworked in Amy's Baking Company but for the past 20 years is an electrical engineer.  She\n\nhas no known drug allergies. \n\n \n\nHer current medications include Labetalol 100mg po BID, Captopril\n\n50 po TID, Digoxin 0.25mg po QD, Coumadin 5 po QD, Lipitor 10 po\n\nQD, Lasix 40 po QD, Coreg 12.5 po BID, Nitroglycerin patch daily\n\nand Gemfibrozil 600mg BID.  \n\n \n\nOn physical exam in my office, her blood pressure was 170/85 in\n\nher left arm and 165/70 in her right. Her heart rate was 104 when\n\nI saw her, although it was 80 on her EKG today. Her JVP was 7\n\ncentimeters. Her carotids were brisk upstrokes without carotid\n\nbruits. Her chest is clear to auscultation without crackles. Her\n\nheart has a non displaced PMI with a regular rate and rhythm with\n\noccasional ectopic beats. She has a normal S1 and S2 with a 2/6\n\nsystolic ejection murmur at the left upper sternal border without\n\nradiation. Her abdomen is soft with positive bowel sounds. Her\n\nextremities have 2+ distal pulses and trace peripheral edema.  \n\n \n\nHer EKG today is normal sinus rhythm at a rate of 80.  She has a\n\ndiffuse ST and T wave abnormality consistent with Digoxin\n\neffects.  She has poor R wave progression consistent with an old\n\nanterior septal MI but no acute ischemic changes.  \n\n \n\nIn summary, Ms. Jorgenson is a 64 year old woman with hypertension,\n\nhyperlipidemia and a positive family history of coronary disease\n\nwith congestive heart failure with an ejection fraction of 25%,\n\nlikely secondary to coronary disease from an anterior myocardial\n\ninfarction, although she has never undergone heart\n\ncatheterization.  She is currently undergoing evaluation for a\n\nthyroidectomy for a thyroid nodule. \n\n \n\nJorgenson, Vivian Lea\n\nMR #471-90-84-7               -3-            August 21, 2071\n\n \n\nIssue number one,  preoperative cardiovascular risk assessment: \n\ngiven that she has not had an assessment of her ischemic burden\n\nsince 2067, I have scheduled her for a repeat exercise test with\n\nimaging. If this is similar to her previous study showing only\n\nfixed defects and no reversible ischemia, then I feel that she\n\nwill be of low to moderate risk for surgery for perioperative\n\nmyocardial infarction and that her congestive heart failure is\n\nwell treated and therefore, will not preclude her from having\n\nsurgery.  \n\n \n\nIssue number two, is her anticoagulation for low ejection\n\nfraction.  She is currently on Coumadin for low ejection\n\nfraction. As far as I know, she has never had atrial fibrillation\n\nand she has never been told that she had an irregular rate or\n\nrhythm.  Therefore, I recommend that she stop her Coumadin 6 days\n\nprior to surgery and it can be restarted several days after\n\nsurgery without Heparin overlap at the discretion of the surgeons\n\nas to how may days she should wait after surgery before\n\nrestarting that medication.  She will otherwise remain on her\n\ncurrent medical regimen as determined by her cardiologist and\n\nprimary care physician, Dr. Charles Van.  If her stress test\n\nis without reversible defects, she need not follow up with me for\n\nfurther evaluation.  \n\n \n\nThank you for referring this interesting patient. She was seen\n\nand examined with Dr. Voss. \n\n \n\nSincerely, \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nPamela Imperial, M.D. \n\nPI/waldron\n\n \n\ncc:\n\nCharles Van, M.D.\n\n \n\nJordan, FL  83712\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n ******** Not reviewed by Attending Physician ********\nRecord date: 2071-11-24\n\n \n\n \n\nThyroid Division\n\nJeanes Memorial Hospital\n\n89 Buck St\n\nSioux City, FL  76546\n\n \n\n \n\nVivianLee Jorgenson\n\nMR# 471-90-84-7\n\nNovember 24, 2071\n\n \n\nThis is the first visit for Ms. Jorgenson who is a 64 year old woman who presents \n\nfor management of papillary thyroid cancer.  Her symptoms began in May, 2071, \n\nwhen she felt a prominence in her neck.  She did not experience any dysphagia \n\nor voice changes, but presumably was felt to have an abnormality on thyroid \n\nexamination.  She underwent a thyroid biopsy in June, 2071, at a local \n\nhospital.  The pathology which was read at JMH revealed numerous follicular \n\ncells with chromatin grooves suspicious for papillary carcinoma.  She was \n\nsubsequently referred to Dr. Geiger at JMH for thyroidectomy and underwent \n\nthyroidectomy on 9/17/71.  The thyroidectomy was uncomplicated though there \n\nwas inadvertent displacement of a parathyroid gland and this gland was then \n\nreimplanted.  According to the operative report, the carcinoma was felt to be \n\nlocally extensive though no laryngo-tracheal nerve invasion was present.  The \n\npathology revealed a (R) 6 cm papillary carcinoma with capsular and \n\nlymphovascular invasion.  There was an additional focus of papillary \n\ncarcinoma, follicular variant, in the (L) thyroid lobe that was 0.3 cm.   Of \n\nnote, the tissue was stained for calcitonin and this was negative.  The tumor \n\ndid stain positively for thyroglobulin.  \n\n \n\nSince undergoing thyroidectomy, Ms. Jorgenson has done fairly well.  She has been \n\nmaintained on 75 mcg daily of Levoxyl.  She says that she feels generally \n\nwell on this dose though she does endorse slight fatigue.  She denies any \n\nchanges in her sleep, hair, skin or bowels.  She does endorse a one pound \n\nweight gain over the last two months.  She denies any paresthesias or other \n\nsymptoms consistent with hypocalcemia.  She denies any history of thyroid \n\ndisturbances prior to her diagnosis of cancer.  She is now referred for \n\nconsideration of radioiodine ablation.  \n\n \n\nPast Medical History:Notable for congestive heart failure.  She has an \n\nejection fraction of 25%.  She also has a history of hypercholesterolemia, \n\nhypertension, and anxiety.  No history of childhood irradiation.  \n\n \n\nCurrent Medications:Digoxin 0.25 daily; Coreg 12.5 mg daily; Levoxyl 75 \n\nmcg daily; Lipitor 10 mg daily; Coumadin 5 mg daily; Lasix 40 mg daily; \n\ncaptopril 50 mg, tid; labetolol 100, bid; nitroglycerine.\n\n \n\nAllergies:No known drug allergies.\n\n \n\nSocial History:Remote history of tobacco.  She quit 4 years ago.  She \n\nendorses rare alcohol use.  She is married with four children.  \n\n \n\nFamily History:Negative for thyroid cancer.  \n\n \n\nPhysical Exam:Blood pressure is elevated at 188/92.  Weight 208.  Pulse \n\n88.  In general this is a somewhat tired, slightly pale-appearing woman in \n\nNAD.  HEENT:  PERRLA.  EOMI.  No proptosis or lid lag.  Neck: supple with a \n\nlarge well-healed thyroidectomy scar.

Cardiovascular: normal S1, S2, regular rate and \n\nrhythm.  Abdomen: soft, slightly distended, non-tender, moderately obese.  \n\nExtremities: trace pedal edema, 1+ distal pulses.  Neurologic: reflexes are \n\nslightly delayed.  There is no tremor of outstretched hands.  \n\n \n\nReview of Labs:Of note, include a TSH of 1.65 from August, 2071, that was \n\nprior to surgery.  Free T4 at that time was normal at 1.1.  Calcium prior to \n\nsurgery was slightly elevated at 10.6 though several calciums drawn after her \n\nsurgery were in the mid-8 range. \n\n \n\nImpression:This is a 64 year old woman with a history of congestive heart \n\nfailure who is now s/p total thyroidectomy for papillary thyroid cancer.  Ms. \n\nJorgenson is potentially at higher risk for recurrence given the fact that she is \n\nolder at the time of diagnosis, she had a large-size tumor, and she had \n\nmultifocal disease. \n\n \n\nPlan:Check a TSH and thyroglobulin today for a baseline.  We suspect that \n\nshe may be undertreated on her current dose of Levoxyl.  I have recommended \n\n131I treatment.  Benefits and risks were discussed.  In addition, I think she \n\nwould tolerate thyroid hormone withdrawal.  TSH and calcium were drawn today. \n\n \n\nWe will plan to arrange  for 131I for January. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nHilda Vincent, M.D.\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nBrittany Farrar, M.D.\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nBF/cooley\n\ncc:Aiden Geiger, M.D.\n\n \n\n \n\n_______________________________\n\nHilda Vincent\n\n \n\nDD: 11/24/71\n\nDT: 12/31/71\n\nDV: 11/24/71\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n ******** Not reviewed by Attending Physician ********\nRecord date: 2074-06-20\n\n\nHHH Cardiovascular Division\nCVD Rm 5\n89 Buck St                                      JORGENSON, VIVIANLEE\nSioux City, FL 76546                                           47190847\n(179) 732-8159                                           06/20/74\n\n\nCharles F. Van, M.D.\n66 Kessler Farm Drive, Puite #9488\nJordan, FL  83712\n\n\nDear Dr. Van:\n\nI had the pleasure of participating in the care of VivianLee Jorgenson during her recent hospitalization at Goulds Hospital.  This lovely 67-year-old female ended up having no discernable coronary artery disease on catheterization.  At the time of the cath, her pulmonary capillary wedge pressure was 12.  During the course of her hospitalization, we noted as well that she had had runs of nonsustained VT and asked our EP colleagues to comment on the appropriateness of an ICD.  They felt that this could certainly be rediscussed in the future, but at the present time, there was no compelling indication for her to receive an ICD.\n\nHer medications at discharge include Lipitor 20 mg p.o. q.d., digoxin 0.25 mg p.o. q.d., captopril 50 mg p.o. t.i.d., Lasix 40 mg p.o. b.i.d., enteric-coated aspirin 81 mg p.o. q.d., Nexium 20 mg p.o. q.d., Synthroid 300 mcg p.o. q.d., Aldactone 25 mg p.o. q.d., Coreg 25 mg p.o. b.i.d., and Norvasc 5 mg p.o. q.d.\n\nIt has been a delight to participate in the care of this lovely woman.  If there is any questions or issues, please feel free to call.\n\nSincerely,\n\n\n\n\n\n______________________________\nVickie Frank-Jarvis, M.D.\n\n\nDictated By: Vickie Frank-Jarvis\n\n\neScription document:9-9294537 RFFocus\n\n\n\nDD: 06/20/74\nDT: 06/20/74\nDV: 06/20/74\nRecord date: 2078-03-17\n\n\n\nPatient Name: JORGENSON,VIVIANLEE [ 47190847(JMH) ] Date of Visit: 03/17/2078\n\n\nCC: Syncope, Afib\n\n\nHPI: \n71 year old lady with a history of A fib was seen in clinic today for complaints of DOE and increased wt.

She presents with\n\nepisodes of gait instability, diffuse weakness, multiple falls. \n\nShe was brought in by her family for further evaluation.  She\n\nalso had dark stools over the past few weeks.  She denies any\n\nassociated chest pain, shortness of breath, lightheadedness, any\n\nsyncope, any nausea or vomiting.  She does have a bruise on her\n\nchin.  She denies any focal weakness, numbness, or tingling.  No\n\nhematuria, no epistaxis or gum bleeding.\n\nPAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Congestive heart failure, atrial\n\nfibrillation, hypertension, coronary artery disease,\n\nhypercholesterolemia, and thyroid disease.\n\nSOCIAL HISTORY:  She lives with family.\n\nREVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  As noted in the written chart and the HPI,\n\notherwise negative.\n\nMEDICATIONS:  Include ranitidine, baby aspirin, Coumadin, Lasix,\n\nand digoxin.\n\nALLERGIES:  None.\n\nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Temperature 96.5, pulse 60, respiratory\n\nrate 20, blood pressure 136/60, and oxygen 95% on room air. \n\nGeneral:  This is a pleasant female, elderly; she has got a 3-cm\n\necchymosis over her mid left chin as well as over her left\n\nshoulder.  Her pupils are reactive.  Neck is supple. \n\nRespiratory:  Clear to auscultation.  Cardiovascular:  Regular\n\nrate.  Abdomen is soft.  Rectal is heme-positive, heme-positive\n\nmelena per the resident.  Skin is otherwise with bruises over the\n\nleft arm as well as a bruise over the right thumb that appears\n\nhealing.  Extremities are with good range of motion.  No focal\n\ntenderness.  She is oriented x3.  Mood and affect are normal. \n\nShe is moving all extremities equally.\n\nLABORATORY DATA:  Chest x-ray shows no acute cardiomediastinal\n\nprocess and head CT preliminary shows no intracranial\n\nabnormalities.  Laboratory studies are remarkable for hematocrit\n\nof 16, creatinine of 1.5, BUN of 95, troponin less than 0.04, and\n\nplatelets of 358.  INR of 2.  Urinalysis with 2+ ketones, no\n\nblood.\n\nINITIAL IMPRESSION AND PLAN:  This 71-year-old female presents\n\nwith generalized weakness and gait instability and frequent\n\nfalls, concerning for either an evolving intracranial process\n\nsuch as a subdural or stroke.  This has been going on for several\n\nweeks, however, but also presents with melena over the past\n\nseveral weeks and profound anemia for which she required\n\ntransfusion in the Emergency Department.  We did order a CT of\n\nthe brain to evaluate for intracranial injury or abnormality both\n\ngiven the frequent falls and as the cause of the falls.  This\n\ndoes not show any large subdural or mass lesion.  She is quite\n\nanemic has melanotic heme-positive stool.  I suspect this is the\n\netiology, but it seems like it has been a slow progression, and\n\nconcerned given her cardiac history also the weakness and could\n\nrepresent coronary insufficiency.  She does not have an elevated\n\ntroponin at present.  She will need to be further monitored.  She\n\nwas transfused here in the Emergency Department given her\n\nprofoundly low hematocrit after consent was obtained. \n\nClinically, feels better.  I discussed with the patient's family\n\nbecause of the bleeding he will need to be evaluated as ____\n\nfurther cardiac biomarkers and further monitoring as well as\n\nphysical therapy evaluation once the patient's acute medical\n\nissues have been addressed.  She will be admitted to the medical\n\nservice with diagnosis of symptomatic anemia, gastrointestinal\n\nbleeding, congestive heart failure, and atrial fibrillation in\n\nstable condition.\n\n______________________________\n\nXUEREB, VESTER M.D.\n\nD: 05/29/78\n\nT: 05/30/78\n\nDictated By: XUEREB, VESTER\n\neScription document:9-7189367 BFFocus\n\n ******** Not reviewed by Attending Physician ********"}

This is scheduled for next week and Mr. Jarvis is quite anxious about it.  \n\n\n\nHe began the Captopril and HCTZ (? or Maxide) and has noted good blood pressure control as checked at BH.  At first he developed a considerable cough but in the last two weeks this has largely resolved.  He states that the cough is productive of thick phlegm and may reflect a respiratory infection rather than the Captopril itself.  His blood sugars when checked at home have averaged between the 140 to 150 range fasting.  On one occasion a three hour postprandial was 170.  \n\n\n\nHe has had no attacks of gout or gout like arthritis in the past six weeks and is quite pleased about this. \n\n\n\nHe has continued actively managing production and is planning a trip to Italy next month.  \n\n\n\nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  On examination today he looks well and comfortable.  His blood pressure is 140/76 right arm sitting with regular pulse of 68.  His weight is 173 (stable).  \n\n\n\nIMPRESSION:  Doing reasonably well on the new blood pressure program.  Since the cough is resolving it would seem reasonable to continue the present program.  \n\n\n\nWe will look forward to seeing the results of the prostate biopsy and we will check glucose and glycosylated hemoglobin today.  He will return in four months for follow up.  \n\n\n\n\n\nOrvell Oliver, M.D. \n\nLabs:  Hemolyzed sample shows K of 6.0.  Will check re HCTZ vs Maxide.

He is working hard as a production manager, and he will have some time off this spring.  He and his wife are \nplanning a trip to Italy and Greece, and following this, they will spend mostly \nlong weekends in New Mexico.\n\nHe has not had shortness of breath, orthopnea, or edema.  The pains in his hips \nand legs have not been bothering him.  When he tests his blood glucose level, he \ngets results that range between 170 and 120.  He has not been specifically \nexercising, but does try to park his car at some distance from shops and stores \nand walk the intervening distance.  He continues on 1/2 tablet of atenolol 50 mg \nper day along with 1 Hyzaar tablet per day.  Otherwise, the review of systems is \nunremarkable.\n\nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  He looks cheerful and fit.  Blood pressure in the \nright arm, sitting 140/86 with regular pulse 64.  Chest is clear to P&A.  Heart \nsounds are very faint, but appear normal with normal rate and rhythm.  Neck \nveins are not distended.  Abdomen is nontender.  Extremities have good dorsalis \npedis pulses.  Sensation in feet is intact to light touch and vibration.\n\nIMPRESSION:  Very stable with regards to hypertension.  He remains \nmoderately hyperglycemic.  He has an appointment to be followed by the \nurologist, Dr. Jose Quirk, in the next month for his elevated prostatic-\nspecific antigen (the prostate biopsy showed intraepithelial neoplasia   \nconsidered only a risk factor).\n\nPLAN:  We will check the usual laboratory work, and we will let him know when \nthe results are available.  He should return in 6 months.\n\n\n\n\nOrvell Oliver, M.D.\n\n\nTest Description        Result    Abnormal Flag  Ref. Range     Ref.

I think it would be wise to start on a low dose of a glucose-lowering medicine, glipizide (Glucotrol).  I would start on 1/2 of a 5 mg pill twice a day and continue checking your blood sugar levels from time to time.  If they stay a bit up, then increase to one whole pill (5 mg) twice a day.  Then we will see how that effects the blood sugar.  I don't think this will interfere with your trip.  Call me in a week to tell me how it is going.\n\n\n\nBest wishes,\n\nO\nRecord date: 2091-09-18\n\n\n\nReason for Visit\n\nMr. Amador Jarvis comes for an annual visit and physical exam, and to follow-up on his diabetes, hypertension and elevated serum creatinine\n\n\n\nProblems\n\n      Hyperexpanded lungs\n\n      Hypertension\n\n      Elevated creatinine\n\n      Elevated glucose\n\n      Elevated prostate specific antigen\n\n      Elevated cholesterol\n\n\n\nNarrative History\n\nHe has been generally healthy since last visit.

This catheterization is in preparation for planned CABG by Dr. Xaysana on 4/23/96. \n\nMr. Jarvis's cardiac history began in 12/95, when he was shoveling snow.  At that time, he developed dizziness, diaphoresis and nausea. He went inside and had an episode of syncope which lasted approximately 5 minutes. His initial EKG showed 1 mm STE in II, III and aVF and 1 mm STE in V5 and V6. An EKG seven minutes later showed an increase in STE in the inferior leads and STE in V3 to V6 with a max of 4 mm in V3. He never developed chest pain. An emergent cardiac catheterization at that time showed a left main with minor distal disease. The LAD had a proximal 80% stenosis. The LCx had mid 40% diffuse disease. The 1st OM had a tandem lesion of 90%. The RCA was large and dominant and had a proximal ulcerated 90% stenosis with haziness. Given these findings, a 2.5 X 15mm BMS was placed into the proximal RCA with and excellent result. His peak CK was 305 during that admission. An echo performed at that time was a technically difficult study, which showed diffuse inferior hypokinesis. He was discharged home in 12/95 in stable condition and follow-up with Dr. Xaysana in his office to discuss possible CABG. It was decided that the patient should have a repeat cardiac catheterization prior to the CABG to determine whether RCA restenosis is present. He is then scheduled to have CABG with Dr. Xaysana on 4/23/96. \n\nThe patient has been feeling well at home from a cardiac standpoint. He denies any chest pain, dyspnea, dizziness, pedal edema, orthopnea, PND, or syncope. He does report some bilateral thigh claudication, noting that he can walk about 0.5 miles before he has to stop secondary to leg pain. He denies any calf pain. \n\n\n\tPast medical history:\n   1.

Of note, her and her son note increasing DOE for the past 4 months and she was scheduled for outpatient TTE today.  She also reports DOE and productive cough with green- yellow sputum that has been blood tinged ever since her EGD on 7/10/91.  She also notes recent URI symptoms especially runny nose as well as diarrhea the day PTA with 6 loose BMs.  On the day prior to admission, she had drenching sweats but didn't take her temperature.  She has also had decreased po intake (though improved w/ treatment for her trigeminal neuralgia) but denies F/C/CP/abd pain/dysuria.  Her symptoms acutely worsened today such that she was in acute respiratory distress and EMS was called..\t\n\n\tEMS was called and the patient was noted to initially be speaking in full sentences but became more acutely SOB in the ambulance.  In the ED, she was afebrile but tachycardic to 120 and hypertensive at 180/80.  She initially required bipap with O2 sats of 93%.  She was given prednisone, Levaquin and nebulizers with mild improvement in her symptoms.  Of note, she was also noted to have mild ST changes on her EKG while she was tachycardic to the 120s.  She received ASA, Lopressor and Ativan and cardiac enzymes showed an elevated CK and CK-MB but negative troponin at 0.03.  Her EKG improved with rate control w/ IV Lopressor.  She was also given 30mg IV Lasix given some mild LE edema to which she put out 200cc urine.  She is now admitted to the floor for further management of her SOB.\n\n\n\nROS:   No F/C, + NS.  Improving appetite. No CP/Palpitations/Orthopnea/PND/Claudication, + LE edema for the past 1-2 months.  No N/V/D/hematochezia/melena. No delta MS/LOC. No slurring of speech, unilateral weakness. No dysuria.\n\n\n\nHospital Course: Patient had TTE performed on 7/24/91 which showed increase trans-mitral valve gradient. Given patient's history of MVR, TEE was recommended. On the night of 7/24/91, patient (who was known to sundown) tried to attack her roommate and fell on the floor hitting her head. No change in MS. In the setting of being on coumadin, patient had a stat CT of the head done which was negative for bleeds. On 7/25/91, patient went down for a TEE but desated to 80s and the procedure was aborted. Dr. Janssen then decided to perform cardiac cath on the patient Saturday 7/28/91. On 7/26/91, decision was made to put her on BIPAP for the night, and the patient did well and felt rested the next morning. On 7/27/91, because patient looked so well, she was not put on BIPAP but rather only on O2NC for the night. This AM, patient's respiratory status declined satting in the low 90s while on O2 6LNC.

Per pt and her son, for the past few wks pt has been feeling tired, with some minimal weight gain and ankle swelling.  Approximately 7-10 days prior to admission, pt given azithromycin for increased cough and COPD.  In addition, 8 days prior to admission, pt's regular lasix dose was increased from 80 to 120 mg for four days, then reduced back to 80 mg.  On the night prior to admission, pt was in the kitchen, leaning on the counter top, feeling hot and tired when as she was turning to walk back to bed, she began to fall back.  Her son, who was in the room, was able to catch her before she actually fell.  He reports that she seemed awake but was not responding.  There was no sz like activity, no bowel or urinary incontinence.  Pt was out for approx 30-45 seconds when she came to.  She does not remember going down.  She denies any auras before going down, no chest pain, no palpitations, no increased SOB.  No recent fevers, abdom pain or diarrhea.  Her son called EMT and she was brought in to PHH.\n\n\n\nED Course:  initial vitals 140/66 78  18  98.0 .  She received an aspirin along with many of her home meds, CXR c/w pulmonary congestion.

In addion, pt could have had an arrythmia which would necessitate interrogating her pacer.  Seizure activity is not part of the hx but the pt does have carotid disease which might have been playing a role as well.\n\n--will check echo in a.m. to assess valvular disease, LV function, could consider stress test\n\n--will consult EP to assess pacer function\n\n--pt has already ruled out for MI but will keep her on monitor at least overnight\n\n--will need to pay close attention to volume status as pt is very preload dependent \n\n--will re-check carotid studies\n\n--will re-start ASA (it was recently stopped) given carotid and vascular disease\n\n\n\n2.

She had a mitral valve replacement with the St. Jude's valve and septal myomectomy in 2085. Because of thrombosis of the valve with recurrent heart failure, she had a redo mitral valve replacement complicated by sinus arrest and AV nodal block requiring a permanent pacemaker.  She also had several episodes of syncope, once after taking an additional dose of Lasix and another in the setting of over diuresis. Repeat echo showed that her AS was not critical and she had significant LV outflow tract obstruction.\n\n\t\t\t\n\nOther medical problems include severe COPD, trigeminal neuralgia, ruled out for temporal arteritis by several biopsies, R hip osteonecrosis, and bone spur of the right shoulder. Mrs. Mitchell is S/P total hip replacement surgery, and had her rehab atNorth Mountain Hospital. She had intercurrent admissions for overdiuresis and for flash pulmonary edema with over- and under-diuresis, respectively. She currently takes Bumex 6 mg po bid, and with this, her weight has been 140-145 pounds, which is her target weight. Her BUN and Cr are in the 25-40/1.3-1.7 range. \n\n\n\nSince her last visit, she has done well at home. Her breathing at home is intermittently difficult, especially if she rushes. However, oximetry shows that she is in the mid 90's at rest, and that she drops down to high 80's to 90 with exertion. She has had GI evaluation for anemia in the past, only revealing diverticulosis; her Hct was 28 recently, and Dr. Conway arranged for her to udnergo transfusion of one unit of PRBC. She feels more energetic after this. She takes Fe sulfate, but has some constipation from this.\n\n\n\nShe may require ENT surgery for vocal cord growth by Dr. Cherry. This is being considered in consultation with her LMD Dr. Evelyn Conway, and her pulmonologist Dr. Geoffrey Lucas.\n\n\n\nMedications (Confirmed):\n\n\t\t\t\n\nAdvair 500/50mcg spray inh bid\n\nAmbien 5 mg po qhs\n\nBumex 4 mg po bid\n\nColace 100 mg po tid\n\nFosamax 70mg po qwk\n\nLescol 40mg po qhs\n\nmetoprolol 100 mg po tid\n\nMiraLax 17 g 2 po qhs\n\nNexium 40mg po qd\n\nPaxil 10mg po qd\n\nPlavix 75mg po qd\n\nSpiriva 18mcg/capsule inh qd\n\nverapamil hydrochloride, SR (extended release) 120mg SR po qd\n\nZyrtec 10mg po qd\n\n\n\nAllergies:\n\nPenicillin allergy   angioedema\n\nAllergic drug reaction   percodan, bactrim, pseudophed, leading to angioedema\n\nHeparin induced thrombocytopenia   HIT\n\n\n\nFamily history:\n\n   negative for CAD\n\n\n\nSocial history:\n\n   son Bobby (retired Secondary School Teacher) now lives with her\n\nsister lives on Chipley (near Eagle Pass)\n\ngod-daughter Bethany lives nearby\n\n\n\n\n\nReview of systems:\n\n   all systems reviewed. except as noted above, noncontributory.\n\n\n\nPhysical examination:\n\n-BMI: 27.1  Overweight, moderate risk\n\n-Pulse: 60  \n\n-resp. rate: 12  \n\n-height: 61  in.\n\n-weight: 143  lbs.\n\n-General appearance:   No acute distress.\n\n-Skin:   No rashes, anicteric.\n\n-Heent:   EOM full, PERRL\n\n-Neck:   Carotids 2+ with bruits greater on right than left.

For the month prior to the onset of diarrhea she reports that she had been constipated.  No fevers or chills; patient is afebrile and the WBC is not elevated.  Her abdominal exam is remarkable for obesity, tympany and mild LLQ tenderness.  Finding of air in the gastroepiploic and portal vessels with no associated intraabdominal pathology is of uncertain significance.  Fibroids, which have been previously diagnosed, are seen.  Normal colonoscopy 08/20/2076.\n\n\n\n1) GI:  Constipation for a month followed by diarrhea for two weeks.  This history is suggestive of overflow diarrhea.  Patient denies recent narcotic usage and no obstructing lesions are seen on CT scan.  May also be infection, malabsorption, osmotic, inflammatory, secretory or a motility defect.  No evidence is seen for ischemia, inflammation or infection.  Bowel dysmotility resulting from DM may play a role in a motility disorder.\n\n - Diet: clears now, NPO after midnight\n\n - Stool for fecal leukocytes, O&P, C. diff\n\n - Bowel regimen:  colace, senokot, miralax\n\n - Reglan PRN nausea\n\n- Follow clinical exam\n\n - Follow WBC, T, lactate for signs of acute sepsis or ischemia\n\n - Appreciate GI input (Dr. Utterback)\n\n - Apprecate surgery input (Dr. Espinosa)\n\n - Ranitidine prophylaxis, zofran PRN nausea\n\n\n\n2) Gyn:  Patient is s/p breast cancer and has fibroids.

She was seated at breakfast this AM when she developed sudden onset ripping chest pain which radiated &#8220;like a knife&#8221; to her upper back.  It was associated with nausea but no vomiting or diaphoresis or shortness of breath.  It did radiate down both arms, but she her arm pains are now new.  It was not relieved by any positioning, or largely affected by taking deep breaths.  It tapered off over about 20 minutes.  She felt fatigued and layed down, when it occurred again several hours later, again lasting for about 20 minutes.  She then presented to DCA-ED for evaluation.  She had a negative adenosine MIBI at JMH in 2078.\n\n\n\nShe has had a difficult time recently, she is under evaluation for a lupus-like syndrome (she has noted positivity for ANA, anti-smith, anti-dsDNA).  She has had progressive joint and muscle pain of all of her major joints (ankes, knees, hips, wrists, elbows, shoulders, neck, lumbar back) and the muscles of her arms and legs.  She endorses progressive mental &#8220;cloudiness&#8221;, frequently dropping items like cutlery and cups, and increasing tremor in her hands.\n\n\n\nDCA ED Course:\n\nInitial EKG NSR without ischemic changes\n\nInitial biomarkers strongly positive with CKMB 33 and Troponin 0.36.  CXR unremarkable.\n\nShe was treated for NSTEMI with ASA 325 mg X 1, heparin gtt, IV lopressor.\n\nShe had a brief episode of CP which was relieved by SL NTG and morphine.\n\nShe was sent to SDU for further evaluation and treatment. \n\n\n\nROS (positive findings denoted)\n\nConstitutional: fatigue\n\nHead/Eyes: occ dizziness\n\nENT/Neck: URI sx two weeks ago, chronic neck pain\n\nChest/Respiratory: See HPI\n\nGI/Abdominal: denies\n\nCardiovascular: See HPI\n\nMusculoskel/Extr/Back: See HPI\n\nNeuro: See HPI\n\n\n\nMEDICAL HISTORY\n\nHx of pancreatitis\n\nQuestion of SLE; (+) ANA, dsdna, smith; \n\nBreast ca \n\n-                    s/p bilateral mastectomies w/positive nodes\n\n-                    s/p chemoradiation on femara\n\nDepression and anxiety\n\nT2DM; insulin-requiring\n\nHyperlipidemia\n\nh/o back pain\n\nh/o ear infection s/p Augmentin \n\n\n\nFAMILY HISTORY\n\nMom: stroke, CAD/CABG\n\nDad: CAD/CABG, DM, lymphoma\n\n\n\nSOCIAL HISTORY\n\nLives with 90 yo mother and cousin.\n\nEtoh - denies\n\nTobacco &#8211; &#189; PPD, down from &gt; 2 ppd.\n\nDrugs - denies\n\n\n\nALLERGIES: \n\nTricyclic Antidepressants - cough, \n\nSulfa - Rash, \n\nEZETIMIBE - lethargy, GI Intolerance\n\n\n\nMEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION\n\n  1.

Cardiac RF = age, DM, HL, active smoking.  TIMI score = 3 (age, asa use, + biomarkers).  DDx = ACS (high risk NSTEMI), aortic dissection (concerning elements of hx), PE (given cancer hx, on SERM), or perimyocarditis (question associated with lupus-like condition).  The lack of hypoxia or tachycardia argue against PE.  Given her risk factors, after exoneration of her aorta by CT scan, she should undergo cardiac catheterization to assess for epicardial disease.  She is currently CP free.\n\n\n\n1.

The patient was in his usual state of compensated health, but approximately one month ago after clearing significance note from his driveway, the patient started to note some anterior chest discomfort.  He has a long history of coronary artery disease and this includes angioplasty and coronary artery bypass grafting in 2065.  The pain did not radiate up to his neck or arm, but when the pain persisted even after returning from Blountstown, he went to Roper Hospital North two days ago because of his chest discomfort to see his cardiologist.  He was admitted to the hospital, had a cardiac catheterization, which according to the patient did not show any specific lesion.  The doctors felt that he did not have a myocardial infarction, but that in fact his abnormality was due to a chest wall/muscular type syndrome.  He was discharged on anti-inflammatory medicine and the patient had noted that when he took the aspirin over the past month, his discomfort was improved.  The patient states that he had the chest x-rays at the hospital and in fact also had a CT scan, which did not show any pulmonary embolism.  It also did not show any dissecting aneurysm according to the patient.\n\n\nLeft renal lesion.  As part of his routine workup, the patient did have a CT scan and this identified some left kidney mass possibly on this scan.  The patient denies specifically any flank pain or any bleeding and he has no recent weight loss.  I spoke to the patient at length about this matter and he will consult with Dr. Jung, the urologist at Roper Hospital North.\n\n\nDiabetes mellitus type 2.  The patient remains on his usual medicines and according to him, his hemoglobin A1c and blood sugars have remained fairly satisfactory.\n\n\nObstructive sleep apnea.  The patient does not use his mask and I cautioned him to get back using that, as this may have an effect on his coronary artery disease.\n\n\nAbnormal liver function tests, has been present for many years and previously was thought to be due to a fatty liver.\n\n\nElevated blood pressure.  The patient was noted in the hospital to have elevated blood pressures despite his medicine and he was asked to increase his Norvasc from 5 mg to 10 mg per day.\n\n\nGastroesophageal reflux.  The patient feels well on Zantac.\n\n\nREVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  Reveals no specific headaches.  He denies any trouble with his ears, nose or throat.  He has no chronic cough or coughing blood.  He denies any nausea, vomiting, black or bloody stool.  He has no burning on urination.\n\n\nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Revealed a pleasant white male in no acute distress.  His blood pressure was 130/90, pulse was 60 and weight 207 pounds.  Head, ears, eyes, nose and throat were normal.  The neck showed no thyroid nodes or tenderness.  The chest did show a healed coronary artery bypass graft scar, but he did have chest wall discomfort to palpation in the costochondral area on the left.  The lungs were clear to percussion and auscultation.  Heart showed a regular sinus rhythm.  Abdomen is soft.  No liver or spleen was felt.  Extremities showed no cyanosis, clubbing or edema.  Neurologically, the patient was alert.\n\n\nThe patient was also sent to the office for evaluation because of his kidney function and the use of the scan during the CT scanning and use of the diet.\n\n\nThe patient was therefore ordered to have routine laboratory test including complete blood count, CBC, chem profile, lipid profile, urinalysis and I did a hemoglobin A1c because of his history of diabetes.\n\n\n1.  Chest pain, probably due to chest wall rather than coronary artery disease according to the patient's history.\n2.  New discovery of left renal mass to consult with Urology, Dr. Jung.\n3.  Renal function to be rechecked secondary to his CT scanning and history of diabetes with Glucophage, which he has restarted.\n4.  Status post coronary artery bypass graft.\n5.  Abnormal LFTs by history.\n6.  Diabetes mellitus.\n7.  Obstructive sleep apnea.\n\n\nWill follow up with the patient by phone tomorrow regarding his lab tests and also he will consult with Dr. Jung and has a followup appointment with me for comprehensive exam in one to two months.\n\n\n\n\n______________________________\nTodd Brandt, M.D.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\neScription document:0-0901410 CSSten Tel\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDD: 03/31/68\nDT: 03/31/68\nDV: 03/31/68\nRecord date: 2068-12-12\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEudowood Services Physician Group\n128 Williams Ct              M OSCAR, JOHNNY\nHyderabad, WI  62297                    76324418\n547-598-7353                     12/12/2068\n\n\n\n\nHISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 59-year-old white male who comes to the office for reevaluation regarding his diabetes.  He also has high blood pressure and coronary artery disease.\n\n\nDiabetes.  The patient is trying to adhere to his diet.  He stays on his usual medicines, which include Glucophage and glyburide.  He takes an aspirin regularly and he is on his blood pressure medicines.  He does not smoke.  He follows closely his foot regimen and had not noticed any difficulty.  He sees a foot doctor.  He has not seen an eye doctor recently.  He has not been to the Jay Hospital for his routine followup and says he will start setting up appointments with the diabetes group out in Littleton, Wisconsin where he lives.  The patient specifically denies any increased thirst or urination.  His blood sugars taken at home are approximately 140-160 on a fasting basis.  He has not had any episodes of hypoglycemia.\n\n\nCoronary artery disease.  The patient is also followed by Dr. Garza.  He does stay on his Plavix and aspirin and also is on other medicines including atenolol, hydrochlorothiazide, Norvasc, Vasotec and he has not needed any nitroglycerin.  He still does complain of some nonspecific chest type discomfort for which he was evaluated by Dr. Garza last spring.  He had a cardiac catheterization.\n\n\nElevated cholesterol.

It appears that she had been having a several-month history of anginal-type symptoms, although a stress test obtained in March showed no significant ischemia.  On 04/09/2076 she was in New York helping a family member with start up of a restaurant, when she woke up in the morning with a sudden onset of chest discomfort and lightheadedness, and according to her daughter suffered a cardiac arrest.  She was taken emergently to Cabrini Medical Center where she was found to have an inferior wall myocardial infarction and underwent coronary stenting.  I do not have records from this admission that she does have her stent cards that indicate that she received a 3.5 x 23 and 3.5 x 13 Cypher drug-eluting stents to the right coronary artery.  Per her daughter's report, she had a significant lesion in another blood vessel, which was felt to require percutaneous coronary intervention.  Unfortunately, we do not have details of the remainder of her coronary anatomy.\n\n\nSince her myocardial infarction, she actually has felt quite well.  She no longer has the angina that she had prior to her MI.  Her major complaints are that she occasionally feels lightheaded and somewhat fatigued but overall feels well.  She is able to walk normal distances without cardiac symptoms.\n\n\nHer past medical history is notable for hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and glucose intolerance.\n\n\nHer present medications include aspirin 325 mg a day, Plavix 75 mg a day, metformin 500 mg a day, simvastatin 40 mg a day, nitroglycerin p.r.n., amlodipine 10 mg a day, hydrochlorothiazide 25 mg a day, and lisinopril 20 mg a day.\n\n\nShe has no known drug allergies.\n\n\nSocial History:  She is married and has three children.  She is presently accompanied by her daughter Landis who handles the majority of her health care.  Landis can be reached on a cell phone at 944-351-0904.  She has never used tobacco.\n\n\nFamily history is notable for several aunts with myocardial infarctions and a sister whose has had a prior stroke.  There was a significant history of glucose intolerance in the family.\n\n\nReview of Systems:  Cardiac:  No chest pain, PND, orthopnea, dyspnea, or lower extremity edema.  Musculoskeletal:  No myalgias or arthralgias on lipid-lowering therapy.  All others are negative.\n\n\nOn physical examination, she is an overweight yet well-appearing female in no apparent distress.  Her blood pressure is 131/86 and her heart rate is 61 beats per minute.  Her weight is 213 pounds.  Her neck shows 2+ carotid upstrokes.  There is a hint of a bruit in the left carotid.  The carotid upstrokes are full.  Her lungs are clear to auscultation.  The heart is normal to palpation, no thrills are palpated and the PMI is nondisplaced.  The heart is regular in rate and rhythm and a 2/6 systolic ejection murmur is heard best in the right upper sternal border throughout the precordium.  The abdomen is obese, soft, nontender with normal bowel sounds.  Her extremities show no edema.\n\n\nHer EKG in the office today shows normal sinus rhythm at a rate of 61 with a normal axis and intervals.  She has Q waves and T-wave inversions in leads III and F consistent with her recent myocardial infarction.\n\n\nI do not have a recent lipid profile on file.\n\n\nOn 04/16/2076, she underwent an echocardiogram.  She has normal left ventricular function with a mild intracavitary gradient of 9 mmHg.  She has mild aortic sclerosis with a velocity across the aortic valve of 2.2 m/sec.  There are no significant wall motion abnormalities.  She has only mild mitral regurgitation.\n\n\nIn summary, well we do not have records, it is fairly clear that Mrs. Preston has had an inferior wall myocardial infarction treated with coronary stenting.  She did receive drug-eluting stents.  The good news is that appears that her left ventricular function is very well preserved suggesting that she did not have a large myocardial infarction.  What is less clear, however, is the status of her other coronaries, there is some suggestion that she may have significant coronary artery disease at this time.\n\n\nFrom a clinical standpoint, I certainly do not think that she requires a cardiac catheterization at this time.  She is fairly asymptomatic, and is doing well from the cardiovascular standpoint.  I think what would be more helpful in guiding recommendation is whether she has significant underlying ischemia at this point.  To this end, I have arranged for her to undergo an adenosine PET scan to assess for residual ischemia.  We will guide our recommendations regarding cardiac catheterization based on the results of the study.\n\n\nIn terms of her lipids, it appears that she has been switched to Lipitor.  The goal for her LDL should be in the 70s and her HDLs ideally be in the 40s.\n\n\nIn terms of antithrombotic therapy, she did receive drug-eluting stents.  Therefore, she should certainly remain on aspirin for the remainder of her life and Plavix for an absolute minimum of one year.  After a year, it would likely be acceptable for her to stop her Plavix for brief periods of time should it be necessary for other medical procedures.  However, up until that time her Plavix should not be discontinued without a discussion with myself.\n\n\nShe is on a very good medical regimen, although I think she would benefit from a beta-blocker.  The hydrochlorothiazide appears to be a new medication for her, and therefore I went ahead and discontinued this and started her on extended-release metoprolol at 25 mg a day.  This can certainly be cut uptitrated for better blood pressure control.\n\n\nI will call her daughter Landis with the results of her PET scan and further recommendations, and we will go ahead and make plans for her to see me again in six months.\n\n\nThank you for allowing me to participate in her care.  If you have any further questions regarding her management, do not hesitate to contact me.\n\n\n\n\n______________________________\nCorrie Q Newland, MD\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\neScription document:3-6567539 IFFocus\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDD: 04/19/76\nDT: 04/20/76\nDV: 04/19/76\nRecord date: 2076-12-15\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPRESTON, FRANCES\n05850080\n12/15/2076\n\n\n\n\nLouis Barron, M.D.\nShelby Dental Care Center\n9842 Edwards Street\nCozad, OK  53952\n\n\nDear Dr. Barron:\n\n\nI would like to give you followup on our mutual patient Frances Preston.  As you know, I referred her to the cardiac catheterization laboratory because of progressive worsening angina and a stress test suggesting anterior ischemia.  We performed a catheterization on 12/14/2076.  We utilized the right radial artery for access.  We found that she developed a significant in-stent restenosis lesion within the previously placed Cypher drug-eluting stent.  This is undoubtedly the cause of her symptoms.  We were able to treat this lesion with balloon angioplasty and ultimately stented with a 3.5 x 24 Taxus drug-eluting stent.  The stent was postdilated with a 4 mm noncompliant balloon to high pressure.  The final angiographic result was excellent.\n\n\nThe following morning she was doing quite well and we discharged her later in the day.  She will remain on her usual medications and I have stressed the importance of remaining on aspirin once a day for the remainder of her life and Plavix for a minimum of a year after this procedure, though I will likely favor indefinite therapy.\n\n\nI plan on seeing her again on 01/24/2077 in followup.  If you have any further questions regarding her care, please do not hesitate to contact me.\n\n\nSincerely,\n\n\n\n\n______________________________\nCorrie Q Newland, MD\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\neScription document:0-3743412 IFFocus\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDD: 12/15/76\nDT: 12/15/76\nDV: 12/15/76"}

Previously followed by Dr. Faust, but daughter needs closer PCP. In addition, patient followed in arthritis clinic by Dr. Solomon and has received injections per patient report from severe muscle spasms of both arms. Also seen by pain clinic. Main issue is continued lower back pain and primary care. Of concern is patient reveals an unclear history of chest pain which was thought to be arthritis, but is accompanied by episodes of syncope, witnessed in a grocery store. Patient has not had to her knowledge a cardiac workup for this. Also had some vascular studies done at that time and was told they were normal. The patient is unclear on status of recent pelvic exam. GYN - G7, P7, still with uterus but not sexually active. Denies any change in bowels. Denies any change in appetite. \n\n\n\nThe patient has been complaining of animals crawling across her chest. States she used a cream for 1 week with resolution but now feels the animals are back, and she has been using a pesticide agent which sounds like a Kwell agent to resolve these. \n\n\n\nRecent testing - L-spine films confirm grade 2 anterospondylolisthesis L4-L5 with disc space changes at L1-L2. Negative allergy testing. 1/1 immune globulin testing significant for an IgG of 15/40 and positive ANA at 1:40 and 1:60. MRI of spine 12/93 shows degenerative changes of lumbar spine.

Carotid ultrasound done 12/93 shows minimal disease of right and left carotid bifurcations. TCDs 12/93 suggest a stenosis of the left vertebral artery with an RVA WNL. Velocity suggests a mild stenosis. EKG 12/93 shows sinus brad with an LAE. No other significant changes. Nonspecific ST changes. \n\n\n\nO:\tHEENT - Unremarkable. Skin - No obvious sign of rash or infection where she states the animals are present. CV - BP is 170/88. RR at 60. No murmurs, gallops, rubs present. Lungs - Clear to P&A. B12 was 331. Attempted Pap smear. External genitalia unremarkable. Vaginal introitus is very small. Patient got very cold and clammy and nervous throughout the tried Pap smear; so Pap smear attempt was terminated at that time. Consent was obtained to conduct Pap smear. Lungs - Clear to P&A. \n\n\n\nA/P:\t(1)\tDizziness of unclear etiology. Neuro consult had been done when the patient was hospitalized, and meclizine has not been of any benefit.

Patient has returned from her trip to Hong Kong.  Says\n\nthat it was a bit stifling, because she cannot drive and was dependent on other people\n\nfor transportation.\n\n\n\nStill has severe right shoulder pain.  Still also complaining of left jaw pain, that is\n\nworse when she has to open her mouth very widely.  Reviewed x-rays, which were\n\nnegative for fracture of frontal facial bones, and did not reveal obvious abnormality in\n\nthe TMJ area.  Has yet to receive an appointment from Dr. Vann for this\n\nshoulder pain.\n\n\n\nPatient was afraid to try the Vioxx, because she was told by the pharmacist that she\n\ncould not take it with ibuprofen. I explained to her that she should take the Vioxx in\n\nplace of the ibuprofen and she understands.  Is not willing to try Flexeril. \n\n\n\nPatient spent approximately 20 minutes describing her dissatisfaction and difficult\n\ninteractions with her children.  Has not asked for more Valium.  Has never been\n\ninterested in counseling prior to today.  Did not become tearful like she has in the\n\npast.  \n\n\n\nAsked for refill of sublingual nitroglycerin.  Prescription apparently was given to her\n\nlast spring.  Complains also of upper chest wall tenderness.  No clear to me what\n\ncauses her to take the sublingual nitroglycerine, but says when she takes it, it relieves\n\nher symptoms.  I have asked her if this pain is ever exertional, or is the same pain\n\nthat is reproducible when she touches her chest.  The patient seems to label her chest\n\nwall pain as the same as pain that she gets with exertion.  \n\n\n\nPROBLEMS: As per LMR.\n\n\n\nMEDICATIONS: As per LMR.\n\n\n\nALLERGIES: As per LMR.\n\n\n\nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION: WD/WN female in NAD. Blood pressure 150/80.\n\nPulse 80 and regular.  Weight 152 pounds.  Lungs: Clear bilateral breath sounds. \n\nCOR: RRR. S1 and S2 without murmurs noted.  Extremities: No lower extremity\n\nedema.  Soreness over posterior right upper trapezius.  Full range of motion of\n\nshoulders. No tenderness over AC joints.  Chest wall tenderness over superior aspect\n\nof sternum and its border on left.  No masses or deformity noted.\n\n\n\nASSESSMENT AND PLAN:  \n\n\n\n(1)  Chest pain: Certainly overdue for a follow-up with her cardiologist, Dr. Hunter\n\n     Mccarthy.  Referral done.  Also referred sublingual nitroglycerin.\n\n\n\n(2)  Elevated blood pressure.  Better than last visit, but remains slightly elevated. \n\n     At last visit, patient was reluctant to start a beta blocker.  Think she may need\n\n     this at future visit.  Will also refer back to her cardiologist.\n\n\n\n(3)  Elevated lipids, last checked last year. Several medications that patient appears\n\n     to be sensitive to side effects.  At next visit, will give lab slip to repeat fasting\n\n     profile. Positive checkup.  Would probably benefit from lipid lowering.\n\n\n\n(4)  Leg cramps.  Toward end of visit, patient also complained of more than 25\n\n     years of leg cramps.  Unable to take quinine because of allergic reaction. \n\n     Patient already takes Valium p.r.n. and I am reluctant to start any other\n\n     anxiolytics.  Will check electrolytes and calcium at next visit. \n\n\n\n(5)  History of sciatica.  Patient states in past that she has received steroid injection\n\n     for her lower back pain, which resolved.  Will simply follow with Vioxx, which\n\n     will hopefully help other pains that patient is experiencing.  Also continue with\n\n     her rheumatologist, Dr. Solomon, who has followed her chronic fibromyalgia and\n\n     chronic low back pain.\n\n\n\nReturn to clinic with me in six to eight weeks. \n\n\n\nADDENDUM: Patient's referral was receiving by Dr. Vann's office and they tell\n\nme she should be able to get an appointment for 6/95.  \n\n\n\nHelen Whitehead, M.D.\n\n\n\nHW/warren/stark\nRecord date: 2095-12-07\n\n\n\n\nNAME:     Upham, Zelda\nMRN:      0308696\n\nThe patient is here for a scheduled visit, status post hospitalization for emergent\nbypass surgery.  She is late for the visit.  She is accompanied by her daughter,\nQazi.  The patient denies chest pain and has done quite well, based on reports\nfrom her rehab stay at the Miller County Hospital.  Currently complaining of\nleft-sided chest wall pain. No exertional chest pain and no shortness of breath.  Has\nan appointment pending with her cardiologist tomorrow.  Also has an appointment\npending with surgeon Dr. Weeks for 12/13/95. Has been compliant with\nmedications.  \n\nThe patient's daughter is concerned that the patient is not eating enough.  Has lost\nsignificant weight since hospitalization.  Patient did agree that she has been watching\nwhat she eats because she did not want to gain much weight.  Explained to her the\nimportance of proper nutrition and getting back her strength.  \n\nAsked if she can use an OTC pain patch called Salonpas. Says that the chest wall\ntenderness is very different from any exertional chest pain that she may have had in\nthe past.  Would like some relief for this.  Uses it on her knees and finds it helpful\nfor the arthritic knee pain. \n\nEmotionally, the patient did admit to feeling depressed and did become tearful\nduring the visit. \n\nPROBLEMS: See extensive LMR list. \n\nMEDICATIONS:  See LMR list. \n\nALLERGIES:  Sulfa, Percocet and quinine. \n\nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION: Well-appearing female. Vital signs: WNL, as per flow\nsheet. Lungs: Clear with rales. COR: RRR, S1 and S2 without murmurs noted. \n\nASSESSMENT:\n\n(1)  CAD: The patient is also on a cholesterol-lowering agent, but will update list\n     at next visit.  Keep appointment with cardiologist. \n\n(2)  Chest wall tenderness status post CABG: Tried to encourage patient that there\n     will be some persistent discomfort in her wound for several months.  Told her\n     to hold off on using the OTC pain patch until I can verify the ingredients. \n\n(3)  Depressed mood status post surgery: Refuses referral to Mental Health. Not\n     suicidal. Encouraged patient to eat more regularly. \n\n(4)  Return to clinic for follow-up in two weeks.  \n\nThis visit lasted for 35 minutes, half of which was spent trying to counsel the patient\nto obtain proper nutrition and to go to Mental Health.  I was unsuccessful in\nconvincing her to attend a Mental Health session. \n\nHelen Whitehead, M.D.\n\nHW/warren/stark\nRecord date: 2097-08-18\n\n\n\nMSH Adult Medicine Office Visit                              PCP Dr Whitehead\n\n\n\n73 yr old woman with HTN, SP CABG, fibromyalgia comes in for follow up of renal MRA done for evaluation of renal insufficiency and associated high K.\n\nShe was hospitalized in 7/97 for a fairly acute deterioration of renal function and hyperkalemia.

She is now 52 and\nhas long-standing insulin dependant diabetes with a h/o retinopathy\nOS, possible peripheral neuropathy but not known nephropathy.  She\nhad a maximal negative exercise test in 2059 and has felt generally\nwell since that time.  Over the past year she has not been as\ncareful as previously with her diet and has not been checking her\nsugars regularly.  A random cholesterol w/i the past year was over\n300.\n     She has intermittently had sharp, brief discomforts of the\nanterior chest lasting only seconds and not accompanied by dyspnea,\ndiaphoresis or light-headedness.  There has not been any reduction\nin her physical capacity, in fact, she feels stronger than a year\nago and is working full-time.  There has been no orthopnea, PND or\nperipheral edema.  She is interested in increasing her physical\nactivity program.\n     Cardiac risk factors include remote smoking, stopped by age\n20, hypercholesterolemia and family history in that her father\ndeveloped coronary disease possibly in his 50's.  She is\nperimenopausal and has discussed later estrogen usage with her\ngynecologist Dr. Bradley Brandt.\n     Her only medication is lente insulin taken twice per day.\n \nEXAM\n     She is comfortable at rest.  BP 110/76, HR 80 and reg.  No\nJVD.  Carotids full w/o bruits.  Chest clr.  Cardiac exam shows\nnormal heart sounds w/o gallop or murmur.  Abd. soft w/o\norganomegaly.  No peripheral edema.\n     Resting EKG shows sinus rhythm with normal intervals and axis\nand is a normal tracing.\n     For further evaluation of her chest discomforts and to help\ngauge her exercise program an exercise treadmill test was performed\nusing the standard bruce protocol.  She exercised for 9 minutes, 8\nseconds and stopped because of knee discomfort but not because of\nchest pain or inordinate dyspnea.  Peak heart rate was 143 (85%\nmaximal predicted) with an appropriate rise in systolic pressure. \nThere were no diagnostic changes of ischemia at this good work\nload.  Compared to the test of 9/15/59 she exercised 1 minute, 4\nseconds longer.\n \nIMPRESSION\n     1.  No evidence of clinical coronary disease at this time. \nShe has major risk factors of insulin dependant diabetes,\nhypercholesterolemia, family h/o coronary disease and a\nperimenopausal state.  She will be seeing Dr. David Yun as\nher primary care provider, and would urge that a fasting lipid\nprofile be obtained and that dietary/pharmacologic therapy be \nPAGE 2\nUHER,OLGA\n12/31/63\n \n \ninstituted to achieve an LDL cholesterol <130.  From a cardiac\nstandpoint, post-menopausal estrogen therapy would be desired.  Low\ndose aspirin therapy could also be considered.\n     I would be happy to see Ms. Uher for additional cardiac\nevaluation as needed in the future.\n \nREFERRING MD\ncc:  David Yun, M.D.\n \n \n \nIvan M.

Unfortunately she missed her\nentire appointment and did not bring her blood glucose log with\nher. She reports that at 4 a.m. last Thursday she woke up and felt\ndisoriented with sweats. She checked her blood glucose, it was 50,\nand she treated herself by eating. This led to resolution of her\nsymptoms, although she said that she overshoots. She has developed\na foot infection, has been seen by a podiatrist and started on\nantibiotics. She has also been taking a thyroid hormone but she\nstill feels that it is making her tired.

A head MRI was reportedly normal. She improved and was discharged without treatment or diagnosis. At that time she also noticed subtle decline in visual acuity and eye exam confirmed this. She was told that this was caused by her diabetes. Her vision continued to worsen and she was treated with laser OS. Over the past month her balance has worsened nad her vision has continued to deteriorate. She reports severe HA in 8/70 but none recently.

She is actually in the process of moving. \nShe recognizes that she is improving, and is very excited\nabout the fact that, during the course of the week, she went\nout to Sel de la Terre, and also went through a movie with her\nfriend.  \n\nHer sugars are still not well controlled.  She has been\nliberalizing her diet, which I thought was appropriate.  I\ndid increase her morning insulin to 20 units of 30/70, and\nsuggested that she change from five units of NPH at bedtime\nto 8 units of 30-70, taken with her supper, to try to give\nher a little better coverage for her evening meal.  I wrote\na note to the nurse to actuate this change.  They actually\ncalled me later in the evening, on page, and I discussed\nthis with them, at length, at that time, including the\nrationale for this change.\n\nShe is not having any exertional or other chest pain.  No\northopnea, PND or peripheral edema.\n\nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Blood pressure is 135/80.  Heart rate\n68 and regular.  Respirations 14.  Venous pressure 3.  Clear\nchest.  S4, no S3.  No retrosternal dullness or rub.  She\nhas only a trace of ankle edema.\n\nIMPRESSION AND PLAN:  Her verbal skills have improved.  She\ngot very nervous when I tried to test her cognitive skills,\nand was able to give me the days of the week forward, but\nnot backwards.  I did not push her beyond that.  I did tell\nher that we would need to check her TSH in a couple weeks'\ntime, to see if last increment had returned her to a\neuthyroid state.\n\n\n______________________________\nSean Ugalde, M.D.\n\n\neScription document:7-829452 STeScription\n\nDD: 06/27/71\nDT: 06/27/71\nDV: 06/26/71\nRecord date: 2073-10-16\n\nEDVISIT^25816492^Uher, Olga^10/16/73^BALL, MILDRED\n\nThe patient was seen in conjunction with resident Dr. Sharp. \n\nThe resident's note reviewed.  The patient was seen and examined\n\nby me.\n\nHISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Briefly, this is a 62-year-old woman\n\nwho has had decrease in mental status and activity since 3 days\n\nago.  She has had some fevers off and on.  Temperature ranging\n\nbetween 100 and 101.3.  Her blood sugar has been 300-500.  She\n\nreports a decrease in energy.  She has end-stage renal disease on\n\nhemodialysis Sunday, Tuesday, and Thursday.  She had her dialysis\n\ntoday but has much less energy than usual.  She has a cough, no\n\nnausea, vomiting, or diarrhea, has constipation, takes lactulose,\n\nand has a normal bowel movement.  Last BM was Thursday evening. \n\nThis is a normal spacing of her usual bowel movements.  According\n\nto her visiting nurse, the urine looks dark.  Blood pressure is\n\nrunning in the low 100 in the last month.  Change in mental\n\nstatus for 5 days means that she is not as talkative as usually\n\nis.\n\nPAST MEDICAL HISTORY, SOCIAL HISTORY, AND REVIEW OF SYSTEMS: \n\nReviewed, confirmed, and notable for history of high cholesterol,\n\narthritis, insulin-dependent diabetes, retinopathy, renal\n\nfailure, foot ulcers, and hypothyroidism.\n\nSOCIAL HISTORY:  She was in an acute care facility as a nurse\n\ncoming regularly.  The patient arrives to the hospital with a\n\nDNR/DNH order, which near the end of her visit once the family\n\narrived, we got the information that this order has been and\n\nrescinded by the family in the past.  This is noted nowhere in\n\nher chart.\n\nREVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  Negative except as noted above.\n\nMEDICATIONS:  The patient takes methylphenidate, Ambien,\n\nPrilosec, Ultram, verapamil, PhosLo, Coumadin, Renax, Colace, and\n\nolanzapine.\n\nALLERGIES:  She is allergic to NSAIDs.\n\nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  She has a fever of 100.3, pulse of 95,\n\nrespirations 24, blood pressure 85/53, and saturating 90% on room\n\nair and 100% on 3 liters.

Mr. Xuereb is a 55-year-old white male who presents with an ischemic right foot.  He has a longstanding history of lower extremity occlusive disease and has worked as a high school principle.  He has undergone previous right SFA angioplasty in 2059, previous left SFA angioplasty and stent placement in 2062, previous right fem-pop above-knee bypass grafting in February 2070, previous left leg fem-pop bypass grafting with saphenous vein in April 2070 and a redo right fem below-knee popliteal bypass graft with a bifid saphenous vein performed in September 2070.  After this last procedure, the patient at the time of follow-up office visit was noted to have a nonfunctioning graft with an ischemic right lower extremity.  He denies any history of trauma.  He is a former smoker.  He denies any history of hypercoagulable states or history of significant coronary disease.  He does have longstanding non-insulin dependent diabetes mellitus as well as hypertension and COPD.\n\n\n\nPast surgical history is as above.\n\n\n\nMedications include Glucophage, Lopid, Prilosec, Norvasc, hydrochlorothiazide, Lipitor, Effexor, Plavix 75 mg q.d., aspirin, albuterol, Serevent, Nasacort and Pulmicort.\n\n\n\nNo known drug allergies.\n\n\n\nReview of systems is positive for diabetes, asthma and hypertension.  All other review of systems is negative as per H&P sheet.\n\n\n\nHabits, he is a former tobacco smoker.  He denies alcohol use.\n\n\n\nFamily history is positive for MI, stroke and cancer.\n\n\n\nOn physical exam, the patient is a well-developed and well-nourished male in moderate discomfort.  Respiratory rate is 12-14.  Pulse is 60-70 and regular.  Weight is 172 pounds.  Blood pressure is 170/90 in the right arm, 150/90 in the left.  No jugular venous distention.  Normal respiratory effort.  Lungs are clear to auscultation.  Heart, regular rate and rhythm.  No murmur or bruit.  He has no palpable abdominal aortic aneurysm.  He has normal carotid, brachial, radial and femoral pulses bilaterally.  Absent pedal pulses on the right with Doppler signals, which are monophasic.  On the left side, he has adequately perfused foot with normal capillary refill and Doppler signals.  He has moderate edema in the right lower extremity.  No varicosities.  He does have dependent rubor, cyanosis of the right forefoot and purplish discoloration of the tips of the right second to fifth toes.  The right great toe is blanched.  He has no abdominal masses, tenderness or hepatosplenomegaly.  He has grossly intact musculoskeletal tone and strength with no dermatitis, ulcers or sores.  He is alert and oriented to person, place and time with slightly depressed affect.\n\n\n\nAssessment and Plan:  \n\n\n\n1. Ischemic right lower extremity consistent with thrombosed bypass graft.  We will plan to admit the patient for treatment with intravenous heparin and plan to schedule him for an urgent arteriogram within the next 24 hours.  We will attempt to identify any possible way to re-establish flow  with either thrombolysis and/or angioplasty and stenting.  If this is unsuccessful, he will ultimately require redo fem-pop bypass graft.\n\n2. Tobacco abuse:  The patient needs to continue to remain abstinent from smoking.\n\n3. Hypertension:  Moderately controlled on current medications.  His previous angiogram did not reveal any evidence of any hemodynamically significant renal artery stenosis.  We will adjust him as appropriate from a medical standpoint.  \n\n4. Non-insulin dependent diabetes mellitus.  The patient's blood sugars are currently under good control on Glucophage, which we will need to hold post arteriogram.  I will keep you informed as to the status of this very nice patient.  \n\n\n\nThank you for allowing me to participate in his management.  If I can be of any further assistance and management of this or any of your patients with cerebrovascular, aortic, renovascular or low peripheral vascular disease, particularly those in need of a minimally invasive vascular procedure, please feel free to contact me directly.  \n\n\n\nSincerely,\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShane R.

As you remember, he recently underwent a revision of his lower extremity bypass graft with thrombectomy of the fem-pop bypass graft and subsequent jump graft to the below-knee popliteal artery.  He returns today for follow up evaluation. \n\n\n\nHe has a warm, well-perfused foot with a palpable dorsalis pedis pulse.  Unfortunately, over the last ten days he has developed increased erythema and tenderness on the medial aspect of his left knee with superficial skin breakdown consistent with either a staph or a strep cellulitis.  He had been on a course of p.o. antibiotics over a week ago for treatment of strep throat as well.  The patient has been increased his activity and prior to this time had been extremely active with no erythema, tenderness or drainage from his leg.  My concern is that he has increased warmth with blanching and erythema on the medial aspect of his knee consistent with a superficial cellulitis and I believe that he would benefit from hospital admission with a course of IV antibiotics, bedrest and elevate.  We will tentatively plan to admit him for localized wound care measures, treatment with IV Nafcillin on a q.4 hour basis.  In addition, he has intact femoral pulses on the left side.  He does report when he was ambulating he was having increased difficulty with claudication in the distal left lower extremity and calf region.  Most recent vascular lab studies dated November 29, 2070 reveal an ABI of 0.96 on the right, 0.56 on the left.  \n\n\n\nI will keep you informed as to the status of Mr. Xuereb.  My concern is that if he does infect this PTFE graft we do not have any suitable autogenous conduit to perform an additional reconstruction and he would stand a very high chance of losing his limb at the knee level.  If I can be of any further assistance in the management of this or any of your other patients with vascular disease, particularly those in need of a minimally invasive vascular procedure, please feel free to contact me directly.\n\n\n\n\n\nSincerely,\n\n\n\n\n\nShane R.

The wound bed was covered with yellow biofilm, which was debrided.  The underlying wound bed contained moist red tissue with a few drops of bloody drainage.  The margin was clear.  \n\n \n\nIMPRESSION:  There has been epithelialization of the wound along the medial aspect of the right knee.  There has been no further disruption of the epithelium overlying the hypertrophic scar tissue.   \n\n\n\nPLAN:  We will continue with dressing changes every two to three days per the following protocol: spray the wound with AllClenz wound cleanser followed by irrigation with normal saline 30 cc x 3; apply skin protectant to the periwound margin, Panafil paste 1/8\" thick to the wound bed, gauze dampened with normal saline (cut-to-fit), covered with DuoDerm secured with Medipore tape.  \n\n \n\nMr. Xuereb will return to clinic in two weeks.  \n\n \n\n__________________________ \n\nLillian Steele, N.P., Ph.D.  \n\n \n\nDD:04/27/2071 \n\nDT:04/28/2071 \n\nFJ:801734    :77\nRecord date: 2073-12-03\n\n \n\n\n\nCCU JAR ADMIT NOTE\n\n\n\nName:   Xuereb, Jaquante D\n\nMRN:   1344351\n\nDate of Admission:   12/03/73\n\nAdmitting Physician:   Dr. Burke\n\nCode Status: Full\n\nSource of Hx:   Chart, patient\n\n\n\nID/CC:   Chest pressure, pulmonary edema. \n\n\n\nHPI:   58 year old man with PMH HTN , Hypercholesterolemia, smoking.

Resp decompensation likely secondary to pulmonary edema in the setting of volume load. There is some question as to what to do about EKG changes and mild troponin elevations. No definite ST elevations, but elevation in troponin does seem to be too soon to be directly attributable to flash pulmonary edema and resultant demand. Follow enzymes,  heparinize both for ?ischemia and for PVD with sheath in place. As not lilely ACS, not emergent indication for cath, but he was scheduled for elective cath 12/08 and likely would benefit from expedited diagnosis. \n\n\n\nPump - intubated, diruesis as allowed by pressure (JVP up, some edema of CXR). Started on peripheral dopa, but this is at least partially related to sedation. \n\n\n\nRhythm - Bradycardia, no acute issues\n\n\n\nIscenmia - Demand ischemia vs NSTEMI. Follow markers. Likely to cath today where it is propble he will have 3vd and require CT surg consult.  Have request FMC records. \n\n\n\nHeme - FFP + lasix prior to cath. Heparin, \n\n\n\nResp -  Wean vent post cath/OP\n\n\n\n\n\nProphy - Heparin/nexium/peridex while vented. \n\n\n\n\n\nCode: Full\n\n\n\n______________\n\nS.

She denies any morning \nstiffness, any jelling phenomena.  She has had no trauma or effusions in \nthe knee.  She had noted on x-ray many years ago that she had had a \nchipped bone in the right knee and some mild osteoarthritis but it has \nbothered her only intermittently until this year.  Last year she did go \nto Briggs Stratton and dropped to 270 lb. at which point her knees felt \nbetter, but currently she is back up to over 300 lb. and at her height \nof 5 ft. 1 in., she is in pain.  She has not visited a physician.  She \nhas no internist who currently checks on her general medical health, but \nshe does report that the occasional Advil she takes does produce some \ndyspepsia.  She has no history of gout, no history of psoriasis, no \nhistory of pseudogout or any rash, alopecia, headaches, shoulder or hip \ndiscomfort.  She does not complain of back pain but does have difficult \nwalking 50 yards because of the knee pain.\n \nAllergies:  None.\n \nMedications:  Occasional Advil.\n \nPast Surgical History:  Cholecystectomy 2064.  Two c-sections.\n \nPast Medical History:  Negative for hypertension, diabetes, cancer, \nstroke, tuberculosis, hepatitis, asthma, heart disease.\n \nFamily History:  Mother is alive and well with no medical problems.  \nFather is alive and well with no medical problems.  She has 12 siblings.  \nOne sibling died of pneumonia at a young age.  Another sibling has \nasthma.\n \nPhysical Examination;  She is a markedly obese female, no apparent \ndistress.  She is 5 ft. 1 in. and weighs 304 lb.  Examination of joints:  \nNo evidence of active synovitis or pain in her DIPs, PIPs, MCPs, wrists, \nelbows, shoulders.  Bilateral hips are limited in internal external \nrotation but not because of pain-- due to obesity, bilateral knees have \ncrepitus, but no warmth or swelling.  There is some pain at extremes of \nflexion on the left of 110 degrees.  Ankles and toes within normal \nlimits.  Please note above in the clinical history that she does not \ncomplain of back pain but does have difficult walking 50 yards because \nof the knee pain.  The blood pressure could not be taken secondary to \nthe fact that the large blood pressure \ncuff did not fit around her right arm. \n \nImpression:  \n \n1.   Probable bilateral osteoarthritis.

She has had multiple admissions in the past for CHF and for ischemia.  Recent echo shows septal and apical hypokinesis.  \n\n\n\nShe has had no chest pain.  She does not complain of SOB.  She does cough, but this is because of the air conditioning and postnasal drip, she believes.  \n\n\n\nShe also complains of severe knee pain, with the right worse than the left.  She can walk a little, but standing is very painful.  \n\n\n\nIn addition, she complains of some food intolerance.  She has a hard time eating breakfast because she gets abdominal cramps.  After eating orange juice, she gets terrible cramping and has to run to the bathroom to have a bowel movement.  She has changed her milk to lactaid, which she says helps.  Certain types of salad dressing also cause this reaction.  \n\n\n\nProblems\t  \n\nMORBID OBESITY\t      \n\nKNEE OA\t      \n\nANSERINE BURSITIS, BILAT\t      \n\nS/P 2 C-SECTIONS\t      \n\nHTN\t      \n\nCAD\t      \n\nCHF\t      \n\nASTHMA\t      \n\n\n\nMedications\t  \n\nVENTOLIN\t 2PUFFS INH QID\n\nAZMACORT\t 4PUFFS INH BID\n\nECASA\t 1  PO QD\n\nATROVENT\t 2PUFFS INH QID\n\nTNG 0.4 MG\t    SL \n\nSEREVENT\t 2PUFFS INH BID\n\nFLOVENT\t 220MCG INH BID\n\nCOZAAR\t 100MG PO QD\n\nLOPRESSOR\t 25MG PO TID\n\nLASIX\t 60MG PO BID\n\nZANTAC\t 150MG PO BID\n\nNORVASC\t 10MG PO QD\n\nISOSORBIDE DINITRATE\t 20MG 1 Tablet(s) PO TID\n\n\n\nAllergies\t  \n\nLISINOPRIL\t COUGH\n\n\n\nSocial History\t\n\nEmployment:  Works in commercial diving.  \n\nMarital/Relationship:  She is married.

She is \n\nreferred for either fibromyalgia or polymyalgia.  The patient states she is \n\ncurrently 60 but was in her usual state of good health until 2065 when she \n\ndeveloped diffuse chest wall pain and tingling.  This continued to bother her \n\nand she eventually was treated with steroids.  I am not sure she had a \n\ndiagnosis of PMR or fibromyalgia.  She then was switched to ibuprofen which \n\ndid not work particularly well.  Over this time, she would have intermittent \n\nepisodes with nocturnal discomfort and most recently has increasing pain in \n\nher palms, back, neck, low back, legs, and into her arms.  She was seen by \n\nDr. Zink at Barr Clinic, and no blood studies were obtained, but she states \n\nshe had \"25 shots\" of steroids.  She denies any hot or swollen joints.  She \n\nhas had occasional arm swelling but this has resolved.  Extensive ROS reveals \n\nno photosensitivity but she does have some oral ulcers and Raynaud's.  She \n\nhas urgency regarding her bladder and has been evaluated but not particularly \n\nwell.  She has continued to be concerned about that.  She has had fevers or \n\nchills but no temperature elevation.  She has intermittent abdominal pain but \n\nhas had a colonoscopy two years ago and was evaluated for this.  She has \n\nmorning stiffness of about an hour and nocturnal pain through the night.\n\n\n\nFamily history is otherwise remarkable for diabetes in her father.  Mother is \n\n85.

I was seeing her for various rheumatologic issues.  She\n\ncomes in today with ongoing pain in the left side of her face. \n\nActually, upon exam, she clearly simply has left TMJ.  She has\n\nbeen told this by ENT and I reinforced to her that that is what\n\nshe has and she will go ahead with a dental visit that she had\n\nplanned.  However, she has other medical problems which I will\n\ndeal with until she sees you.  At her last visit, there was a\n\nquestion of PMR and she had \"25 shots\" of steroids but I have not\n\ngiven her steroids and she has done reasonably well.  However,\n\nshe does have a history of a recent mild anemia but has diabetes,\n\nhypertension and hypercholesterolemia and medications include\n\nmetformin, verapamil 250 b.i.d., Avapro 150 q.d., Pravachol 20\n\nq.d., Bumex, Bentyl, Prilosec and Allegra.\n\n\n\nPhysical examination today reveals left TMJ pain which reproduces\n\nher pain.  She had had no lymphadenopathy or thyromegaly.  HEENT\n\nwas otherwise unremarkable.  I obtained blood studies which\n\nrevealed a blood sugar of 208, abnormal LFTs with an AST of 62\n\nand ALT of 58, normal ferritin B12 and folic acid, TSH of 8.8\n\nwith thyroid antibodies pending, urine microalbumin/creatinine of\n\n14.5 and a CBC which had anemia with a hematocrit of 32.9.  A1c\n\npending.  A protein electrophoresis is pending and urinalysis did\n\nnot reveal proteinuria or sediment.  HBsAG and HCV are pending as\n\nwell.\n\n\n\nI will be in touch with her regarding these results.  I was\n\nwondering if you could see her sooner than September because of\n\nthese abnormalities outlined.

The following issues addressed:\n\n1.  Diabetes:  She is currently feeling well and denies any\n\nsymptoms of polyuria and polydipsia.  Maintained on Glucophage\n\n1000 mg b.i.d.  Blood sugar testing at home once or twice a day\n\nis around 120.  We will be obtaining glycohemoglobin level today.\n\n Has ophthalmological exam scheduled.\n\n2.  Elevated cholesterol:  With her diabetes, her target LDL will\n\nbe less than a 100.  She is maintained on Pravachol 40 mg a day\n\nand LDL from 09/15/83 was 154 with a total cholesterol of 256. \n\nWe will initiate Zetia to add to the Pravachol.\n\n3.  Hypothyroidism:  Maintained on Levoxyl and TSH level is\n\nacceptable at 3.93 with a T4 of 8.5.\n\n4.  Hypertension:  Maintained on Avapro and verapamil and blood\n\npressure is currently acceptable.\n\n5.  Question of rheumatological disease, elevated sedimentation\n\nrate, diagnosis of polymyalgia rheumatica has been considered in\n\nthe past.  No new symptoms of muscle aches, but now report a\n\nhistory of recent chest pain.\n\n6.  Exercise-induced chest pain.  The patient has noted over the\n\npast month that she gets a pressure sensation in her mid chest\n\nwhen she is walking after about 20 minutes of exertion.  This\n\nsubsides when she stops and rests for a while.  This has been\n\nreproduced for the last three times she has taken a walk with her\n\nhusband.  Review of records from Dr. Olive show that she had\n\nthallium stress test 12/26/79 achieving 85% of maximum predicted\n\nheart rate with a workload of 10.1 minutes.  EKG showed 1 mm ST\n\ndepression in leads II and V4 through 6.  The thallium scan\n\nshowed slight apical ischemia and mild ischemia in the anterior\n\nwalls suggesting minimal ischemia in the left anterior descending\n\nartery distribution.  She does not recall having symptoms at that\n\ntime.  Denies palpitations, sweats or shortness of breath with\n\nchest discomfort.  There are some radiation into both shoulders\n\nand neck.  Multiple cardiac risk factors include elevated lipids,\n\ndiabetes, hypertension and postmenopausal.\n\n\n\nCURRENT MEDICATIONS:  Levoxyl 50 mcg q.d., Pravachol 40 mg h.s.,\n\nPrilosec 20 mg q.d., Flexeril 10 mg q.d., Bumex 2 mg q.d., Avapro\n\n150 mg q.d., Verapamil of 240 mg b.i.d. and Glucophage 500 mg two\n\ntabs b.i.d.\n\n\n\nDRUG ALLERGIES:  None.\n\n\n\nSOCIAL HISTORY:  director/midwife for Iowa Clinic in Temescal Valley.\n\n\n\nREVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  Denies abdominal pain, change in bowel\n\nhabits, fevers, sweats chills, weight loss; otherwise, as above.\n\n\n\nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  She appears in no distress.  Temperature\n\nof 97.8 degrees, BP 130/70 and pulse is 70.  Pupils are equal,\n\nround and reactive.  Conjunctivae clear. Sclerae anicteric. \n\nOropharynx benign.  Neck is supple.  No neck vein distention. \n\nThyroid is not palpable.  Chest is clear to percussion and\n\nauscultation.  Heart:  Regular rhythm, S1, S2 and no murmur, rub,\n\nthrill or gallop.  Abdomen:  Soft, nontender, active bowel sounds\n\nand no organomegaly.  Extremities:  No clubbing, cyanosis or\n\nedema.  Neurophysiologic:  EKG shows normal sinus rhythm.  No\n\nabnormal complex.\n\n\n\nIMPRESSION AND PLAN:\n\n1.  Diabetes.  We will check her glycohemoglobin and assure she\n\nhas had an ophthalmologic follow up.  Maintain Glucophage.\n\n2.  Elevated cholesterol.  Add Zetia 10 mg q.d.\n\n3.  Chest pain.  Symptoms certainly suggest ischemia.  I have\n\ncontacted Dr. Ng in Cardiology and he is arranging for an\n\nETT MIBI and a cardiology consult.  I prescribed nitroglycerin\n\n1/150 to use sublingual q.5minutes. x 3 for chest\n\ndiscomfort and she will limit exercise until ETT is accomplished.\n\n Suspect she might need catheterization and hesitant to add\n\nbeta-blocker because of high-dose verapamil and risk of inducing\n\nheart block.\n\n4.  Hypothyroidism:  Adequate replacement dose on current\n\nLevoxyl.  The patient will see me back in four weeks' time and\n\ncardiac workup to be arranged for early next week.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n______________________________\n\nE Xochil Higgins, M.D.\n\n\n\n\n\nDictated By: E Xochil Higgins\n\n\n\n\n\neScription document:8-7850722 EMSSten Tel\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDD: 10/02/83\n\nDT: 10/02/83\n\nDV: 10/02/83\nRecord date: 2083-11-01\n\n\n\nWestwing Place Nursing Home\n\n144 Chablis Court                                    GERALD, MARION\n\nDoha, KY 63216                            48967301\n\n(638) 074-1457                                           11/01/83\n\n(449) 515-0294\n\n\n\nREASON FOR VISIT:  Follow up coronary disease and diabetes.\n\n\n\nHISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:\n\n1.  The patient underwent an angioplasty on 10/07/83 and comes in\n\ntoday having just had a stress test.  Stress test showed that she\n\nwas able to do a standard Bruce protocol for 7 minutes 34 seconds\n\nachieving maximal heart rate of 116, peak blood pressure 122/60,\n\nstopped for fatigue.  Immediately after exercise, she did have\n\nsome substernal chest pain, resolved 3 minutes into recovery. \n\nThere were no EKG changes.  The patient reports that she has been\n\nwalking and has resumed her normal pre-hospitalization exercise\n\nlevel and does not have any chest discomfort with walk, which had\n\nprecipitated the hospitalization initially.  She is looking into\n\ncardiac rehab program but is not sure that she needs to do this. \n\nShe feels very comfortable with her current exercise regimen. \n\nShe has been careful with her eating and feels she is living a\n\nhealthy lifestyle.  She has returned to work.  She has follow up\n\nscheduled with Dr. Schaefer in two days' time.\n\n2.  Diabetes:  At last visit, I had added glyburide 5 mg to her\n\nGlucophage 2000 mg a day.  She monitors blood sugars but only in\n\nthe morning.  Evening blood sugars are mostly in 90s to low 100s.\n\n However, at times during the day, she feels hypoglycemically\n\nsweating and abdominal discomfort.  She has never actually\n\nchecked her blood sugar during these episodes as they tend to\n\noccur at work.  She has not had any fainting or dizziness.\n\n3.  Elevated cholesterol, is tolerating Zetia.\n\n4.  Hypertension.  At last visit, we decreased her Avapro dose\n\nbecause her blood pressure was quite low at 100/64, and\n\ncurrently, she feels somewhat less fatigued.\n\n\n\nCURRENT MEDICATIONS:  Glyburide 5 mg q.d., Plavix 75 mg q.d.,\n\natenolol 50 mg q.d., Zetia 10 mg q.d., levoxyl 50 mcg q.d.,\n\nPrilosec 20 mg q.d., Flexeril 10 mg q.d., Bumex 2 mg q.d.,\n\nPravachol 20 mg two tablets q.h.s., Avapro 75 mg q.d., Glucophage\n\n500 mg two tablets b.i.d., and enteric-coated aspirin.\n\n\n\nDRUG ALLERGIES:  None.\n\n\n\nREVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  She denies chest pain, palpitation, shortness\n\nof breath, abdominal pain, or joint pain.\n\n\n\nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  She appears in excellent health and in\n\ngood spirits.  Weight is 145, blood pressure 120/68, and pulse is\n\n70 and regular.  Conjunctivae are clear.  Sclerae are anicteric. \n\nNeck is supple.  No neck vein distention.  Chest is clear to\n\npercussion and auscultation.  Heart: Regular rhythm.  S1 and S2. \n\nNo murmur, rub, thrill, or gallop.  Extremities are without\n\nclubbing, cyanosis, or edema.\n\n\n\nIMPRESSION AND PLAN:\n\n1.  Coronary disease, doing well, status post recent angioplasty\n\nwith stenting.  Maintaining current medications of Dr. Schaefer. \n\nAt this point, I am not sure that she actually does need cardiac\n\nrehab, and we will defer that decision to him.\n\n2.  Diabetes, seems as though her control is \n\nimpressive, perhaps with recent change in her diet.  We will\n\ndiscontinue the glyburide and follow up in 4 weeks.\n\n3.  Elevated cholesterol.  We will check on lipid status in four\n\nweeks' time.  On current medications with target of LDL less than\n\n100.\n\n4.  Hypertension.  Blood pressure acceptable on current medical\n\nregimen.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n______________________________\n\nE Xochil Higgins, M.D.\n\n\n\n\n\nDictated By: E Xochil Higgins\n\n\n\n\n\neScription document:4-4587137 EMSSten Tel\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDD: 11/01/83\n\nDT: 11/01/83\n\nDV: 11/01/83\nRecord date: 2084-01-10\n\n\n\nChief Complaint\n\nf/u DM, CAD\n\n\n\nHistory of Present Illness\n\nMarion reports feeling quite well.

She showed me a foot ulcer\n\nthat she has had since early August. In fact, this was debrided on August 9 by Dr.\n\nNoyes and was found to contain Staph aureus sensitive to oxacillin and Bactrim.\n\nShe was treated with Augmentin for 2 weeks with little improvement. She has not\n\nhad any fever. She continues on her chronic pain medications and Percocet. \n\n\n\nOn exam, the second toe on the right foot is severely swollen and red. There is an\n\nulcer which looks quite deep on the medial aspect of the toe. I had Dr. Drew\n\ntake a look at her foot who agreed that she should be seen in the emergency room. \n\n\n\nIMPRESSION:  Cellulitis/right toe ulcer - Persistent infection and unresponsiveness\n\nto 2-week course of Augmentin raise concern of underlying osteomyelitis. Rebecca\n\nwas referred into the emergency room for further evaluation. She also was given a\n\nnew prescription for her Percocet #100. I will see her in follow-up in 1 month. \n\n\n\nRowena Xanders, M.D.\n\n\n\nRX/mcbride/richardson\n\n\n\ncc:  Georgia Xing, M.D.\nRecord date: 2092-12-27\n\n\n\n\n\nNAME:     Yager, Rebecca \n\nMRN:      0887181 \n\n\n\nFOLLOW-UP VISIT  \n\n\n\nPatient returns for follow-up of painful neuropathy.  \n\n\n\nSince last seen, her Dilantin level came back at 18.8.  She feels her pain has been\n\nunder relatively good control.  She has had a few falls since she was last seen all\n\ndue to losing her balance or tripping.  No lightheadedness or vertigo preceding her\n\nfalls.  She is trying to be more careful to avoid future falls by watching closely\n\nwhere she is walking.  \n\n\n\nShe has no active infection at present.  She is scheduled for follow-up EMG nerve\n\nconduction studies in January.  \n\n\n\nON EXAM:  She is her usual pleasant self.  Examination of the feet shows\n\nhammertoes, numerous bunions, some reddened calluses but no ulcers or open\n\nlesions.  There is vibratory loss to the ankles and absent ankle jerks bilaterally.  \n\n\n\nIMPRESSION:  Painful neuropathy with 10-year history of progressive symptoms. \n\nNumerous previous work-ups for reversible causes of neuropathy have been\n\nnegative.  I would like to have her be evaluated by Dr. Phyllis Brewer of\n\nInternal Medicine to see if she has any other ideas as to any additional work-up\n\nor treatment.  Of note, previously had a DENA panel for sensory neuropathy\n\nwhich was negative.  Rebecca was given a new prescription for Percocet #100.  I will\n\nsee her in follow-up in two months. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRowena Xanders, M.

She was terminated at her job working as a Credit Manager in December 2093.  She\ntherefore has been having financial problems.  She does not have enough money to\nbuy her medications.  She has a history of hypertension and hypercholesterolemia. \nShe has not taken these medications for months.  She states she has been taking her\nnortriptyline, dilantin and Percocet as previously prescribed.  When I called her from\nthe waiting room today, she walked towards me, she veered, and I caught her before\nshe fell.  We then got the wheelchair and wheeled her into the room and history was\ntaken.  She reports being off balance for about the past month.  She has been feeling\nmore unsteady on her feet.  She states she has not actually fallen but has come close\nto falling.  She denies any true vertigo, ringing in her ears, headaches, change in\nmentation, numbness, weakness or change in gait.  On review of other systems, she\nreports a 20 lb. weight gain over the past few months which she attributes to not\nworking and being at home and eating more than usual.  She also notes that she has\nbegun urinating at night which she previously did not do.  She complains of excessive\ndry mouth.  She reports being more thirsty than usual.  \n\nPHYSICAL EXAM:  On exam, she was her usual pleasant self.  She is alert and\noriented X 3.  Speech fluent without aphasia.  BP sitting 145/70.  Pulse 80.  Standing\nBP unchanged at 145/70.  Pulse 80.  Cranial nerve exam notable for prominent\nbilateral nystagmus.  Otherwise intact.  On motor exam, no tremor or involuntary\nmovements.  No drift.  Good power throughout.  Fine finger movements intact. \nVibratory loss to the ankles.  Babinski flexor bilaterally.  \n\nWhen she got up to stand at the end of the evaluation to leave and telling me she\nwas fine, she veered to the right and I again caught her.  \n\nIMPRESSION:  Imbalance with history of recently running out of many of her\nmedications though taking her chronic pain medications as previously prescribed. \nAlso notable in the history is new nocturia, increased thirst and dry mouth.  Her\nexam is notable for prominent end-gaze nystagmus.  Therefore I suspect toxic\nmetabolic cause.  As she will need STAT lytes, blood sugar, dilantin level and tox\nscreen as well as cardiac evaluation, the patient was referred to PROMPTCARE ER.  I will be\nin touch with the physicians after they see her.\n\nRowena Xanders, M.D.\n\nRX/mcbride/tucker\n\ncc:  Georgia Xing, M.D.\nRecord date: 2096-04-11\n\n \n\nInternal Medicine Intern Admission Note\n\n\n\nPatient Name:  REBECCA YAGER\n\nMR#:  0887181\n\nDate of Admission:  4/11/96\n\nAttending:  Dr. Georgia Xing\n\nIntern:  Branden Ocasio\n\n\n\nID/CC:    There's a herd of elephants on my chest.    \n\n\n\nHPI: \t69 yo F with PMH of DM, HTN, s/p MI one year ago, now presents with substernal chest pain and increased shortness of breath x 2 days.  Patient was in her usual state of health until 3 days prior to admission, when she began experiencing unremitting substernal chest pain, nonradiating.  This pain was constant,    24 hours/day   , and    felt like a herd of elephants on my chest.     This was accompanied by an increased shortness of breath, especially with exertion, which the patient had not experienced before.  The chest pain and shortness of breath would wake her up at night, accompanied by drenching sweats and a dizziness,    I felt like I was about to faint.     Patient sleeps with two pillows at baseline.  The pain eventually grew to be so severe that the patient called EMS.  Upon their arrival at her house she was given 2 doses of SL nitro which improved her pain.  \n\n\n\nIn the TPG ED her vital signs were Temp AF, HR 70, BP 154/79, RR 20, satting 99% RA.  EKG showed a new Twave inversion in V3, otherwise at her baseline normal EKG.  IV heparin was started for possible MI given her symptoms and history.  D-dimer was elevated at 782. Based on these findings and her shortness of breath, PE-CT was obtained, which was negative for PE.  However, it did show multiple new mediastinal lymph nodes up to 9mm in size, as well as a 6mm nodule in the LLL.  The patient was given ASA, MSO4, nitro, and made chest pain free in the ED.  She was admitted for continued rule out for MI and workup of her pulmonary findings.  \n\n\n\nROS:  No fevers/chills. Does report cough, cold sores x 1 week.

There are several mediastinal lymph\n\n\tnodes measuring slightly less than 1 cm in size.  However, in the\n\n\tregion of the AP window there are numerous AP window lymph nodes\n\n\tmeasuring approximately 9 mm in short axis.  These could be\n\n\treactive or neoplastic.  There is a less than 1 cm left hilar\n\n\tnode.  In the posterior left lower lobe there is a 6 mm\n\n\tparenchymal nodule. This is best demonstrated on image 65. This\n\n\tcould possibly represent a malignancy.  Alternatively this could\n\n\trepresent an intraparenchymal lymph node.  This does not appear to\n\n\ttouch the pleural surface and rounded atelectasis would seem less\n\n\tlikely.  Some scarring and volume loss is noted in the medial\n\n\tright lung base.  There is no pneumothorax.  No significant\n\n\tpleural fluid is noted.  There is no pericardial fluid.\n\nIMPRESSION:\n\n\tNo pulmonary embolism or DVT.  There are multiple mediastinal\n\n\tlymph nodes as well as a 6 mm nodule in the left lower lobe.\n\n\tNeoplasm cannot be excluded.  A follow-up chest CT may be further\n\n\tvalue.  These findings were discussed with Dr. Hendricks at the time\n\n\tof dictation.\n\n\n\nEKG:  NSR, compared to prior there is new flipped T wave in III, however no ST/T wave abnormalities, no evidence of infarction.\n\n\n\nA/P:\n\nPt is a 69 yo F with PMH notable for DM, HTN, peripheral neuropathy and s/p MI with multiple admissions for rule out, who presents with chest pain, shortness of breath, nightsweats, dizziness, and new mediastinal lymphadenopathy with a lung nodule not noted on prior chest X-rays.  This constellation of symptoms may be viewed in several different ways:  from a cardiac standpoint, as presentation of unstable angina, given her hx of MI and cardiac risk factors; from an oncological standpoint, as a pheochromocytoma or carcinoid syndrome, given the sympathomimetic nature of her symptoms such as dizziness, abd pain/nausea, chest pain and dyspnea, and the findings in Ab CT and Chest CT, or a primary lung cancer given her history of smoking; from an infectious disease standpoint, as possible reactivation tuberculosis, given that she has a history of TB infection and treatment.  I believe the priority of the differential should be granted to the oncologic and infectious etiologies, given that she appears to be ruling out for an MI, has little to no ischemic changes on EKG, and is chest pain free with continued exacerbation of her shortness of breath and sweating.  Workup should proceed in the direction of ruling out TB, and establishing the nature of the pulmonary nodule and mediastinal lymphadenopathy.\n\n\n\nCV:\n\n--Rate:  well controlled without medication. \n\n--Rhythm:  normal sinus\n\n--Pump:  On ACEI, HCTZ for HTN.  \n\n--ischemia:  on ASA/statin.  Rule out for MI with CMs x 3.  Will obtain stress test in AM.  \n\n  \n\nPULM:  \n\n--plant PPD\n\n--send sputum cultures, consider adding AFB.\n\n--send ANCA\n\n--follow up CT for nodule\n\n--nebs/O2 therapy to support breathing\n\n\n\nENDO:\n\n--urine metanephrines for pheo\n\n--5HIAA metabolites for carcinoid\n\n--TSH\n\n--AB-CT for evolution of adenoma\n\n--holding metformin, will control with SSIR.\n\n\n\nProphy\n\n--Nexium\n\n--holding on fragmin for now-low threshold to resume for DVT prophy given possible oncologic diagnosis."}

ZUBIA, M.D.\n\n\n\n\n\nOncology CONSULTATION NOTE:\n\n\n\nDATE OF CONSULTATION:\n\n\n\nDIAGNOSIS:  T2b, NX, M0 Gleason 4+3=7 adenocarcinoma of the prostate.\n\n\n\nHISTORY:  Mr. Meyar is a delightful patient referred to me by Dr. Osiel Mckee.  His PSA in 2093 was 3.8, early this year 6.3, and on repeat 7.1.  Abnormality was noted on digital rectal exam.  He has very little in the way of voiding symptoms with a good stream, no dribbling, nor any frequency.  He does still have his erections, though they are not as good as they used to be.  The erections are still an important issue with him.  Dr. Mckee performed a transrectal ultrasound that showed a 13 cc prostate.  He took 12 biopsy cores and all 12 demonstrated prostate cancer.  In 4 it was Gleason 6 and in the remainder Gleason 7.  Many cores had a predominant Gleason 4 pattern.  Many of the cores were heavily involved with 40% involvement or more.  Mr. Mercado has a CT scan and a pelvic MRI scheduled for next week.\n\n\n\nPAST MEDICAL HISTORY:\n\n1.\tDiabetes.\n\n2.\tNephrolithiasis status post lithotripsy.\n\n3.\tTonsillectomy.\n\n4.\tRight inguinal hernia repair.\n\n5.\tInflammatory bowel disease.\n\n\n\nCURRENT MEDICATIONS:  Glipizide, metformin, and Avandia.\n\n\n\nDRUG ALLERGIES:  None known.\n\n\n\nSOCIAL HISTORY:  His father was diagnosed with prostate cancer in his late 70s, but he did not die from his disease.\n\n\n\nSOCIAL HISTORY:  He works as a Web Developer in Audiovox.  He is married and came with his wife to the appointment today.  He has no children.  He is a former smoker and occasional drinker.\n\n\n\n\n\nPHYSICAL EXAM:\n\nNo anemia, jaundice, cyanosis, or clubbing\n\nNo gynecomastia\n\nRespiration comfortable\n\nNo neurologic abnormalities in the arms or legs\n\nNo skeletal deformity or tenderness\n\nHead, eyes, ears, and nose normal \n\nAbdomen soft with no hepatomegaly, splenomegaly, nor any additional masses.\n\nNo hernias.\n\nNormal penis, scrotum, and testes.\n\nRectum: no mural lesion. Stool guaiac negative\n\nProstate is small.  The entire right side of his gland is taken up with tumor.\n\n\n\nIMPRESSION AND PLAN:  Mr. Meyer is a young man with a significant and quite bulky prostate cancer.  I certainly do not think active surveillance is an option for him, which is a shame, as that was his preference.  Left untreated, I think he will be in deep trouble at some stage over the next few years.  His second choice for treatment is prostate brachytherapy but again I believe his disease is too extensive for this and brachytherapy would represent significant under treatment.\n\n\n\nOn balance, my preference for him is either to have a radical prostatectomy, perhaps followed by postoperative radiation or alternatively, if he wishes to avoid surgery and he does, for him to have high-dose external radiation in conjunction with neoadjuvant and concomitant androgen deprivation.  While I think he will recover good voiding function after either of these treatment combinations his sex life is under threat and he is aware of this.  We will defer the final decision next week until he has had his scans.  Obviously, should they show extensive extracapsular disease then surgery will be off the table, if they show nodal disease the same is true and we will be thinking in terms of long-term androgen deprivation.  Hopefully neither of these scenarios will occur.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVictor M. Zubia, M.D.\n\n\n\ncc:\n\nOsiel U.

ZUBIA, MD \n\nDATES OF RADIATION: 5/27/95 - 7/24/95 (58 elapsed days) \n\nDIAGNOSIS: Prostate adenocarcinoma T2B Nx,  Gleason 4+3 = 7,  PSA 7.1\n\nCONCISE HISTORY: Mr. Meyer is a 63 year old man who was found to have an elevated PSA of 7.1 on screening exam. An abnormality was also noted on DRE at that time.  Prostate biopsy was performed, and all 12 cores were positive for disease, including 8 cores with Gleason 7 disease.  Prostatic MRI showed no evidence of extracapsular extension.  CT of the abdomen and bone scan revealed no evidence of metastatic disease.  He was treated with definitive radiation to the prostate and seminal vesicles by IMRT, with concomitant Zoladex treatment.\n\nSPECIAL TECHNICAL CONSIDERATIONS: The patient underwent CT-based imaging to define the target volume and the normal tissue structures and 3D treatment planning was performed for treatment with IMRT. Daily localization of the prostate was done using the BAT ultrasound. \n\nSUMMARY OF RADIATION AND TREATMENT ADMINISTERED: The treatment site was the prostate gland plus the caudal seminal vesicles followed by a boost to the prostate alone. \n\nThe patient underwent external beam radiotherapy to the prostate and caudal seminal vesicles to a dose of 45 Gy given as 25 fractions of 1.8 Gy/day. He then underwent a boost to the prostate only of 34. Gy given in 17 fractions of 2 Gy/day for a total dose of 79 Gy. \n\nCLINICAL COURSE: The patient developed mild nocturia and more frequent bowel movements, for which he took Flomax and Metamucil. Mr. Meyer has tolerated his androgen deprivation therapy well.\n\nFOLLOW-UP: Mr. Meyer will follow up with us in 3 months with a PSA in advance.\n\nUlysses Imler, MD (Resident)\n\nVictor Zubia, MD (Attending) \n\ncc:\nRecord date: 2095-12-02\n\nSECTIONS OF THIS NOTE WERE CREATED WITH A 'COPY AND PASTE' ACTION.

Jordan Duran:\n\n64 y.o. male with known CAD. He has multiple risk factors and a cardiac history dating back to December 2095. At that time he was experiencing exertional chest pressure while shoveling. He initially attributed his symptoms to GERD; however the chest pressure began to occur post prandially and nocturnally. He was admitted at SCH where his ECG revealed non-specific ST T wave abnormalities and he had negative enzymes. \n\nHe was then transferred to WPH where cardiac catheterization revealed a 90% LAD lesion, a 70% OM1 lesion, a 70% 3rd OM and an 85% RCA. His ejection fraction at that time was 40%. He was referred for surgery. He underwent a successful CABG x 5 with a LIMA to the LAD, a sequential SVG to the Acute Marginal and PDA, and a sequential SVG to the 1rst Diagonal and OM1. \n\nHe now presents with recurrent chest burning. He states that it is similar in nature to his symptoms prior to CABG. His chest burning is exertional and is relieved with rest. He denies dyspnea, nausea, vomiting, dizziness and diaphoresis. During a follow up appointment at SCH, he was referred for a stress test. Per Bruce Protocol he exercised 6 minutes and 0 seconds. He states that his chest burning symptoms returned and were lessened with SL TNG, though not completely resolved. MIBI images reveal severe large perfusion defect extending from the septum to apex with reversibility. There is also a fixed basal infero-lateral territory consistent with infarct. His ejection fraction is 46%. He was admitted for cardiac catheterization done today with full report pending. Reportedly RCA diffuse, SVG-PDA patent, SVg-Dx1-OM patentw/ mod. ostial stenosis, LIMA-LAD 100%, LM mild, LAD severe w/ distal 100%, LCx OM 100%.

Briefly, this is a 54-year-old female with a \nknown mass in her vagina, who presents now with vaginal bleeding. \nThe patient was seen earlier yesterday by the Oncology service, \nand is scheduled to have surgery for the mass to be removed, but \nshe developed significant vaginal bleeding and presented to the \nEmergency Department today.  She is otherwise healthy.  Her first \ntime seen in the Emergency Department or seen by Oncology was two \nweeks ago for increased bleeding.  She was diagnosed at the time \nwith a necrotic fibroid, and was confirmed by studies to have a \nlarge fibroid at that time.  She now presents with increasing \nweakness and light-headedness and more bleeding. \nTHERAPY RENDERED/COURSE IN ED:  In the Emergency Department, an IV \nwas started, and laboratory studies sent, including CBC, \nelectrolytes, PT/PTT, and she was also typed and crossed and a \nurinalysis sent.  A chest x-ray and EKG were sent.  The patient was \nmade n.p.o.  She is a preoperative patient.  Her initial hematocrit \nhere was 23.  A full note was written by the Oncology service, \nand she is currently admitted to that service. \nFINAL DIAGNOSIS:  Vaginal bleeding with necrotic leiomyoma. \nDISPOSITION (including condition on discharge):  As above.

Over the past year she had had menorrhagia and \nunderwent endometrial biopsy in September of 2078 followed by total abdominal \nhysterectomy in early October of 2078.  Her post-operative course was \ncomplicated by a pelvic abscess for which she was rehospitalized in late \nOctober and during that hospitalization had an episode of atrial fibrillation \nwhich reverted spontaneously to sinus rhythm.  The episode was accompanied by \nsome substernal chest heaviness but no other symptoms and she was not aware of \nany palpitations.  She was placed on verapamil 240 mg daily and has not had \nany symptomatic recurrences.  Her abdominal incision is open but healing and \nshe has been recovering well.  She has no prior cardiac history.  She \nspecifically denies any exertional chest pain, palpitations, or transient \nneurologic symptoms.  She can climb a flight of stairs at her own pace but is \nmildly dyspneic at the top of the stairs.  She feels that her exertional \ncapacity has increased somewhat over the past year and a half since she \nstopped smoking.  She does not have a known history of hypertension, however \nVNA has been documenting blood pressures in the range of 130 to 190 mm Hg \nsystolic with diastolic pressures ranging from 72 to 110 mm Hg despite therapy \nwith verapamil.  There is no prior history of syncope.\n \nPage Two\nRE:IRENE YARBROUGH\nCDH#810 86 43 7\nNovember 10, 2078\n \n \n \nHer current medications are verapamil 240 mg daily as above and Premarin.  She \nhas GI intolerance to several analgesic medications.  She previously smoked \ntwo packs per day but quit a year and a half ago of her own volition without \nany particular change in her health precipitating this.  She rarely drinks \nethanol.  She has not had any prior surgeries.  \n \nFamily history is negative for premature coronary artery disease.  Review of \nsystems is negative for thyroid disease and a TSH was normal during her last \nadmission.\n \nPhysical examination reveals a healthy-appearing obese woman sitting \ncomfortably with a blood pressure of 140/90, heart rate 73 and regular.  HEENT \nis externally unremarkable.  There is no lid lag and no thyromegaly.  Carotids \nare palpable bilaterally. Lungs are clear to auscultation.  Cardiac exam \nreveals somewhat distant heart tones and I am not able to palpate the apical \nimpulse.  There is a soft systolic murmur at the left sternal border.  Abdomen \nis soft and nontender.  There is a healing surgical incision in the lower \nabdomen.  Extremities are without edema.  Dorsalis pedis pulses are easily \npalpable.\n \nThe 12-lead electrocardiogram shows sinus rhythm at 73 bpm with a PR interval \nof .18, QRS .08.  There are low amplitude T waves in the lateral precordium \nand inverted T waves in I and aVL with slightly leftward axis.  An \nechocardiogram performed during her last hospitalization was normal, although \nwith some mild evidence of ventricular hypertrophy.\n \nMy impression is that Ms. Yarbrough has had one episode of atrial fibrillation in \nthe perioperative period.  She probably has mild labile hypertension which has \nnot been previously treated.  This would explain her electrocardiographic \nchanges and the echocardiogram as well as the possible predisposition to \natrial fibrillation.  I took the liberty of switching her from verapamil 240 \nmg daily to atenolol 50 mg daily.  Once her incision is further healed we will \narrange for her to have an exercise tolerance test to get some reassurance \nregarding the possible co-existence of coronary artery disease in view of her \nmild electrocardiographic abnormalities in atrial fibrillation.  \n \nPage Three\nRE:IRENE YARBROUGH\nCDH#810 86 43 7\nNovember 10, 2078\n \n \n \nwill see her again in six weeks at which time she will have the exercise \ntolerance test.  We cautioned her to take her pulse on a daily basis and \nreport to us if it becomes irregular and rapid.  We also gave her a \nprescription for nitroglycerin 0.4 mg and instructions on how to take this \nmedication in the event of a recurrence of the substernal chest discomfort \nwhich accompanied her transient atrial fibrillation.\n \nThank you very much for allowing me to participate in her care.\n \nSincerely,\n \n \n \nPaul N.

The Chief Complaint, History \nof Present Illness, Past Medical History, Medications, Allergies, \nSocial History, Family History and Review of Systems are as noted \nby Dr. Nettles on the record and were reviewed with him and with \nthe patient.  Briefly, this is a 55 year old woman who presented \nwith chest pain which was epigastric and substernal in nature, \nessentially sharp and non-radiating that had come on at rest.  She \nhas several cardiac risk factors including hypertension, obesity \nand hormone replacement but had no specific cardiac history.  Her \nsymptoms did not resolve with Mylanta. \nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  As noted by Dr. Nettles and is most \nnoteworthy for normal heart sounds, although she does have a II/VI \nsystolic ejection murmur at the apex (the upper right sternal \nborder). \nLABORATORY EVALUATION:  An electrocardiogram does not show acute \nchanges but does have T wave inversions in V1 to V3.  These were \npreviously noted in 10/78. \nTHERAPY RENDERED/COURSE IN ED:  The patient required nitroglycerine \nand nitroglycerine, IV nitroglycerine and IV heparin with some \nmorphine to relieve her pain.  She also received Lopressor 25 mg IV \nand was given some GI meds.  She eventually became pain-free, \nalthough she does admit to a residual mild discomfort in her chest. \nThere are no electrocardiographic changes. \nIMPRESSION:  I concur with Dr. Nettles that this patient has chest \npain suspicious for unstable angina.  She has responded well to \naggressive treatment of this and she will be admitted for further \nevaluation. \nFINAL DIAGNOSIS:  Chest pain. \nDISPOSITION (including condition upon discharge):  Admission. \nCondition satisfactory. \n___________________________________                    MR190/0660 \nANTHONY G.

The patient states that he has had past carpal tunnel release and trigger finger release of the bilateral hand and the symptoms that he is feeling now is somewhat similar 2-10 years ago appearance of symptoms.\n\nPAST MEDICAL HISTORY:\n\nHypertension, diabetes mellitus, and chronic renal failure.\n\nPAST SURGICAL HISTORY:\n\nBilateral eye surgeries, right shoulder surgeries, and bilateral carpal tunnel surgery as mentioned above.\n\nCURRENT MEDICATIONS:\n\nMultiple antibiotics including isoniazid, doxycycline, insulin, Cardura, Glucophage, Elavil, and Biaxin.  Please note that the patient is hepatitis C positive and hepatitis B positive.\n\nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION:\n\nOn today s examination, the patient was noted to have a fairly long carpal tunnel scar on bilateral hands extending all the way to the volar wrist level.  Long finger and right index finger scar at the base at the MP joint level is noted, the fourth trigger release, which was performed in 2062 as well.  The patient has rather stiff fingers overall with inability to fully flex the fingers all the way to the thumb space.  There is no locking or triggering, but fairly extensive stiffness involving the flexor tendon was noted.  Durkan s test was positive and Phalen s test was positive as well.  However, abductor pollicis brevis function is intact.  Other examination demonstrated some noticeable decrease in size of the muscle with some prominence of the vasculature on the radial side of the left hand, but otherwise normal examination.\n\nIMPRESSION:\n\nAs above.\n\nPLAN:\n\nMy recommendation is that patient undergo very vigorous assessment for the median nerve function.  In addition to this, I would like to actually consider providing him with the stretching exercises and flexion exercises as well as passive range of motion of the fingers.  It may be a little to early to consider this option until he returns with the result of EMG nerve conduction study.\n\n\n\n\nVance-Ernest Yamasaki, M.D.\nOrthopaedics \n\n\nVEY/kiser\t\t59-56557099.doc\n\ncc:\tHarold Elliott, M.D.\nRecord date: 2073-04-27\n\nSDU Admission Note\n\nTuesday, Apr 27, 2073\n\n\n\nLujan, Victor\n\nSMH 0189233\n\n54yM\n\nSDU Admission: 04/27/73\n\n\n\nPCP: Elliott\n\nCards: Alston\n\n\n\nChief complaint\n\nChest pain\n\n\n\nHistory of present illness\n\n54 year old man with DM1 for >40 years, ESRD on HD, CAD, s/p PCI at VHOC and Sipher stent to LAD (100% lesion) on 4/10.

There is severe anterior and anteroseptal\n\n   hypokinesis, extending from base to apex.  No left ventricular thombus is\n\n   detected.  \n\n2. Normal right ventricular size and systolic function.\n\n3. Borderline left atrial enlargement.  Normal right atrial size.\n\n4. The aortic valve is trileaflet with normal leaflet excursion.  No\n\n   significant aortic stenosis or insufficiency is detected.  \n\n5. The aortic root appears normal in size.\n\n6. The mitral valve appears morphologically normal, without prolapse.  There is\n\n   trace mitral regurgitation.   \n\n7. Normal tricuspid valve, without detected regurgitation.  Right ventricular\n\n   systolic pressure could not be estimated due to insufficient tricuspid\n\n   regurgitation.\n\n8. There is no significant pulmonic insufficiency.\n\n9. No significant pericardial effusion.

Specifically he had: CABG x 3;  LIMA: Pedicle (IMA) to LAD-Mid Saphenous Vein: Ascending Aorta to Diagonal-2nd Saphenous Vein: Ascending Aorta to Diagonal-3rd; Coronary Endarterectomy.\n\n\n\nHe was in his USOH until several months ago when he first noticed lower extremity edema and activity intolerance. Symptoms waxed and waned, but eventually progressed so he was experiencing daily SOB and fatigue with usual daily activities such as walking or working around his home, and worsening LE edema up to his knees. He sought evaluation from his PCP 3 weeks ago was and found to have severe cardiomyopathy with LVEF of 25% on stress-MIBI. There was global hypokinesis. Perfusion images suggest a small distal anteroapical scar and moderately dilated LV (both new since 2076). There was no definite evidence of ischemia, although it is noted the patient was unable to achieve 85% MPHR due to poor activity tolerance. \n\n\n\nHe was started on Coreg, as well as Lasix which has been uptitrated from 20 to 60mg qd, with subsequent 12-14 lbs weight loss. His lower extremity edema is markedly improved, and activity tolerance is moderately improved. He can perform basic ADLs such as dressing and bathing without difficulty. Walking, especially inclines, climbing stairs, and carrying parcels will cause SOB. He still feels fatigued throughout the day. He has no orthopnea, PND, abdominal distension, early satiety, abdominal pain or anorexia. He reports BPs are much improved with the addition of Coreg, even as they are running 130-150s/80-100. \n\n\n\n\tPast medical history:\n\n   1. DCM, diagnosed 7/81. \n\n2. HTN, long standing, poorly controlled. \n\n3. DM, onset ~2074. became insulin dependent several months ago. \n\na. Retinopathy and cotton wool spot. \n\nb. No peripheral neuropathy. \n\n4.

Hyperlipidemia. On low dose statin. \n\n\n\n\tFamily history:\n\n   Father had HTN, stroke age 45. \n\nMother had HTN. \n\nNo known coronary artery disease, arrhythmias, SCD, heart failure, cardiomyopathy in immediate family members.\n\n\n\n\tSocial history:\n\n   He is married, with 3 young adult children who are A+W. He was formerly self-employed as a CPA and would often travel worldwide. He stopped doing so after 2075 so has no recent travel out of the country. He is now employed by Applied Industrial Technologies as an accountant. \n\n\n\nHabits: Denies any history of tobacco use. Although he denied illicit drug use, his chart review revealed above noted history of cocaine abuse. He subsequently admitted to prior use, i.e. at parties while traveling. He denies related excessive ETOH use, use of other illicit drugs, or high risk sexual behaviors. He admits to 3 drinks per week currently. \n\n\n\n\tReview of systems:\n\n   As detailed in HPI. He has never had chest pain or pressure, palpitations, irregular heartbeat, presyncope, or syncope. He denies having had fever, chills, or acute viral illness preceding onset of symptoms, recent travel out of the country or history of tick bites, hepatitis, or TB. He has no known thyroid problems. Remaining ROS noncontributory. \n\n\n\nPhysical examination:\n\n\t\n\n-General:   Obese WM, somewhat anxious appearing in NAD. Intubated/sedated\n\n-Skin:   No rashes, nonicteric.\n\n-HEENT:   NC.

He denies any known drug\nallergies and at present, he is taking Feratab 300 mg\nt.i.d., Motrin 600 mg q.8h. p.r.n., Benadryl 50 mg q.h.s.\np.r.n., Zestril 5 mg q.d., glyburide 2.5 mg q.d., and\naspirin 325 mg q.o.d.  The patient has been followed fairly\nfrequently in the clinic recently for diabetic foot ulcers\non his right foot, between his 4th and 5th toe.  This\nevening, he presents with worsening ulcers in that area and\nalso a new ulcer between his 3rd and 4th toes.  It has not\nimproved with good skin care and application of bacitracin;\nin fact, it has worsened.\n\nREVIEW OF SYSTEMS: He denies any bleeding with brushing of\nhis teeth.  He denies any palpitations or chest pain.  He\ndenies any shortness of breath or cough.  He denies any\nnausea, vomiting, diarrhea, or constipation.  He states that\nhis bowel movements have become darkened secondary to his\niron intake.  He denies any symptoms of frequency or\nnocturia, no burning, itching, or pain with urination.  He\nstates that he has occasional elbow pain, which is relieved\nwith Motrin.\n\nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION: His temperature is 97.8 degrees, his\npulse is 88, his blood pressure is 135/65, weight is 141\npounds, and his random blood sugar is 159.  He states that\nhe did not take his medication today.  His heart has a\nregular rate and rhythm at 88.  Lungs are clear to\nauscultation bilaterally.  There are bruises noted on his\nright hand and left upper arm, but he states that both of\nthese were related to trauma.  Examination of his feet\nrevealed his toes to be more reddened and somewhat shiny,\nshinier than previous visits.  They were cool to touch.  On\nhis right foot, there was a new dime-sized blister on the\n4th toe, and the toe that bordered his 3rd toe, and on the\nother side.  There was an increase in the size on the toe\nulcer and also on the ulcer on his 5th toe.  Scant amount of\ndrainage was noted from the toe areas.  Mr. Nicholas Xavier\nis vigilant with his foot care and has been so.  This is\ndefinite worsening of his symptoms.  Posterior tibial pulses\nare present.\n\nASSESSMENT\n1. Noninsulin-dependent diabetes mellitus.\n2. Diabetic foot ulcers on 4th toe, both sides, and 5th toe.\n\nPLAN: Arterial vascular studies with Doppler imaging to be\ndone.  Referral to surgical clinic for evaluation of his\nulcers.  He was given a prescription for Xeroform gauze to\nbe used twice daily and dressing changes were explained to\nhim.  He was instructed to return to clinic in one month for\nfollowup.\n\n\n______________________________\nXimena Utter, NP\n\n\nCC:\n\neScription document:0-927126 PQ  Focus\n\nDD: 10/02/89\nDT: 10/03/89\nDV: 10/02/89\nRecord date: 2091-03-30\n\n\nORLH\n58 Kessler Farm Drive                                        NICHOLAS-XAVIER, FRED\nWhite Hall, MN 76715                                      65856594\n(959) 149-6104                                           03/30/91\n\n\nCHIEF COMPLAINT:  Mr. Nicholas Xavier is a 73-year-old man who\nreturns to the Orlando Regional today for a quick follow up on his\nleft foot ulceration.\n\nCURRENT MEDICATIONS:  Glucovance 5/500 mg b.i.d. and Actos 30 mg\nq.d.\n\nHISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The ulceration has not significantly\nchanged, but there are no new signs of infection.  He has been\ntaking Keflex 500 mg t.i.d. for the last seven days.  He denies\nfever and his blood glucose levels have started to improve a\nlittle bit.  His fingerstick blood sugar today is 145.\n\nHe has an appointment in Vascular Surgery in two days.

I have also reviewed with him that he may need\nto be hospitalized if a vascular procedure is recommended.\n\nUnfortunately, he does not have an appointment with Podiatry\nuntil the end of this month.\n\nASSESSMENT AND PLAN:  He will be seen by me again in a few days\nafter he is seen in Vascular Surgery.  In the meantime, he will\ncontinue with all his medications.

I followed him in the hospital \n\nwhen he was admitted in Apr for a left foot ulcer.  As you know, he is a 77 \n\nyear-old man from Eritrea with a history of diabetes, hypertension and \n\nhyperlipidemia, as well as peripheral vascular disease who has had bilateral \n\nlower extremity bypasses in the past. \n\n \n\nHe was admitted in Apr of 2091 with a nonhealing left lower extremity ulcer \n\nfor lower extremity redo bypass surgery.  His preoperative evaluation \n\nincluded \n\na Dobutamine echocardiogram, which revealed a small area of Dobutamine \n\ninduced \n\nhypokinesis in the inferior wall.  Since this was a small area, it was felt \n\nhe \n\ncould proceed with surgery with moderate risk on a beta-blocker.  He \n\nunderwent \n\nleft lower extremity peripheral bypass surgery and did well postoperative \n\nwith \n\nno symptoms of chest pain and no change in his EKG.\n\n \n\nHowever postoperative enzymes revealed peak CK of 455 with an MB fraction of \n\n35 and a troponin of 19.5.  As a result of his large troponin leak, he \n\nunderwent cardiac catheterization on Apr 15, 2091 which revealed an 80% left \n\nmain stenosis, 100% totally occluded left anterior descending coronary \n\nartery, \n\n100% proximal first diagonal and a 60-70% lesion at the ostium of the \n\nposterior descending coronary artery with about a 50% lesion in the distal \n\nPDA. \n\n \n\nPostoperative echocardiogram on Apr 13, 2091 revealed an ejection fraction of \n\n45% with _________ apical hypokinesis and mild mitral insufficiency.  Due to \n\nhis severe left main stenosis, he underwent coronary artery bypass grafting \n\non \n\nApr 20, 2091. He had LIMA to his left anterior descending artery and a vein \n\ngraft to his obtuse marginal artery.  He did not have a graft to his \n\nposterior \n\ndescending artery since he had a limit to the number of conduits secondary \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nNicholas-Xaviar, Fred\n\nMR #65856594\n\nMay 08, 2091\n\nPage Two\n\n \n\n \n\nto his multiple peripheral vascular surgeries.\n\n \n\nPostoperatively he did quite well and was discharged to rehabilitation on \n\nApril \n\n27, 2091.  His medications on discharge were aspirin 325mg, Zocor 20mg, \n\nSubcutaneous Heparin 5000 units b.i.d., Metformin 500mg, Glipizide 10 in the \n\nmorning and 5 in the evening, Captopril 12.5 t.i.d. and Lopressor 25mg q.i.d.\n\n \n\nSince that time, he has done quite well. He has been progressing at \n\nrehabilitation to the point that he is now walking ten minutes three times \n\nper \n\nday and is working on walking up stairs since he lives on the second floor of \n\nhis house.  He denies any chest pain with walking.  He has no shortness of \n\nbreath or dyspnea on exertion.  He has been sleeping on two pillows for a \n\nlong \n\ntime and this is unchanged.  He denies paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea or \n\nclaudication symptoms with walking at this time.  He does complain of some \n\npain in his left shin just below his knee, particularly with palpation. He \n\nhas \n\nplans to be discharged from rehabilitation in a few days.\n\nOn physical examination, his blood pressure is 135/80 with a heart rate of \n\n60. \n\n His jugular venous pressure is flat, and he has good carotid upstrokes \n\nwithout carotid bruits.  His lungs are clear to auscultation and percussion \n\nbilaterally.  His heart has a slight laterally displaced PMI with a regular \n\nrate and rhythm, normal S1, and S2 and no audible murmur or gallop.  His \n\nchest \n\nincision as well as his lower extremity and arm incisions is healing well. He \n\nhas a small scrape on the inner aspect of his left leg, which is also healing \n\nwell.  There is some red discoloration below this lesion that is not warm and \n\ndoes not appear to be cellulitic.  His feet are warm.\n\n \n\nHis EKG in my office reveals normal sinus rhythm at 60 with T wave inversions \n\nin V1 through V5, 1 and L.  They are particularly deep in V2 and V3 but are \n\nunchanged from his discharge EKG from the hospital.\n\n \n\nIn summary, Mr. Nicholas-Xaviar is a 77 year-old gentleman with diabetes, \n\nhypertension, hyperlipidemia, coronary artery disease and peripheral vascular \n\ndisease who is two weeks status post coronary artery bypass grafting and \n\nthree \n\nweeks left lower extremity bypass who is doing quite well in his recovery.  \n\nHe \n\nwill continue with rehabilitation and increase his exercise capacity over \n\ntime. I have reassured him and his granddaughter that he is doing very well \n\nand that it will take up to two months until he feels back to his baseline. \n\n \n\nI have recommended to him and to his rehabilitation facility that he increase \n\nhis Zocor from 20-40mg q.h.s.  I have also changed him to once daily cardiac \n\nregimen so I have changed his \n\n \n\n \n\nNicholas-Xaviar, Fred\n\nMR #65856594\n\nMay 08, 2091\n\nPage Three\n\n \n\n \n\nCaptopril to Lisinopril 20mg q.d. and his Lopressor to Toprol XL 100mg p.o. \n\nq.d..  He will follow up with me in three months time or sooner if he \n\ndevelops \n\nany new symptoms of chest pain, shortness of breath or any new cardiac \n\nconcerns.\n\n \n\nHe was seen, examined and discussed with Dr. Steve Franks.  Thank you for \n\nallowing me to participate in his care.\n\n \n\nSincerely, \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nOlivia Spence, M.D.DD: 05/08/91DT: 05/12/91DV: 05/08/91\n\n/piper\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n ******** Not reviewed by Attending Physician ********"}

I last\n\nsaw him in November of 2085.  In May he presented to the\n\nemergency room with dehydration and hyperglycemia.  Diagnosis of\n\nnon-insulin dependent diabetes mellitus was made.  He is now on\n\nGlyburide and metformin.  His renal function at that time was\n\nnormal with a BUN of 15 and creatinine of 0.90.  His potassium at\n\nthat time was 4.6.  Otherwise, he is doing pretty well.  He has\n\nlost about 40 lb.  He has seen a nutritionist regarding dietary\n\ncounseling.  \n\n \n\nToday his weight is 258 lb.  Blood pressure 120/80.  Heart rate\n\n100.  Current medications lisinopril 40 mg p.o. q.d.,\n\nhydrochlorothiazide 12.5 q.d., Glyburide 5 mg p.o. q.d.,\n\nmetformin 500 mg t.i.d., diltiazem 180 p.o. q.d.

Continue high water\n\nintake.  Encourage weight loss and compliance with his diet.  \n\n \n\nI spent some time talking to him about the importance of weight\n\nloss and controlling his diabetes given his underlying kidney\n\ndisease.

As you recall, he is a 57-year-old man with a history of diabetes, hypertension, dyslipidemia, and obesity, who initially presented with chest discomfort on 12/09/2092.  Mr. Tanner ruled out for myocardial infarction at that time and underwent stress testing, which was positive.  He returns today for diagnostic catheterization.  Cardiac catheterization revealed noncritical coronary artery disease with an approximately 50% ostial right coronary artery lesion in a left dominant system.  The right femoral arteriotomy site was manually compressed without complication.  Mr. Tanner was admitted to the Cardiovascular Unit overnight for observation.  Overnight he did well, specifically, he denied any chest pain, shortness of breath, groin, or flank pain.  He remained hemodynamically stable, and was ambulating, eating, and voiding without difficulty.\n\n\n\nOn examination, his cardiac exam revealed a regular rate and rhythm with normal S1 and S2.  Lungs were clear to auscultation throughout all lung fields.  His groin was soft and mildly tender with no hematoma and no bruit noted.  His lower extremities were warm and well perfused with intact distal pulses.\n\n\n\nHis morning labs were significant for sodium of 142, potassium of 4.1, BUN of 18, creatinine of 1.  A CBC revealed a white blood cell count of 4.74, hematocrit of 31.6, and platelets of 304,000.  A fasting lipid panel revealed total cholesterol of 107, triglycerides of 130, HDL of 30, and LDL of 51.\n\n\n\nWe are planning on discharging Mr. Tanner on the following medications, aspirin 81 mg daily, Lipitor 10 mg daily, diltiazem extended release 360 mg daily, Levoxyl 250 mcg daily, lisinopril 40 mg daily, NPH insulin 80 units subcutaneous daily, Avandia 4 mg daily, and metformin 850 mg twice daily to start on 12/21/2092.  We have asked that he follow up with you in the next one to two weeks, and to call with any questions or concerns before then.\n\n\n\nThank you for allowing us to share in the care of your patient, Mr. Yul Tanner.  If you have any questions, please do not hesitate to contact us regarding his ongoing management.\n\n\n\nSincerely,\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRebecca Eason, MD\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDictated by: Regan Montgomery, PA-C\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\neScription document:3-2644464 IFFocus\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDD: 12/20/92\n\nDT: 12/20/92\nDV: 12/20/92"}

Mrs. Foust is a 65-year-old woman who is feeling significantly improved, but who complains of dizziness after she takes her medications.  Her history of severe hypertension, without definite secondary causes, only a mild left renal artery stenosis, a recent admission for chest discomfort and hypertension, with a CTA that disclosed only modest plaques in her 3 major coronary arteries, treated dyslipidemia, type II diabetes, and vigorous left ventricular systolic function and significant left ventricular hypertrophy, is detailed above.  \n\n\nMs. Foust feels that her life has been brought back to her.  She takes her amlodipine, lisinopril, and carvedilol at 8:30 a.m.  Thirty minutes later, she states that she feels lightheaded and her blood pressure can be in the 100/70 mmHg range to 120/80 mmHg range.  She believes that her heart rate is approximately 60 beats per minute at those times.  After 1-2 hours, she starts to feel improved.  At 8:30 p.m., when she takes only her carvedilol and amlodipine, again, she has similar symptoms.  When she has the symptoms, she sometimes also notices a discomfort in her low back.  She has not had dyspnea and she has only rare episodes of mild chest heaviness.  She has not had palpitations.  She has not had actual lower extremity swelling, though she feels that after her metformin, her legs can feel heavy.  She is not having an alteration in gastrointestinal or genitourinary habits. She has not had musculoskeletal achiness, aside from the low back discomfort described.  She has not had any peripheral numbness.  The rest of the review of systems is unremarkable.  \n\n\nThe present medications are ASA 81 mg a.m., lisinopril 40 mg a.m., amlodipine one-half of a 10 mg tablet a.m., carvedilol 25 mg a.m. and 25 mg evening, simvastatin 40 mg before bedtime, and metformin 500 mg before dinner. \n\n\nOn examination, the weight is 110 pounds, decreased 3 pounds compared to 01/96.  The blood pressure was initially 136/60 mmHg with a heart rate of 60 beats per minute, respiratory rate 12, and she was complaining of low back discomfort, and she was very slightly lightheaded.  Later, the blood pressure was 160/70 mmHg and she stated that her blood pressure has not been so high for the last several weeks.  She was still complaining of slightly dizziness and low back discomfort.  The skin is warm and dry and she looks quite calm.  She is fully alert.  The neck veins are not elevated.  The carotid upstrokes are brisk and the volumes are normal.  There are no carotid bruits though there was a transmitted murmur.  The lungs are clear.  The PMI is not displaced.  There is a normal-sounding S1 and a physiologically split S2, with a soft, 2/6 early-peaking systolic murmur across the aortic valve that decreases with Valsalva.  The abdomen is benign. There is no renal artery bruit.  The distal pulses remain excellent and there is no pedal edema.  There is no tenderness of her skin.  The resting electrocardiogram shows a sinus bradycardia at a rate of 56 beats per minute, intervals of 0.20/0.08/0.40, 45-degree axis, very slight inferolateral ST segment flattening. \n\n\nImpression:  Mrs. Foust is feeling much-improved.  The dizziness and low back discomfort that she describes could possibly be associated with a drop in blood pressure to 170 mmHg, with mild hypoperfusion of her spinal arteries, as well as her head.  However, today she had dizziness even with a blood pressure of 160 mmHg.  Though we could be tempted to juggle with her regimen and reduce her amlodipine slightly, or change the times when she takes the medications, I think that we are facing some difficulties only related to the poor autoregulation of her cerebral and peripheral vessels.  I think that we should continue her on her present regimen.  Gradually, we would expect her symptoms, related to changes in blood pressure, to improve as her vessel elasticity improves.  I think that we can be satisfied that she is not becoming too bradycardic.  We are pleased with the present regimen.  We have never been absolutely certain that there has been no tiny penetrating aortic ulcer for her discomforts or so dramatic, but the treatment would be precisely as it is now.  We were not surprised by her CTA and her treatment, naturally, remains unchanged.  I think that we want her to continue her metformin, and we may have to consider increasing it to at least twice daily, depending on followup A1c values.  \n\n\nThank you for allowing me to assist in Mrs. Foust's care.  I know that you will continue to follow her closely.  I told her that I would see her again in nine months.  \n\n\nSincerely,\n\n\n\n\n______________________________\nStephen C Rice, M.D.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\neScription document:8-1475473\n\n\n\n\n\nDD: 03/18/96\nDT: 03/19/96\nDV: 03/18/96"}

He said he has been perfectly fine, in his usual self, when he went to the grocery store, although the days have been humid.  He has AC at home.  However, about 5-10 minutes before he fell, he felt    hot    and    sweaty   , but didn't think too much of it.  After finishing shopping in the store, he went out to the car to open the trunk, and while he was trying to put the key in the keyhole, he lost consciousness and fell to the ground. According to the witnesses at the scene (his sisters), he lost consciousness for about 1-2 minutes, and he quickly came back to himself but did not remember what had happened to him.  No head trauma.  \n\n\n\nOther than feeling hot and sweaty, he denied any chest pain, shortness of breath, palpitations, vision changes, focal limb weakness, slurring of speech, and bowel or bladder incontinence.

Syncope: Most likely etiology of his syncopal episode is vasovagal/ neurocardiogenic, considering the presence of prodromal symptoms (sweating, feeling warm) 5 minutes before the event.  It is possible that the patient has been dehydrated, considering the last couple days have been very humid, and he hasn't changed his fluid intake.  However, the sudden onset of his syncope and LOC for 1-2 minutes concerning for cardiogenic causes as well: including sinus brady and other arrhythmic events.  Ischemic event is less likely in this man.  EKG showed no significant changes compared to the previous one, and he has known MR evidenced on his TTE in 2090.\n\nOther possible causes include:\n\n  \tNeurologic: unlikely with no focal neuro symptoms both witnessed at the time and currently.  However, the possibilities include basilar insufficiency.\n\n  \tOthers: Finger stick glucose on the field 130, and Hct 36.8 (baseline) ruling out hypoglycemia and anemia as an etiology.  \n\nPlan:\n\n1)\tContinue hydration overnight. \n\n2)     Tele monitor to detect any abnormal heart rhythm.\n\n3)     Continue to rule out with enzymes to rule out ischemia.\n\n4)     TTE to assess any focal site for arrhythmogenic events.\n\n5)     TCD and carotid duplex ultrasound to rule out basilar insufficieny, although he displays no signs of it on physical exam.\n\n\n\n2. DM: Pt diagnosed with type 2 DM approximately 12 years ago.  Seems to be in a good control, with only diet and exercise modification.  Per pt, the last HgbA1c was in 5-6 range.  \n\n1)\tDiabetic diet, RSSI.\n\n2)     Q6h finger stick check.\n\n3)     Check HgbA1c in AM.\n\n\n\n3. L ankle swelling: Most likely from sprain while falling down during the syncope.  Tender to palpation and with joint movement.  No signs of infection.  Good peripheral pulses and intact sensations.\n\n1)\tL ankle plain films to rule out fracture.\n\n2)     PT consult.\n\n\n\n4. FEN: Electrolytes all within normal range, except slightly low Mg (1.5).  Eating PO.  On IVF for hydration.\n\n1)\tReplete Mg.  \n\n2)     K now 3.6.  If low in AM, replete for the goal of 4.\n\n3)     Diabetic diet for nutrition.\n\n\n\n5. Prophylaxis: Ranitidine, heparin. \n\n\n\n8. Dispo: PT consult.  Anticipate home discharge.\n\n______________________________________________________________________\n\nName     Shawn Ott                          \n\nPager \t# 56770\n\nPGY-1\nRecord date: 2092-10-11\n\n \n\n\n\nInternal Medicine - MSIII Admission Note\n\n\n\nPt: Crawford, Patrick (Mary 3562Z)\n\nMR#: \t902-15-55\n\nDate of Admission: 10/10/92\n\nAttending: \tYancey, Ursula\n\nPCP: Estep, Willa\n\nCode status: Full\n\n\n\n\n\nCC:  Generalized weakness + diaphoresis\n\n\n\nHPI:  Pt is an 82 yo man with a history of diet-controlled DM2, HTN, and a syncopal episode 1mo ago who presents with an episode of profuse diaphoresis and generalized weakness while cooking in his home at 10am this morning.  He had recently returned home from grocery shopping, carrying 6 bags of groceries up 1 flight to his apartment, and was moving about his kitchen cooking when he felt suddenly drenched in sweat.  He immediately felt lightheaded, disoriented, nauseous, generally weak, and as though he was about to faint.  He was able to walk a few steps, sit down, and rest for 15-20min before he realized his symptoms weren't resolving, called his sister, and put his head on the table and felt he could not really move because he was so weak.  He denied any CP, SOB, palpitations, flushes, fever/chills, HA, visual changes, vomiting, and focal weakness associated with the episode.  He felt he had been drinking adequate fluids, had no recent infections/cough/rhinorrhea, had no weight loss, and no exposures.  When his sister arrived he told her to call 911, and soon he was brought to the SOH ED.\n\n\n\nOne month PTA, Mr. Crawford had been in his usual state of health when he had his first ever feeling of lightheadedness and diaphoresis while grocery shopping.  Five minutes later while getting into his car, he had increasing lightheadedness and lost consciousness, falling to the ground with no head trauma.  As with today's episode, he denied prior CP, SOB, palpitations and other symptoms previously listed.  According to his sisters who were present at the time, he regained consciousness 2 minutes later, and he recalls knowing exactly where he was but not what had happened to him.  He did not lose continence of bladder or bowel.  He was brought to the ED, where his vitals were stable with a BP of 126/61 and HR 66, and was admitted for observation and workup.  Head CT was negative for an acute process, CXR was clear, EKG showed some LA enlargement and mild ST / Twave changes consistent with an EKG of 2yrs ago, negative cardiac enzymes, and a cardiac echo showing mild MR, an elongated LA, and an EF of 68%.  At the time of discharge he was instructed to stop taking Prazosin for his BPH and instead take Flomax.\n\n\n\nIn the past month, Mr. Crawford has had no repeat syncopal episodes, but many episodes of diaphoresis with very mild lightheadedness.  He reports that at least every few days he either has a brief diaphoresis episode during his daily activities, or sometimes a profuse diaphoresis that can occur while lying in bed and causing him to change his clothes and bedsheets.  He has had no other symptoms.  Of note, this morning he had run out of Flomax due to an insurance issue, and resumed taking 4mg of leftover Prazosin for his BPH around 6am.  He disliked the Flomax because it seemed to cause polyuria and generally made him feel 'off' in an unidentifiable way.  Currently the pt feels slightly lightheaded/'woozy', sometimes worse with positional changes, and still generally weak, with no other symptoms.\n\n\n\nPMH: \t- DM2: diagnosed 2080, initially took an oral hypoglycemic agent for 6mo, but since has been managed by diet and exercise only.

Episode occurred in setting of frequent diaphoresis episodes in the past 1mo, and with medication change from Flomax to Prazosin this morning 4hrs prior to current episode.  No LOC, CP, SOB, or seizure-like activity.  No focal deficits and non-orthostatic on exam with strength intact.  Stable Hct.  Likely etiologies include:\n\n\n\n1.\tArrhythmia, including sick sinus.  EKGs demonstrate mild LA enlargement, old V1/V2 Q waves.  Could predispose to atrial fib or conduction abnormalities.  Sick sinus not seen on EKG, but common cause of pre-syncope.\n\n\n\n2.\tVertebrobasilar/Carotid stenosis.  Basilar territory could lead to dizziness; would expect more focal findings if carotid etiology, unless bilateral blockage.\n\n\n\n3.\tPrazosin-induced hypotension.  In light of very recent change back to Prazosin, which has more vascular/peripheral alpha-1 antagonism than does the more prostate-specific Flomax, could result in cerebral hypoperfusion.\n\n\n\n4.\tNeurocardiogenic/Carotid hypersensitivity.\n\n\n\n\n\nPlan:\n\n\n\nPre-syncope:\t- ROMI with 2nd and 3rd set of cardiac markers\n\n\t\t- Telemetry\n\n\t\t- 24 hr Holter monitor\n\n\t\t- Carotid Doppler and Posterior Transcranial Doppler\n\n\t\t- Check lytes, CBC + diff in a.m.\n\n\t\t- IVF: NS 500cc at 75cc/hr\n\n\t\t- Continue Lisinopril, HCTZ but discontinue Prazosin as inpatient\n\n\t\t- ASA qod as at home, consider    qd\n\n\n\nDM2:\t\t- Check glucose in a.m.\n\n\t\t- No insulin requirement; order diabetic diet\n\n\n\nOA:\t\t- Motrin 400mg bid; check BUN/Cr and U/A for evidence of AIN or ATN\n\n\n\nGout:\t\t- Continue Allopurinol\n\n\n\nOptho:\t\t- Continue home regimen of Truopt, Artificial tears, etc.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n_______________________________\n\nLeon Xayachack \n\nPager #76680\n\n\n\nI have seen and examined the patient wtih Leon and agree with his assessment.\nRecord date: 2094-04-16\n\n \nInternal Medicine Admission Note\n\nName: Crawford, Patrick\nMR#:  9021555\nDate of Admission: 04.15.94 \nPCP: Ehlers, Willa\nAttending: Ward\nAdmitting Resident: Kimberly Ring\n\nCC: 83 y/o man w/ known CAD presenting with near syncope\n\nHPI:  \n83 y/o man w/ CAD, (no stents), followed by Dr. Youmans, presents after an episode of diaphoresis and    upchucking    after helping his sister clean out the water in her basement (this happened Saturday am). Of note, he had one episode of diarrhea that morning. He denied any fevers or chills, or nausea or vomiting prior to this episode. When he started vigorously removing the water from the floor, he began feeling lightheaded and nauseated, and was told he was diaphoretic. He sat down on the stairs with assistance from the plumber, and    upchucked.    After vomiting he still felt dizzy and lightheaded. Ems was called, and upon arrival at the ED, he had another episode of diarrhea. At no point did he have chest pain. He did not lose consciousness. This felt somewhat similar to an episode of near syncope he had in 2092. \nIn general, he is limited in his activity by his osteoarthritis. However, he walks up stairs regularly and gardens without chest pain. The only new medicine change is an increase in his norvasc. He has not been experiencing any palpitations, or shortness of breath. He denies any headache, visual changes, dysuria, abdominal pain, sore throat. He has heard that there is a bug going around, but denies sick contacts. \nED Course:\nUpon presentation to ED, HR 50, BP 141/62, 18, 99% RA, afebrile. Given aspirin, home meds, beta blocker held for bradycardia. Decided to admit despite negative troponins and no EKG changes because symptoms of dizziness when walking persisted. \n\nROS: \nNegative in detail; positives noted in HPI. \n\nMedical History:\n1. CAD: Adenosine mibi showed reversible, moderate, anteroseptal defect. Cath 10/92 with mild to moderate LAD (focal 50% stenosis in proximal third; focal 50% stenosis of mid third at ostia of second diaganol artery) and RCA (proximal RCA w/ 50% stenosis in distal third) disease; interrogation with pressure wire of LAD lesion revealed non-hemodynamically signficiant lesion. Discharged from SDU on med management (beta blocker, asa, ace, and statin), with f/u w/ Dr. Youmans (who has followed since).\n2. Syncope: Admitted twice 2092, first attributed to alpha blocker and dehydration, second time ruled out, but had positive adenosine mibi (see above)\n. - \t3. DM2: diagnosed 2080, initially took an oral hypoglycemic agent for 6mo, but since has been managed by diet and exercise only.  HbA1c checked q3mo; most recent was around 5.0 per pt.\n4. Hypertension\n5. Hypercholesterolemia\n6. TIA workup 8/2090 after p/w sensation of burning tongue, metallic taste, some diminished hearing on L, had negative head CT at OSH per pt\n7. Vertigo: dx in 10/2090, described as dizziness/room spinning.  No subsequent episodes.  Negative CTA of the head/neck at SOH.\n8. BPH\n9. Lung cancer, s/p L lobectomy (middle and lower lobes) in 2072, did not require chemotherapy or radiation\n10. OA, s/p R total hip replacement (2086)\n11. Gout: involves L big toe, but with rare flares\n12. Glaucoma OU\n13.  Cataracts OU, s/p cataract surgery\n14. Double hernia repair 6/85\n15. S/p shrapnel injury to L side of body during the war, reports retained shrapnel near C-spine, L arm, scalp.  Has no permanent injury, but did limp for awhile after being injured which has resolved.\n16. Herpes zoster flare 15yrs ago\n17.

Plan\n83 y/o man with known CAD, diabetes, hypertension, hyperlipidemia who presents with near syncope, as well as vomiting. Certainly in someone with known CAD, cardiogenic near-syncope is most concerning, namely, MI, with atypical features. However, his EKG is unchanged, his troponins are negative, and he never had chest pain. Perhaps his light-headedness is secondary to bradycardia, as his heart rate has been in the 50s and 60s. However, I think the most likely explanation is that he has a bit of gastroenteritis, was dehydrated, and had a vasovagal response in the setting of exertion. It is worth checking orthostatics given his rigorous blood pressure regimen. There is nothing to suggest seizure or other neurologic etiologies given his story.\n\nSyncope: Stable, no longer feeling dizzy or nauseated\nAdmit to telemetry and monitor overnight\nHas completed MI r/o\nContinue ASA, beta blocker, (w/ hold parameters), statin, ACE\nHas close follow up w/ Dr. Youmans (next week), and likely does not need repeat stress test while in house\nCAD: As above, will d/c on 50 PO Toprol BID per Dr. Youmans    recommendations\nDiabetes: Diet controlled at home\nRISS while in house with BID fingersticks to assess glucose control\nElevated WBC: Likely 2/2 gastroenteritis.

His cardiovascular issues include prior syncope, nonobstructive coronary disease, and hypertension. In the interval, since our last visit, he has done well from a CV perspective. He has had no episodes of chest pain, pressure, tightness, orthopnea, PND, progressive lower extremity swelling, or claudication. He did unfortunately have an episode of diverticulosis requiring hospitalization at Oakcrest Nursing Home. He did not require transfusion. The bleeding sounds as though it was self-limiting and has not recurred. Otherwise, his health is unchanged.

On the last visit he was having \nchest pain and was therefore sent to the Emergency Room for a further \nevaluation.  At that time he had EKGs which did not demonstrate any \nischemia during his chest pain and a chest x-ray which was unremarkable.  \nThe Emergency Room physicians contacted his doctors at Humbert Hospital and obtained a history that the patient had a cardiomyopathy in \nthe past with a decreased LV function.  However repeat echo within the \npast months demonstrated good LV function and they were in the process \nof performing further cardiac testing when the patient left the \nHumbert Hospital against medical advice.  After being evaluated in the \nEmergency Room at Pontiac State, he now returns to be tied in with \nthe Internal Medicine clinic.  \n \nMedications:  His medications since his Emergency Room visit include \nCarafate 1 gm. PO q.i.d., Prinivil 10 mg. PO q.d., Tenormin 50 mg. PO \nq.d., Motrin 600 mg. t.i.d. p.r.n. and Nitrostat tablets p.r.n.  His \ninsulin dosing consists of 40 units of NPH q.a.m. and 18 units q.p.m. \nand regular insulin 20 units q.a.m.  \n \nOn return to my office today, he states that the frequency of his chest \npain is much diminished but that he has gained some weight since \ndiscontinuing his Lasix per order of the Emergency Room physicians.\n \nPhysical Exam:  On exam, his blood pressure is 160/100 with a heart rate \nof 76.  He is not in any acute distress.  His chest is clear to \nauscultation.  His cardiac exam demonstrates S4 gallop and distant heart \nsounds.  His abdominal exam is benign except for massive obesity.  His \nrectal exam is guaiac negative.  His extremities exam demonstrates 1+ \npitting edema to the shins and his neurologic exam is unremarkable.  \n \nAssessment and Plan:  \n \n1.   Cardiac.  The patient will be scheduled for an ETT thallium study \n     to rule out ischemia.\n \n2.   Hypertension.  His Prinivil will be increased to 20 mg. q.d.\n \n3.   Diabetes.  His sugars have been running 130 to 160 by fingerstick \n     checks at home and he will continue his present regimen.\n \n4.   The patient will be referred to ophthalmology for the evaluation of \n     his eyes given his history of hypertension and diabetes.\n \n5.   General.  The patient will see me shortly after completion of an \n     ETT thallium study for further discussion of his cardiac status.\n \n_________________________\nMichael Holman, M.D.\n \nrin:KZ:9636:DD:11-24-78:DT:11-25-78:DV:11-22-78\nRecord date: 2079-07-21\n\nPONTIAC INTERNAL MEDICINE ASSOCIATES          Sherman, Andrew\n                                              7-21-79\n \n \n \nHistory of Present Illness:  Mr. Sherman is a patient well known to \nme.  I have seen him on multiple occasions for his coronary artery \ndisease, hypertension, and diabetes.  The patient has had a positive \nexercise tolerance test recently and was seen by Cardiology who felt \nthat he should undergo cardiac catheterization.  However, patient was \noverweight and the decision was made for him to reduce his weight by \napproximately 50 lb. at which time he would be suitable for cardiac \ncatheterization on the Pontiac equipment.  Patient was seen last night \nin the Pontiac Emergency Room with a several day history of back pain \nwhich began in the middle of his back and has subsequently become right \nflank pain which is persistent and colicky in nature.  \n \nOn exam in the Emergency Room he was noted to be afebrile.  His exam was \nnotable for CVA tenderness and an exam highly suspicious of renal colic.  \nHis EKG was unremarkable and his laboratory exam was unremarkable as \nwell.  His urinalysis did not demonstrate any red blood cells, however, \ndid have 3+ uric acid crystals with a normal uric acid blood level.  An \nabdominal ultrasound was ordered which was unremarkable except for the \npresence of his slight abnormality in the right pole of a kidney.  IVP \nwas recommended by the radiologist for follow-up.  He was given Toradol \nin the Emergency Room with minimal improvement and sent home with some \nMotrin with the follow-up to be by me in Internal Medicine Clinic.  I was called by \nthe patient this morning complaining of worsening pain in his right \nflank.  On it, patient states he is unable to get out of bed and was \nbrought to the Pontiac State Hospital to my Internal Medicine Clinic.  On exam \nhe was afebrile and his exam was notable for a right CVA tenderness with \npain radiating around to his abdomen and exacerbated by pushing on his \nabdomen.  Patient has good bowel sounds throughout and there are no \nperitoneal signs.\n \nAssessment and Plan:  While I am concerned about his possible renal \npathology I believe that there is a significant chance that this may be \nmusculoskeletal in nature, however, due to his other medical problems I \nfeel that an intravenous pyelogram is definitely indicated and he will \nundergo this study this afternoon.  I have also sent off a repeat CBC \nwith differential, a repeat urinalysis and amylase and lipase levels to \nrule out pancreatitis.  Of note, patient does have a history of peptic \nulcer disease, however, he was guaiac negative in the Emergency Room and \nreports no episodes of hematemesis, hematochezia, or melena.  He is also \nstatus post cholecystectomy.  I will review his IVP later today and make \nfurther therapeutic interventions at that time.\n \n \n_________________________\nMichael Holman, M.D.\n \nAE:JP:5824:DD:7-21-79:DT:7-24-79\nDV:7-21-79\nRecord date: 2093-05-23\n\nInternal Medicine ADMISSION NOTE\n\n\n\nPatient Name: \tSHERMAN, ANDREW\n\nMedical Record #: \t149-05-69\n\nDate of Admission: \t04/01/2091\n\nAttending: Younce\n\nPCP: Sacred Heart\nCardiologist: None\n\n\n\nID/CC:  60yoM w/ PMH CAD, 2vCABG, s/p AICD placement, CHF, DM, CVA p/w syncopal event.\n\n\n\nHPI:  Mr. Sherman is a 60yoM with MMP who was traveling in his wheelchair when he states that he lost consciousness and fell out of his wheelchair.

As you know, I did see her back in September where she was diagnosed with possible right-sided eustachian tube dysfunction.  Her blood sugars have been under reasonably good control, 88 and then 300.  She reports that her hearing has continued to fluctuate.  When questioned, she reports that she only used the nose spray twice since I did prescribe it.\n\nOn examination today, she otherwise appears well.  Ears are unremarkable.  Her eardrums are intact.  She has no tympanosclerosis or cholesteatoma.  Her gait is normal.  There is no nystagmus.\n\nAn audiogram done today does show a sloping high frequency sensorineural hearing loss, which is symmetric.  Her discrimination scores are 100% in the right ear and 100% in the left ear.\n\nAssessment:  Mild ear fullness with dysequilibrium and blockage.\n\nPlan:  She does take multiple medications.  It continues to be very unclear to me what her underlying causality is.  I would like her to use the nasal spray more consistently.  If she does fail this and this is not eustachian tube dysfunction, I would consider her to have endolymphatic hydrops.  This would respond hopefully to a diuretic and potassium supplementation.  However, she has taken multiple medications currently for both blood pressure including atenolol, Cozaar, Lasix, and verapamil.

Thank you for your kind referral. I will summarize his history and physical examination for my own records.  \n \nMr. Emery is a 86-year-old right-handed gentleman who is referred with complaint and electrophysiologic findings consistent with a generalized sensory motor polyneuropathy. His symptoms began a number of years ago when he noticed bilateral loss of sensation at the tips of his fingers in the hands. This had extended over several months to include his feet as well. Over many months to years he has noticed a weakness of his grip bilaterally, which over the more recent period of time encompassing the last year has been worse on the left. At one time that grip weakness was ascribed to possible carpal tunnel syndrome and he underwent a right carpal tunnel release on the right approximately four years ago. Three weeks ago he underwent a left carpal tunnel release for these same symptoms. He has had no falls, but does note some unsteadiness on his feet. He has had no sensations of tingling or loss of sensory stimulus around his face. He has had no diplopia, dysarthria, dysphagia, or bowel or bladder complaints that might be related to  neurologic problems. He has occasional shortness of breath on exertion. Otherwise, the remainder of his medical and neurologic review of systems is unremarkable.  \n \nPast medical history is significant for a past episode of urethral stones, history of lymphoma of unclear type by the medical record but would appear to be non-Hodgkins. He is undergoing extensive surveillance on a yearly basis for recurrence. He has a history of prostate hypertrophy, hypertension, and longstanding history of noninsulin-dependent diabetes since the age of 50. His glucose control by his history has been very good. He has lumbar back pain, a history of a heart murmur.  \n \nCurrent medications include aspirin, Cozaar, clopamide, Triamterene, Tenormin, and Glucophage.  \n \nHe has no known drug allergies.  \n \nHe does not smoke, uses alcohol socially, lives in Juneau South, has no obvious toxin exposure to heavy metals.  \n \nHis family history is negative for obvious neuromuscular disease.  He had a brother who died in his 50s of some sort of brain infection. He has several children, all in good health.   \nOn my examination today, he is alert and well appearing, with good concentration, memory, and language function. No carotid bruits could be appreciated. The peripheral vascular examination revealed weak pulses in all four limbs.  \n \nHe had full extraocular motility, with normal visual fields bilaterally. Funduscopy was normal bilaterally. Pupillary reflexes were intact to both light and near stimulation.  The muscles of facial expression, mastication, and the lower bulbar musculature were intact bilaterally.  Facial sensation was intact bilaterally to light touch.  \n \nOn motor examination, occasional fasciculations were seen throughout. There was clear wasting of the intrinsic muscles of the hands bilaterally, and trace weakness at IV+/V by MRC criteria in a symmetric distribution of the hands bilaterally.  Otherwise, muscles of the proximal shoulder girdle, forearm, and upper arm were V/V bilaterally. In the lower extremities, again, distal muscle wasting was noted, although power in all muscle groups was full.  \n \nSensation testing revealed a moderate-to-severe deficit in vibratory and joint position sense distally in the lower extremities. Temperature, pinprick and light touch sensation appeared to be intact.  \n \nThere was no dysmetria on finger-nose-finger testing, and gait was not ataxic. Romberg was slightly positive with sway but no fall.  \n \nDeep tendon reflexes were hyporeflexic throughout. Specifically I+ reflexes were elicited in the patellar tendons in a symmetric distribution, trace ankle jerks were elicited, and I+ reflexes were elicited in the biceps, triceps, and brachioradialis. There was no jaw jerk. Toes were downgoing bilaterally.  \n \nMr. Emery has already undergone EMG nerve conduction study recently at this institution. Those results were available for me today. They are consistent with a generalized axonal sensory motor polyneuropathy, which is moderate in distal extremities.  Both active and chronic denervation changes are seen on the EMG.  There is no evidence for demyelinating phenotype, and nerve conduction does reveal a conduction block at common sites of compression of the median nerve in the wrist, consistent with carpal tunnel syndrome.  \n \nGiven the apparent chronic nature of Mr. Emery's complaints, an axonal sensory motor neuropathy most likely idiopathic in origin, or more probably related to the diabetes is the likely diagnosis.  With respect to the weakness in the hands, which appears to encompass more muscle groups than would be accounted for by a median nerve compression at the wrist, this is likely the consequence of this longstanding axonal degeneration. There is no abnormality on the history, examination, or current electrophysiology that would lead me to suspect this is anything more unusual. In addition to the diabetes, of course the primary concern would be lymphoma-related neuropathy, either related to direct lymphomatous invasion of the perineurium, or more  often as a perineoplastic phenomenon. The very chronic nature of his symptoms would argue against this as a likely etiology, and he is, of course, undergoing extensive surveillance for such a recurrence. I would not think that his current symptomatology would be any cause for greater concern regarding new recurrence of  his illness.  \n \nUnfortunately, as you know, we are not able to offer anything in the way of therapy for this at this time. We can certainly treat any positive symptoms of painful dysesthesias fairly effectively with antineuropathic pain medications such as Amitriptyline, Gabapentin, or sodium channel agents such as phenytoin or _____.  However, this is not a prominent complaint of Mr. Emery's and this is not likely to be helpful for him. Nevertheless, there may be other therapies in the near future that might be available for this type of problem. I will be happy to continue to see Mr.  Emery on a roughly yearly basis, so that he can keep in touch and be made aware of any therapy that might be helpful and available for him in the future.  \n \nIf you have any questions please do not hesitate to call me. Once again, thank you for your kind referral.  \n \nSincerely, \n \n \n \nIgor Velazquez, M.D., Ph.D.  \n \n \n \nDD:05/05/2095 \nDT:05/05/2095 \nWK:65255     :4653\nRecord date: 2096-12-29\n\n\n\nNMH GU\n\nDonn Emery\nNMH#:  059-57-26\n\nDecember 29, 2096\n\nINTERVAL HISTORY:\n\nHe has been troubled by increasing shortness of breath, which Dr. Pina, the physician covering for Dr. Park, thought might be related to asbestosis.  He is to see her next on January 15, 2097. \n\nREVIEW OF SYSTEMS:\n\nGeneral:  Complaint of mild fatigue.  No fevers, chills, or change in appetite.\nHEENT:  No blurred vision, oral ulcers, lesions, thrush, neck swelling, neck stiffness, hoarseness.\nPulmonary:  No cough, SOB, DOE, hemoptysis, wheezing. \nCardiac:  No chest pain, palpitations.\nGastrointestinal:  No nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, constipation, or abdominal pain.  \nUrologic:  No dysuria, hematuria.\nLymph Nodes:  No enlarged lymph nodes.\nMusculoskeletal:  No back pain, neck pain, leg pain, or arm pain.\nHematologic:  No bruising, bleeding or clotting.\nNeurologic:  The neuropathy has become much worse, the left hand worse than the right.  He said that Dr. Pina thought that was likely secondary to his diabetes and made some changes in his medications.  He has had some moderately severe back pain.  \n\nREVIEW OF STUDIES:\n\nBlood studies on November 14, 2096 were satisfactory except for a BUN of 41 with a creatinine of 1.3.  I assume that that will be part of the checking up, which Dr. Pina will be doing.  A chest CT scan on December 22, 2096 showed no change in the small mediastinal nodes, but I will plan, just to be sure, to do a chest CT scan and an abdominal CT scan in six months.  If those studies are stable and satisfactory, I discussed with Mr. Emery the fact that I may not do scans subsequently given the absence of activity of lymphoma, the importance of his other medical conditions, and his advancing age.  \n\nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  \n\nWeight:  175 lb. with shoes.\nBlood Pressure:  I did not record a blood pressure, as it was above 160 and because of difficulties getting an accurate reading with a digital machine.  He is to have this checked by Dr. Pina.  \nSkin:  Normal.\nLymph Nodes:  There was no cervical, axillary, or inguinal lymphadenopathy.  There is an abnormality in the medial left supraclavicular fossa unchanged from several previous examinations.\nLungs:  Clear. \nHeart:  Normal.\nAbdomen:  No masses or tenderness.\nExtremities:  No evidence of DVT.  No edema.\nRectal Exam:  On rectal exam, the prostate was small, without abnormalities. \n\nIMPRESSION:  \n\nHe is having considerable difficulties, which relate both to physical issues described above and the fact that he is living alone.  His wife is in a care facility, which cares for individuals with Alzheimer s disease and this also has taken its toll on him overall.\n\nI will see him next in six months. \n\n\nConnor Quincy, MD\n\ncc:\tPatrick Park, MD\n\tDr. Pina \n\n\nCQ/earley\t\t65-77827705.doc\n\nNote:  The duration of this visit was 25 minutes with the majority of the time spent in counseling the patient, including a discussion of the current status of his condition.\nRecord date: 2098-11-04\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNAME:    Emmery, Donn S. \n\nMRN:     0595726 \n\n\n\nPatient presents today for nail care. It is an initial visit for him with me. He had seen\n\nDr. Noah Velazquez back in July of this year.  \n\n\n\nPAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Multiple and complex, consistent of hypertension,\n\ndiabetes, macular degeneration, aortic stenosis, lymphoma, anemia, polyneuropathy,\n\npositive ANA nuclear bodies, pulmonary fibrosis, asbestosis, history of SOB, GERD.\n\n\n\nMEDICATIONS: Multiple meds per the LMR. \n\n\n\nALLERGIES: Sulfa medications - urticaria.\n\n\n\nPAST SURGICAL HISTORY: Tonsillectomy, removal of nephrolithiasis, TURP,\n\nelectrocardiograms, carpal tunnel syndrome.\n\n\n\nPEDAL EXAM: Pulses are diminished bilaterally, absent digital hair growth, cool\n\natrophic skin. Sensorium appears intact. Orthopedically speaking, he has a severe pes\n\nplanus deformity bilaterally with forefoot abductus and collapse of the medial column,\n\nleft greater than right. Dermatologically speaking, there are no callosities. His nails\n\nare grossly dystrophic and elongated. They were all trimmed. There were no signs of\n\ninfection. Web spaces were clean, dry and intact. \n\n\n\nASSESSMENT: Patient with peripheral vascular disease. I recommended regular nail\n\ncare approximately every 2-3 months. I answered all of his questions. He was\n\nreappointed as stated.\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNoah X.

Would D/C it in favor of NPH 15 U in AM (watch carefully today since there is persistent Lantus effect). Check QID BS but cover with scale only before  breakfast and supper. I have not addressed the issue of long term insulin use with him, although it would be my first choice. Even at his age, I suspect that he would have no difficulty mastering it given his relatively youthful mind. Other alternatives would be sulfonylureas (if forced to use one, would choose glimepiride) and glitinides, for example repaglinide.\n\n\n\nThanks. Will follow. \n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tDaniel M.

When he got up again, he was again unsteady and lightheaded.  When he shuts his eyes, he says he has \"spinning\" sensation.  He took meclizine which did not help.  He has meclizine b/c he has had peripheral vertigo in the past.  He says that the dizziness he had today was different from that.  He had nausea but no vomiting.  He also had ringing in his ears and \"blurry\" vision and a \"tingling\" in the back of his head with face flushing during this episode.\n\n\n\n2d ago, he was watching TV and noted blurry vision.

The patient was last seen in outpatient vascular medicine follow-up by Dr. Levi Barton at the OAC 04/09/2078, at which time he reported recurrent and persistent BLE claudication symptoms, RLE > LLE, with pain in his buttocks, thighs, and calves with ambulation.  He reports that these symptoms, coupled with his peripheral neuropathy symptoms, have become quite debilitating and lifestyle-limiting.  The patient denies any chronic or poorly-healing ulcers or sores on his feet or lower extremities.  Given his history and symptomatic complaints, Dr. Barton recommended that the patient be scheduled to undergo an elective peripheral arteriogram to re-assess his PAD and, if indicated and feasible, to pursue percutaneous revascularization.  The patient had previously undergone a peripheral angiogram at the OAC on 11/21/2077, performed by Dr. Barton, which culminated in PTA and stenting to the R EIA and the distal L SFA, the former with a balloon-expandable biliary stent and the latter with a self-expanding biliary stent.  Follow-up lower extremity non-invasive studies performed at the OAC in 01/2078 revealed a depressed resting ABI of 0.70 in the RLE, which dropped to 0.24 following exercise (as well as a resting ABI of 1.00 in the LLE which decreased to 0.50 post-exercise).  The patient has not been treated with Pletal in the past.  An important side note is the fact that the patient's diagnostic LHC procedure at the OAC in 10/2077 revealed significant 4-vessel CAD, which for some reason was treated medically rather than surgically or percutaneously.  The patient has expressed a desire to have his coronary arteries re-assessed by angiography during today's peripheral catheterization procedure, not particularly because of any recurrent CP but mostly out of concern that his CAD may have worsened and because he may undergo surgery for his L ulnar nerve compression in the relatively near future. \n\n\n\n\tPast medical history:\n\n   1.   Hypertension (managed with chronic beta-blocker and ACE-inhibitor medications).\n\n2.   Hyperlipidemia (managed with a chronic \"statin\" medication).\n\n3.

Angiographic Results:  Contrast Volume:  200 cc of Isovue iodinated contrast media.   Fluoroscopy Time:  26.3 minutes.   Vascular Closure Device:  None used.   \n\n\n\nLower Extremity Non-Invasive Studies (01/15/2078, at the OAC):\n\nStudy included PVRs, segmental pressures, ABIs, and Duplex U/S.  Depressed resting ABI in the RLE (0.70).  Overall normal resting ABI in the LLE (1.00).  Significant decrease in the post-exercise ABI in the RLE (0.24).  Mild-to-moderate decrease in the post-exercise ABI in the LLE (0.50).  Duplex U/S of the previously-stented distal L SFA revealed mild-to-moderately elevated blood flow velocities in the proximal portion of the stent (PSV 178 cm/sec), with normal velocities at the distal end of the stent (PSV 73 cm/sec).  Duplex U/S also revealed revealed significantly elevated blood flow velocities in the proximal L PFA (PSV 306 cm/sec), as well as moderately elevated velocities in the proximal-to-mid L SFA (PSV 191 cm/sec).  Findings consistent with hemodynamically significant PAD of the BLEs.    \n\n\n\n\tAssessment and plan:\n\n   ASSESSMENT:\n\n63 y/o male patient with a h/o HTN, HLP, non-revascularized 4-vessel CAD, preserved LV systolic function, PAD with past PTA and stenting to the R EIA and distal L SFA, tobacco abuse, type 2 DM, peripheral neuropathy, L ulnar nerve compression, ulcerative colitis, GERD, depressive disorder, anxiety disorder, and gouty arthritis who presents to the OAC Cath Lab today for the purpose of undergoing a scheduled elective peripheral arterial catheterization procedure because of recurrent BLE claudication symptoms (RLE > LLE).  In addition, a diagnostic coronary angiogram will most likely be performed as well, particularly because of the patient's known unrevascularized multi-vessel CAD and the likelihood that he may undergo surgery in the relatively near future for his L ulnar nerve compression.  The patient is presently asymptomatic at rest, hemodynamically stable, in sinus rhythm, well-oxygenated on room air, in no distress, and ready to proceed with his scheduled elective catheterization procedure today.\n\n\n\n\n\nPLAN:\n\n1.   Proceed with the planned catheterization procedure this morning, which will include coronary angiography and BLE peripheral angiography (+/- possible percutaneous revascularization).\n\n2.   Informed written consent obtained from the patient (by one of the peripheral vascular interventional fellow) pre-procedure this morning.\n\n3.   No pre-medication for renal and/or allergy prophylaxis appears clinically warranted prior to angiography.\n\n4.   Admit the patient to the OAC on the inpatient service of Dr. Barton post-procedure.\n\n5.   Continue the patient on his same prior regimen and doses of ECASA, Plavix, Toprol-XL, Lisinopril, and Zocor.  \n\n6.   Continue holding the patient's prior Metformin for 48 hours following contrast administration during angiography today.\n\n7.   Monitor the patient's FSBG values and covering with sliding scale regular insulin as needed for episodes of hyperglycemia.\n\n8.   Continue the patient on Glipizide, a PPI (Prilosec in place of his usual Protonix while at the OAC [formulary limitations]), Neurontin, Effexor, Chantix, Hytrin, and Vitamin-B12.\n\n9.   Lab testing tomorrow morning should include the following:   CBC, Chem-7, Mg, CPKs, HS-CRP, Lipoprotein(a), and Homocysteine.\n\n10.   Discharge timing will depend upon today's procedural findings and events, the patient's peri- and post-catheterization course, and the potential need for further monitoring, testing, or treatment in the inpatient setting.\n\n11.   Following his hospital discharge, the patient should see Dr. Barton in outpatient vascular medicine follow-up in approximately 4 - 6 weeks, with follow-up lower extremity non-invasive studies (particularly resting and post-exercise ABIs) at that time.\n\n12.   Will re-address with Dr. Barton the need to consider the patient's need for coronary arterial revascularization, either percutaneously or surgically, given the severity and multi-vessel involvement.\n\n13.   Further plans and recommendations as per Dr. Barton.\n\n\n\n\n\nIsaac W.

Exercise ABI's revealed R ABI drop from 0.65 to 0.16 and L ABI drop from 0.74 to 0.24. An MRA revealed non-obstructive plaque in the common iliacs, 50% left external iliac and question of disease in right internal iliac; 40 to 60% common femoral and 40 to 50% stenosis more distally with 60 to 70% serial left SFA stenoses. He had a totally occluded anterior tibialis bilaterally with 60 to 80% trifurcation area disease and high grade posterior tibial on the right and occluded posterior tibial on the left. \n10/77 he was admitted with angina and ruled out for an MI. A cardiac catheterization revealed 50% focal LM lesion, mid 100% LAD lesion, 60 mid LCX, 50-70 OM2, 40-50 dominant RCA distal lesion with an EF of 65%. He has been treated medically without any further angina. \n. \n11/77 peripheral angiography revealed 40-60% LIIA lesion, 50-80 LSFA stenosis, 40-60 L profunda lesion, totally occluded L AT &amp;amp; L PT, R EIA 60% lesion, RIIA 40-60 proximal &amp;amp; 70-90 mid disease, totally occluded R AT &amp;amp; R PT, 70-80 R peroneal. The LSAF was treated with PTA/Xpert 6 x 60 stent, the R EIA lesion was treated with Palmaz Blue 6 x 24 stent. \n6/78 he was taken for peripheral angiography which revealed 30% REIA ISR, mod-sev bil IIA disease, R SFA 70-75, TO AT/PT and 50-60 peroneal. The proximal R SFA was treated with PTA, mid was tx with DCA/PTA \nSince then he has experienced exertional and rest CP occasionally requiring SL TNG with relief. In addition, he has experienced SOB with stair climbing but denies SOB with chest pain. He also has been experiencing claudication with left leg worse than right which has been preventing him from performing exercise. \n\nA ETT MIBI was done 10/31/78 where he exercised for 3 minutes 53 seconds. He complained of b/l leg claudication and chest pain and actually fell on the treadmill because \" his legs gave out\". Imaging revealed anterior, apical and septal ischemia as well as an EF of 49% and anterior and septal HK. Dr Barton put him on trial of Nitrodur, however, he developed lightheadedness and it was stopped. \nHe was referred for cardiac and peripheral angiography. \nPreliminary Cardiac Cath reports reveals TO LAD with distal LAD filling from RCA collaterals (unchanged from previous cath). Peripheral angiography was performed and cryoplasty was performed to the LSFA for ISR as well as Precise 6x30 stent to LSFA and Cypher 2.5x30 stent to the tibeo-peroneal trunk. He arrived on Cardio. divis. in NAD. \n\n\n\tPast medical history:\n   1. HTN. \n2. Hyperlipidemia . \n3. CAD as above \n4. PAD as above \n5. Type 2 DM (HgbA1c 7.5 last week) \n6.

Yusuf is a 64 y.o. male who presented to Dr Barton's office on 6/18/79  with left foot pain with claudication at approximately 20 feet, L&gt;R, and constant left great toe pain. He has intermittent b/l buttock. Found it difficult to walk from the entrance to the Cath lab today. He describes upon awakening with paresthesias which resolves with ambulation. He does not exercise but is active during the day. \n\nHe also c/o chest discomfort starting last week with palpitations associated with lightheaded. He was resting at the time. He took sl TNG without any improvement. This has occured 2-3 times. He denies sob, n/v, diaphoresis, syncope. \n\nCTA RUN on 6/03/79 showed multilevel disease involving both SFAs. Right focal area of mild to moderate ISR. Left severe focal stenosis of the SFA proximal to the proximal stent and severe focal in-stent stenosis within the distal stent. One vessel runoff bilaterally via the peroneal arteries. AVF in the right groin. \n\nAn Adenosine MIBI was performed on 6/03/79. Exercised with arm exercises for  4' 0\", reaching 62% of MPHR. EKG negative for ischemia. Images show small territory of mild septal ischemia, EF 46%. Compared to 10/78 (done w/ exercise as opposed to adenosine) the anterior and apical ischemia is no longer evident and the EF is similar 49%. \n\nToday he underwent coronary angiography which revealed no change from prior cath. Peripheral angiogram noted aorta and renal arteries were patent. Left and right common and external iliac arteries patent. Stent at the origin of the right ext iliac had a 30% diffuse narrowing. Bilateral internal iliac arteries have moderately severe stenoses in the distal aspect of main branches. The left SFA has two areas of tapered stenosis up to 70% one is proximal and the other is midvessel; main popliteal is patent, but focal 75% stenosis present at distal portion prior to trifurcation. Anterior and posterial tibial vessels occluded and reconstitute at the ankle by collaterals from the peroneal. The peroneal has calcified 60% diffuse disease in the proximal segment. He therefore underwent PTA of the proximal SFA, PTA and stent to the mid SFA, DCA and PTA of distal popliteal lesion, fox hollow and PTA of proximal peroneal stenosis. He is presently being admitted to Cardiology post intervention.\n\n\n\tPast medical history:\n   1. Coronary artery disease. Cath 11/78 showed 3 vessel CAD with involvement of distal coronary circulation. All vessels  narrow in caliber. LM distal 30%, LAD diffuse proximal plaque and occluded after large diagonal. Faint collaterals supply distal LAD and septals,. Diagonal patent, Lcx 50% ostial stenosis  then 50-60% irregular stenosis in proximal aspect of AV groove artery after OM1 take off. OM1 patent. Diffuse plaquing in Lcx and Om. RCA diffuse plaquing in dominant vessel, narrow up to 35%. EF 65% with mild apical HK.\n\n2. PVD: \nStent to right external iliac, 30% narrowing. \nPTA to SFA, stent to mid SFA, directional arthrectomy and PTA of distal popliteal lesion, fox hollow PTA or proximal peroneal stenosis. Angiogram 11/78: \nPeripheral artery disease. Aroto iliac vessels patent. Left Common iliac 40% plaque distally. Left  internal iliac patetn, left external iliac patent, left CFA calcified plaque w/ 40% stenosis. Left SFA 40% focal proximal, then 50-60% mid and 70% stenosis proximal to and into prior. Adductor canal stent, 70% at egress of stent. Left popliteal patent. Peroneal patent but AT and PT occluded. TPT 70% tapered. Right common and external iliacs patent, internal iliac distal stenosis of 60-70% at complex trifurcation. Right CFA narrowed 50% by plaque. Right SFA and popliteal diffuse plaque deposition, patent.

He's a 51 year old male who approximately 2 weeks ago developed \na pain and stiffness in his neck that limits his range of motion.  \nApproximately 5 days ago he developed acute, severe and boring pain at \nthe right trapezius and medial scapular that limits his ability to sleep \nand function.  Toradol, anti-inflammatory muscle relaxants and Percocet \nwere of minimal help.  He had no other constitutional symptoms; fevers, \nrashes.  He had noticed some numbness and tingling down the right 5th \nfinger and the pain would often travel down the outer part of the \ntriceps region to the elbow and down to the right 5th finger.  He notes \ncertain positions will alleviate the pain.  He then presented to a \nchiropractor on Saturday who manipulated his back, obtained x-rays which \nshowed no abnormality.  Sunday, he received another manipulation and on \nSunday night he was abdominal to sleep through the night.  This morning \nhe states he had no pain in his neck, however, in mid-morning he did \nhave recurrent pain.  He presents today for management treatment of his \ndisorder.\n \nALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.\n \nMEDICATIONS:  Flurazepam 20mg. at night.\n \nPAST SURGICAL HISTORY:  History is significant for repair of a right \nfemoral compound fracture approximately 2 years ago and breast reduction \nsurgery.\n \nPAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Significant for pulmonary embolism after his \northopedic surgery.\n \nSOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient works as a pilot for Frontier Airlines.  He is married and has 3 children who are healthy.  He \nsmokes a pipe.\n \nFAMILY HISTORY:  He has one sister who has had a radiculopathy.  Mother \nis alive and well at 86.  Father died of an MI. \n \nBrit Eastman, M.D.\nMay 12, 2084 \nPage 2\n \n \n \nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  On examination, blood pressure is 140/90.  HEENT \nexamination was otherwise normal. Posture is somewhat stooped.  \nExamination of the joints reveal deformity and swelling of the right 3rd \nPIP.  Has normal DIPs, PIPs, MCPs, wrists, elbows and shoulders.  Normal \nhips, knees, ankles and toes.  In the effected arm, he has normal elbow, \nnormal triceps and biceps reflexes.  Normal brachioradialis reflexes.  \nHe has normal sensation in his hand.  He has weakness of the right hand \nintrinsic muscles and palpation in the medial muscle has felt an \nimprovement in the pain. \n \nIMPRESSION:  Mr. Lara, I believe, has an acute radiculopathy of the \na-cervical nerve.  I informed him that this will get better and that it \nwas probably brought on by his antecedent muscle spasm.\n \nPLAN:  We prescribed a neck collar, Indocin 50 TID, Flexeril 10 TID and \nI gave him additional Percocet.  I also prescribed a course of physical \ntherapy with ultrasound and massage.\n \n \nHe will call me in one week and return in roughly 2 weeks.\n \nSincerely yours,\n \n \n \nOlivia Levin, M.D. \n \nKQ:BU:1592\nDD:5-12-84\nDT:5-13-84\n ******** Approved but not reviewed by Attending Provider ********\nRecord date: 2084-12-16\n\nFOREST HOSPITAL PHYSICIAN GROUP\nVincent Y.

In addition, I personally interviewed and\n\nexamined this patient.\n\nHISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 59-year-old male with\n\nhistory of elevated cholesterol who presents for evaluation of\n\nintermittent neck pain and arm discomfort over the course of the\n\nlast several weeks and now with substernal chest pain radiating\n\nto the neck since 6 hours prior to admission.  The patient does\n\nnot have any documented history of CAD.  He has noted over the\n\nlast several weeks episodes of exertional right-sided neck aching\n\nand arm discomfort with arm numbness, which seems to occur with\n\nexertion and resolve with rest.  He has no noted over the last\n\nweek, but on exertion, he has had episodes of bilateral neck\n\naching discomfort with radiating achy into both of the arms.  His\n\nsymptoms generally resolve with rest.  Today, approximately 6\n\nhours prior to presentation, he was driving when he had the onset\n\nof bilateral neck and arm aching pain with substernal chest\n\ndiscomfort, shortness of breath, a sensation of palpitations and\n\nmild sweatiness.  He had no nausea and no vomiting.  His symptoms\n\npersisted over the course of last several hours, and he presented\n\nto the Emergency Department for evaluation.  He denies any prior\n\nhistory of chest pain in the past.\n\nPAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Positive only for elevated cholesterol and\n\nquestionable history of PE in the past.  He did smoke in the past\n\nand drinks occasionally.  He lives with his significant other.\n\nFAMILY HISTORY:  Reviewed and is positive for early CAD in his\n\nfather.\n\nREVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  Other systems are reviewed and otherwise\n\nnegative except per the HPI.\n\nMEDICATIONS:  Only Lipitor.\n\nALLERGIES:  No medical allergies.\n\nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Temperature is 95.2, pulse 96,\n\nrespirations 18, blood pressure 121/65, and the O2 saturation is\n\n94%.  The patient is awake, alert, middle age male who appears\n\nmildly uncomfortable but in no respiratory distress, reclining on\n\nthe stretcher.  Head examination is normocephalic, atraumatic. \n\nHis pupils are equal and reactive to light.  His sclerae are\n\nanicteric.  His conjunctivae are pink and moist.  He has moist\n\nmucous membranes with no erythema.  His neck is supple and\n\nnontender.  The trachea is midline.  There is no adenopathy. \n\nThere is no JVD.  He has full range of motion.  There is no\n\nsubcutaneous emphysema.  His lungs reveal mild tachypnea.  There\n\nis no chest wall tenderness.  There is no accessory muscle use. \n\nHe has bibasilar crackles in both lower lung fields.  There is no\n\nwheezing and equal breath sounds.  His cardiac examination is\n\ntachycardic and regular at about 100 with a 4/6 systolic murmur\n\nheard prominently at the apex as well as at the right second\n\nintercostal space.  There is no rub.  His pulses are normal.  His\n\nabdomen is minimally obese but nondistended, soft, nontender, no\n\nguarding, no peritoneal signs.  There is no organomegaly and no\n\npulsatile masses.  His skin is intact, warm, somewhat moist but\n\nnot diaphoretic.  There are no rashes.  Extremities reveal no\n\ncyanosis, clubbing, or edema.  Calves are soft and nontender with\n\nno palpable cords, full range of motion with normal strength and\n\ntone.  He is oriented x3.  Cranial nerves are intact.  There is\n\nno motor or sensory deficit.\n\nEMERGENCY DEPARTMENT COURSE:  The patient had IV access\n\ninitiated.  He was placed on a cardiac monitor.  EKG was\n\nperformed.  He received 1 time sublingual nitroglycerin with a\n\ndrop in his blood pressure to systolic in the high 70s.  A second\n\nIV was placed.  Right-sided EKG leads were performed, and the\n\npatient received IV fluid bolus.  He had already received\n\naspirin.  His white blood cell count is 8.4, hematocrit 41, and\n\nplatelets 175,000.  His electrolytes are within normal limits. \n\nHis BUN is 18, creatinine 0.9, and glucose 124.  His CK was 93. \n\nHis troponin was less than assay.  His initial EKG showed normal\n\nsinus rhythm in the 80s with a normal axis, normal intervals. \n\nHis pseudonormalization noted only in lead III.  He has\n\napproximately 1.5 mm ST depression with normal ST segments in the\n\nanteroseptal leads with somewhat hyperacute appearing T waves. \n\nRight-sided leads show some mild, less than 1-mm, ST upward\n\nsloping in V2 through V5.  He had a chest x-ray performed that\n\nshowed a normal mediastinum and some mild fluffy alveolar\n\ninfiltrates in the bases but no obvious consolidation and no\n\nsignificant cephalization.  He had blood pressures checked in\n\nboth arms once his blood pressure improved after an IV fluid\n\nbolus and was noted to have a persistent 20 point difference in\n\nsystolic blood pressures of 136/65 on the right and 111/65 on the\n\nleft.  When the patient was questioned about this, he states that\n\nhe has had that noted in his doctor's office in the past.  He\n\nunderwent CT scanning of the chest, which ruled out aortic\n\ndissection after discussion with the attending radiologist.  As\n\nhis blood pressure stabilized, he received IV Lopressor and\n\nbecame pain free.  He did not require any further nitroglycerin. \n\nRepeat EKG was performed showing resolution of the 0.5 mm ST\n\ndepression in the anterior leads.  Given the patient's cardiac\n\nrisk factor and his history, which is fairly worrisome for\n\n ******** Not reviewed by Attending Physician ********\n\nwith a diagnosis of chest pain, rule out new-onset angina.  He\n\ndoes remain pain free now and has maintained a stable blood\n\npressure after IV fluid bolus.

He states that his general health has been stable over the past year but over the past several months he has noted, particularly in the hot weather, a sense of dyspnea after walking about 170 feet to his mailbox, or across a large parking lot, such as Grand Union.  At the end of activity he tends to note a sense of regular fluttering in his chest that persists for a minute or two, and he has also noted the latter almost every night when first lying in bed.  He has not had any recurrent orthostatic symptoms since his Toprol dose was reduced last year.  He has not had any exertionally related chest discomfort or symptoms similar to those prior to his percutaneous interventions.\n\n\n\nMEDICATIONS:\n\n1.  Aspirin 325 mg daily.\n\n2.  Clopidogrel 75 mg daily.\n\n3.  Atorvastatin 40 mg daily.\n\n4.  Lopid 600 mg b.i.d.\n\n5.  Toprol XL 12.5 mg daily.\n\n6.  Xanax, Benadryl at bedtime, multivitamin.\n\n\n\nINTOLERANCE TO MEDICATIONS:\n\n1.  Higher-dose beta blocker - orthostasis.\n\n2.  Lisinopril - questionable contribution to orthostasis.\n\n\n\nOn examination, he is comfortable at rest.  The blood pressure is 170/100 checked twice, supine, standing it is 160/96, heart rate 82 and regular, weight 204 pounds, oxygen saturation 98%.  The jugular venous pressure is 5.  The carotid upstrokes are symmetric and not delayed.  The chest is clear.  Cardiac exam shows a grade II/VI holosystolic murmur localized to the apex.  The abdominal exam shows no organomegaly, pulsatile masses or bruits.  There is no peripheral pitting edema.\n\n\n\nThe electrocardiogram shows sinus rhythm with left atrial abnormality and no new ST-T wave abnormalities compared to October 30, 2093.\n\n\n\nIn summary, Mr. Lara has:\n\n1.  History of CAD, status placement of a drug-eluting stent in the LAD, 7/92, without recurrent angina or signs of left ventricular dysfunction.  Repeat cardiac catheterization, 12/92, because of chest discomfort showed no evidence of restenosis.\n\n2.  Hypertension, not controlled.  His elevated blood pressure may well be contributing to his sense of exertional dyspnea.  We spoke about the options.  As he had developed orthostatic symptoms previously on higher-dose beta blocker and possibly lisinopril, will use smaller doses of alternate agents in an attempt to lower his pressure.  He will add hydrochlorothiazide 25 mg daily plus amlodipine 2.5 mg daily starting today and already has a follow up appointment with you next week.  To investigate potential contributions to the elevated pressure and sense of tachycardia, blood studies today will include electrolytes, plasma metanephrine level and TSH.  A Holter monitor will also be placed in an attempt to determine what he is experiencing with the sense of \"fluttering\" which occurs at least nightly.  Once his blood pressure is controlled, an exercise test will follow.  [Addendum: Holter shows single VPBs/bigeminy at time of his symptoms. Blood studies show normal plasma metanephrines. He reports feeling better with systolic BP in the 120's on September 18, no further palpitations.  He will continue to monitor BP and will call in to schedule ETT]\n\n3.  Dyslipidemia, on combined statin plus gemfibrozil therapy.  When it is time to renew his Lopid, it would be reasonable to switch to TriCor to reduce the potential interaction with statins with respect to myopathy.  A serum CK will be included in today's blood studies.  \n\n4.  Mild mitral regurgitation.\n\n\n\nIt was a pleasure to see Mr. Lara today and I will report back to you following his Holter.  \n\n\n\nWith kind regards, sincerely yours,\n\n\n\n\n\n______________________________\n\nCollin L Cardenas, MD\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\neScription document:1-3282447 MEeScription\n\n\n\nCC: Copy to File\n\n\n\n\n\nDD: 09/07/94\n\nDT: 09/10/94\n\nDV: 09/07/94"}

We started AndroGel therapy for testosterone replacement and appeared that he is taking every day.  He does not really feel any better or stronger with this medication. \n\n\nPAST MEDICAL HISTORY: \n1. Osteoporosis. \n2. Hypogonadism. \n3. History of esophageal cancer status post esophagectomy in 2169, adjuvant chemotherapy and radiation therapy. \n4. Gastroesophageal reflux disease. \n5. Hypertension. \n6. Diabetes type 2. \n7. Carotid artery disease, left. \n8. Hypercholesterolemia. \n9. Status post AAA repair in 2165. \n10. Coronary artery disease with status post stent. \n\n\nREVIEW OF SYSTEMS: He is anxious because he has some swallowing problems and fears that his esophageal disease is acting up and he is anticipating a CAT scan in a few days. \n\n\nMEDICATIONS: Tricor, metoprolol, Prilosec, Lipitor, aspirin, Plavix, Isordil, Zoloft, vitamin C, Centrum Caltrate plus D 600 mg twice a day, zoledronic acid 4 mg IV once a year and AndroGel 5 grams once a day. \n\n\nALLERGIES: Tape. \n\n\nSOCIAL HISTORY: He is married and has 3 children. \n\n\nVital signs: Blood pressure 118/48, pulse 68, weight 136 pounds. Height 5 feet 4 inches. \n\n\nLABORATORY EVALUATION: His testosterone level on AndroGel is normal at 292 mg/dL (normal 195-1138) on 09/13/2171. His hematocrit is 39. It was 37 in 02/2171.. Platelets are 179,000. White count 4.8. \n\n\nIn summary, Mr. Heath is a 76-year-old man with osteoporosis and compression fractures probably secondary to hypogonadism and therapy for esophageal cancer. The cause of hypogonadism is probably the chemotherapy. I asked him again to see a urologist to rule out other causes of primary hypogonadism. \n\n\nHe will continue the current treatment with calcium, vitamin D, testosterone and antiresorptive therapy of his yearly zoledronic acid. \nWe will repeat a BMD in 2 years from now. \n\n\nPlease let me know if you have any questions. \n\n\nYours sincerely, \n\n\n\n\n\n\n___________________________\nVincent Voorhees, M.D.\n\n\n\n\n\n\ncc:\nQuinten Heath, 976 Clinton Street, Gardnerville Ranchos, GA 79269\nDr. Quebedeaux\nDr. Hendricks\n\n\nDD: 09/20/2171\nTD: 09/21/2171 16:37:30\nTR: 8190465\nBackJob ID:  326372\nVoiceJob ID:  91587262\nRecord date: 2173-02-04\n\n\nRADIATION ONCOLOGY FOLLOW-UP NOTE\n\n\nHEATH, QUINTEN M. 805-94-75\n\n\nREFERRING PHYSICIAN: Fred Quebedeaux, M.D.\n\n\nDATE OF VISIT: 2/4/2173\n\n\nREASON FOR VISIT: Reassessment of progress, s/p postoperative adjuvant radiation therapy in combination with concurrent chemotherapy for esophageal adenocarcinoma, T2N1 stage IIB, s/p left thoracoabdominal esophagectomy (12/01/69) with pathologic tumor stage T2N1M0 (3/23 involved lymph nodes).\n\n\nPOSTOPERATIVE RADIATION THERAPY:  For the presence of metastatic disease in regional lymph nodes, he was judged a candidate for postoperative adjuvant chemo-radiation therapy.  He was treated with a total dose of 45 Gy in 25 fractions to the tumor bed region using IMRT, planned with 4D CT simulation.  This treatment was administered in combination with chemotherapy between March 29, 2170, and Apr 30, 2170.  \n\n\nHISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: Mr. Quinten Heath is a 77 year-old gentleman with a history of smoking, chronic GERD, HTN, CAD s/p PCI, partially blocked L carotid artery and AAA repair x 2.  He was in his USOH until 8/69 when he began to have difficulty swallowing.  While eating a hamburger he felt it lodge in his chest with accompanying retrosternal discomfort and increased salivation.  He has had about a dozen similar episodes since then, which have generally resolved within 10-15 minutes without regurgitation.  In 9/69 his PCP prescribed a PPI, which helped somewhat, but he continued to have dysphagia.  On 10/16/69 EGD at Griffin Hospital demonstrated a partially-obstructing distal esophageal mass 34-39 cm from the incisors, associated with Barrett&#8217;s esophagus, with pathology significant for well differentiated invasive adenocarcinoma.  On 10/17/69 CT of the chest and abdomen showed prominent thickening of the distal esophagus.  On 10/21/69 repeat CT of the chest showed an 8 mm LLL nodule and R-sided pleural thickening.  Upper EUS showed a partially obstructing esophageal mass extending from 35-40 cm with 9 mm thickness, suggestive of invasion to the muscularis propria, one suspicious mediastinal LN, and porta hepatis adenopathy.  On 10/22 FNA of a porta hepatis LN was negative.\n\n\nHe underwent a left thoracoabdominal esophagectomy on 12/1/69. Pathology showed an ulcerated tumor measuring 4.0x3.5x0.8 cm, invading into muscularis propria (pT2) and metastasis to 3 of 27 LN (N1).  \n\n\nINTERVAL HISTORY/REVIEW OF SYSTEMS: \nHe has been doing well without significant GI or respiratory symptoms.\nHe has maintained steady energy and appetite.\nHe has had mild dysphagia for solid and meat. Otherwise, he has been doing well.\nHe denies significant respiratory symptoms. No focal or generalized neurological symptoms. The remainder of review of systems was unremarkable.\n\n\nPAST MEDICAL HISTORY:\nGERD x 20 years\nHTN\nHypercholesterolemia\nDM type II\nCAD s/p stent 2164\nPartially blocked L carotid\nAAA repair 2165, 2167\nChronic bronchitis\n\n\nCURRENT MEDICATIONS:\nAspirin (ACETYLSALICYLIC ACID) 325 MG (325MG TABLET Take 1) PO QD \nCaltrate 600 + D (CALCIUM CARBONATE 1500 MG (600 MG ELEM CA)/ VIT D 200 IU) 1 TAB PO BID \nCentrum SILVER (MULTIVITAMINS) 1 TAB PO QD \nIsosorbide 30 MG 1/2 TAB PO bid \nMetformin 250 MG (500MG TABLET Take 0.5) PO QD \nMetoprolol SUCCINATE EXTENDED RELEASE 50 MG (50MG TAB.SR 24H Take 1) PO QD \nPlavix (CLOPIDOGREL) 75 MG (75MG TABLET Take 1) PO QD \nPrilosec (OMEPRAZOLE) 20 MG (20 MG CAPSULE DR Take 1) PO QD \nReclast (ZOLEDRONIC ACID ) 4 MG (4MG/5ML VIAL Take 5 ML) IV once a year , given 6/25/72\nSimvastatin 20 MG (20 MG TABLET Take 1) PO QPM \nTricor (FENOFIBRATE (TRICOR)) 134 MG (134MG CAPSULE Take 1) PO QD \nVitamin C (ASCORBIC ACID) 500 MG PO qd \nZoloft (SERTRALINE) 50 MG (50MG TABLET Take 1) PO QD #30 Tablet(s)\n\n\n\nALLERGIES:\nAdhesive tape (rash)\n\n\nSOCIAL HISTORY:\nLives with wife in Gardnerville Ranchos, GA.  3 healthy adult children.\nRetired 2158 as a Producer for National Radi and Access Amer..\nQuit smoking 2153, prior &#189;-1 ppd x 30 years.\nRare social alcohol.\n\n\nFAMILY HISTORY:\nMother, MI, died age 65.\nFather, died age 89.\nBrother and sister, no cancer.\n\n\nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION:\nGeneral:  pleasant elderly gentleman, NAD\nECOG PS: 1\nVital Signs: \nBP 118/78, P 72, RR 16, Temp 97.3 F, Ht 64.75 in, Wt 137.5 lb\nO2 SAT 97 \nBMI 23.1 \nPAIN LEVEL (0-10) 0 \nHEENT:  PERRL, EOMI, MMM, OP clear\nNeck:  supple, no JVD.\nNodes:  no cervical or supraclavicular LAD\nChest:  Clear without wheezes or rales. \nHeart:  RRR, no m/r/g\nAbdomen:  soft, NT/ND, no HSM, NABS, well-healed scar from AAA repair\nExt:  no edema or tenderness. \nSkin:  Unremarkable. \nNeuro:  AOx3, nonfocal\n\n\nRADIOGRAPHS: Restaging CT of chest, abdomen and pelvis obtained on 1/28/2173 showed no demonstrable recurrence or metastatic disease. \n\n\nIMPRESSION AND PLAN: This 77 year-old man with adenocarcinoma of the distal esophagus, s/p left thoracoabdominal esophagectomy (12/01/69) with pathologic tumor stage T2N1M0 and postoperative adjuvant chemo-radiation therapy has been doing well with no demonstrable recurrence or metastatic disease.

ERNEST EDGE\n\nATTENDING PHYSICIAN: DR. ASHLEI TYSON\n\nOUTPATIENT CARDIOLOGIST: DR. BRIAN MOSS (772-261-4350)\n\n\n\nCHIEF COMPLAINT: fatigue, lightheadedness\n\n\n\nHISTORY OF THE PRESENT ILLNESS\n\nMr. Xayavong is a 61M h/o CAD (anterior STEMI 2077, stents x2 to LAD, 4 stents since then, last 2080), DM, CHF unknown EF, HTN, who p/w ~3 days of nonspecific symptoms of fatigue, nausea, and poor sleep.\n\n\n\nHe receives most of his care at Duluth Clinic-Hermantown (Dr. Moss).  Two weeks ago, he had BiV/ICD placement, as well as left heart catheterization that showed, per verbal report, &#8220;multivessel disease difficult for CABG.&#8221;  He says he also had a chemical stress study but is unsure of the results.  He reports that he was then referred to GNC for high-risk CABG (Dr. U. Wyatt) and potential heart transplant evaluation (Dr. A. Tyson).  \n\n\n\nHe feels that since the BiV/ICD placement he has been feeling more tired, specifically in the past 3 days, wherein he reports fatigue, nausea, poor sleep, exertional lightheadedness.  He has not had chest pain (he did have chest pain with prior two MIs), palpitations, vomiting, diarrhea.  He does have some orthopnea, but no PND and LE swelling intermittently, but not at present.  To his knowledge, he has never had a tachyarrhythmia.  However, he does note that he was started on digoxin a few weeks ago, tried it for 1 week, then had fatigue, nausea, GI upset, and that the medication was then discontinued.\n\n\n\nOn arrival, he had HR 135, BP 106/73 with some drops to low of 80/50.  Felt to be VT versus Afib with aberrancy.  EP was consulted, interrogated his device, and confirmed that he was in Afib (and that it had never fired or detected VT/VF).  He was given amio load 300 and drip at 1mg/min, with some HR response to 100-120s.  For hyperkalemia to 5.1, he was given calcium gluconate, insulin, D50, bicard; and his Mg was repleted.  Given his persistent symptoms, per EP recs, he was started on heparin drip with 5000 units bolus.  (He is not on Coumadin at baseline; he takes toprol XL 12.5mg only.)  CXR by report was clear.  With admiodarone, BPs dropped to 75; upon discontinuation, BPs back up to 80s, then 90s.  Of note, he says his baseline HR is 80s and SBP is 90s.\n\n\n\nREVIEW OF SYSTEMS\n\nNegative in detail except as noted otherwise above.\n\n\n\nPAST MEDICAL/SURGICAL HISTORY: \n\nCAD, h/o STEMI 2077, 8 stents including LAD at least x2, BiV/ICD placement 2 weeks ago, last cath Duluth 2 weeks with &#8220;multivessel disease not amenable to CABG&#8221;\n\nBiV/ICD (DDD, St. Jude Promote RF, 5/13/81)\n\nCHF\n\nDM\n\nHTN\n\nFormer tobacco\n\n\n\nRECENT DIAGNOSTIC STUDIES\n\nTTE, 11/04/2077:\n\nLA dil, LV: WMA anterior, septal, apical, no thrombus, delayed relaxation, EF 35%, RV nl\n\n\n\nInterventional LHC, 10/2077: Successful stenting of the proximal LAD with a\n\n3.5 x 15 and 3.0 x 15 mm Vision stents.\n\n\n\nLHC, 10/2077:\n\nDominance: Right\n\nLeft Main: normal.\n\nLAD: diffuse, irregular, and thrombotic 90 % stenosis in its  proximal third.  \n\nD1: focal 90 % stenosis in its ostium\n\nRamus: focal 95 % stenosis in its  ostium. \n\nBoth the 1st Diagonal and Ramus side branches arise from the thrombotic Proximal LAD segment.\n\nCx/RCA: minimal irregularities\n\n\n\n\nFAMILY HISTORY: Heart disease on both mother&#8217;s and father&#8217;s side, but no early CAD in 1st degree relatives.

He has been followed by Dr. Ashlei Tyson for the possibility of cardiac transplantation and has intermittently been admitted to GNC.  He was admitted to GNC from 6/13/82 to 6/19/82 after being found to be in atrial fibrillation with hypotension, fatigue, and nausea; this was 2 weeks after the placement of his BiV ICD.  He converted to sinus rhythm after amiodarone was administered, but developed a marked transaminitis.  Due to elevated filling pressures (PCWP 23), he required IV Lasix for diuresis.  He was felt to be a poor candidate for CABG given the degree of heart failure, so transplantation was instead pursued.  He was also admitted to GNC from 11/10/82 through 11/13/82 after again being found with elevated filling pressures after complaining of fatigue (PCWP 37); he received a PA line and required a Lasix drip and IV nitroprusside.  At the time of discharge, his reported dry weight was 206 lbs.\n\n\n\nHe came for a scheduled right-sided heart catheterization today as he has had increasing complaint of fatigue.  He reports that he has been feeling &#8220;lousy,&#8221; that his appetite has been &#8220;crummy,&#8221; and that he is &#8220;feeling real tired.&#8221;  He feels that these symptoms have been relatively severe but unchanged for the past 2 years.  He denies overt shortness of breath, but essentially fatigues very easily with physical exertion, and has been requiring multiple naps a day.  He states that he has been careful with his diet (both fluid and salt intake) without any changes, and that he has been entirely compliant with his medications.  Of note, his cardiologist attempted to change him from Toprol XL to Coreg several months ago, and that seems to have made him feel worse.  He continues to urinate to his home Lasix dosing.  He denies any sensation of chest pain or chest pressure, and denies chest palpitations or sensation of fluttering; he states clearly that he could tell when his heart was in an abnormal rhythm in 6/72.  He says that his pacemaker was &#8220;checked&#8221; last week and that he was told he didn&#8217;t have any &#8220;episodes.&#8221;  He believes that he has been putting on weight recently, and reports that his baseline weight is ~225 lbs.  He denies recent fevers or chills.  He has no complaint of leg swelling.\n\n\n\nPAST MEDICAL/SURGICAL HISTORY\n\nCAD\n\n\nSTEMI 2077 s/p 2 stents to the LAD (done at GNC)\n \nReports 2 other MI&#8217;s (2079 and 2080, treated at OCH)\n \nReportedly s/p ~8 stents in total after various interventions\n \nPer report, multi-vessel disease &#8220;difficult for CABG&#8221; 5/82\n\nCHF\n\n\n\nBiV ICD placement DDD 5/13/2082\n \nClass D, Stage III\n\nDiabetes\n\n\nChronic Renal Insufficiency\n\n\n\nh/o Latent Tuberculosis\n\n\n\ns/p Toe Amputation x2\n\n\nLast one was taken off several months ago secondary to infection\n\ns/p Fused L Ankle\n\n\n\nRECENT DIAGNOSTIC STUDIES\n\nCardiac Catheterization (10/30/77)\n\nDominance: Right\n\n\n\nLeft Main: The left main coronary artery is of moderate length, intermediate\n\nsized vessel.

He is a 72-year-old man with CAD S/P diagnostic cath one week ago at SCMHC, found to have a moderately tight lesion in the LAD without significant disease in the left circumflex or RCA.  Because of the recent onset of angina and a stress test showing anterior ischemia, he was brought to ECI, where Dr. Yoseph Flint stented the LAD lesion with a 3.5mm by 32mm Taxus drug-eluting stent, with zero percent residual.  The right femoral arteriotomy was closed with an Angioseal, and there were no complications.  \n\n\n\nHe spent an uneventful evening without complaints, ambulating without difficulty.  His left groin was soft without hematoma or bruit, and extremities were warm and well perfused.  Morning labs included a BUN of 17, creatinine 0.9, hematocrit 37, platelets 236,000, and flat cardiac enzymes.  He was discharged home on Plavix, 75mg po qd for a minimum of six months; enteric-coated aspirin, 325mg po qd; digoxin, 0.25mg po qd; glyburide, 5mg po bid; metoprolol, 50mg po bid; Lipitor, 20mg po qd; Tikosyn, 500mcg po bid; Glucophage, to be resumed at 500mg po bid in two days; and Coumadin, to be resumed tonight.  He has PT/INR check arranged in several days.  He will follow up with you in the next two weeks, and will see his PMD, Dr. Paige, in the near future.

As you know, Mr. Dejesus is a very pleasant 74-year-old gentleman with paroxysmal atrial fibrillation who is on Coumadin.  He has a history of insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus, hypertension and dyslipidemia.  He has known coronary artery disease and underwent stenting of his left anterior descending artery in 05/2155, at which time he had a Taxus drug-eluting stent placed.  He returns now with increasing dyspnea on exertion and had an elective cardiac catheterization performed at the Southwest Colorado Medical on 07/13/2157 that showed focal 90% instent restenosis in the left anterior descending artery with no other focally occlusive disease.  He was transferred to the Erie County Infirmary and on the afternoon of 07/16/2157, Dr. Yoseph Flint was able to dilate and stent the lesion in the left anterior descending artery with placement of a 3.5 x 28 mm Cypher drug-eluting stent.  The procedure was complicated by brief transient no re-flow that resolved immediately to intracoronary nitroglycerin.  The left femoral arteriotomy was closed using an Angio-Seal device.  Mr. Dejesus has spent an uneventful evening on our Cardiovascular Service.  He has had no complaints of chest pain or shortness of breath.  He is ambulating, eating, and voiding without difficulty.\n\nHis heart rate has been in the 70s, blood pressure in the 110s/60.  He is in atrial fibrillation.  His cardiac exam was irregular with no appreciable murmur.  His lungs were clear to auscultation bilaterally.  His left groin is moderately ecchymotic but soft.  There is no hematoma or bruit.  Extremities are warm and well perfused.\n\nHis morning labs revealed a sodium of 138, potassium of 4.9, BUN of 21, creatinine of 1.2.  His total CK is 58 with a CK-MB of 0.4.  His hematocrit is stable at 38, white count of 9, platelets of 300,000.  His fasting lipid panel showed a total cholesterol 123 with an HDL of 25, LDL of 49, and triglycerides of 244.\n\nWe are discharging him home on the following medications:  Plavix 75 mg p.o. daily, which must be continued for a minimum of the next three months, aspirin 325 mg p.o. daily is to be backed off to 81 mg after a few months.  He will resume his Coumadin at 5 mg daily, and have this checked with his primary care physician, Dr. Paige.  He will be on Lipitor 20 mg p.o. daily, digoxin 0.25 mg p.o. daily, Tikosyn 500 mcg p.o. b.i.d., glyburide 5 mg p.o. daily, Avandia 4 mg p.o. daily, Diovan 80 mg p.o. daily, NPH insulin 16 units each evening and sublingual nitroglycerin to be used as needed for chest pain.  We have asked him to arrange a followup appointment with you within the next couple of weeks and to see Robert-Joseph Paige in the near future also.  Thank you very much for allowing us to participate in the care of this pleasant gentleman, and please do not hesitate to contact us with any issues regarding his ongoing management.\n\nWith warmest regards.\n\nSincerely,\n\n\n______________________________\nIrving R.

Dill, M.D.\n\nSouthwest Colorado Medical Health Center\n\n607 Batchelder Street\n\nSuite 975\n\nRobstown, NE  29768\n\n\n\n\n\nDear Dr. Dill:\n\n\n\nDOB:  10/11/2082\n\n\n\nThank you for referring Mr. Dejesus to the Erie County Arrhythmia Service for consideration of catheter ablation of atrial fibrillation.\n\n\n\nAs you know him well, I will summarize his history briefly for our records.  Mr. Dejesus is a 78-year-old gentleman with an extensive cardiac history that includes coronary artery disease status post multiple percutaneous coronary interventions and stents to the LAD as well as RCA territories, a cardiomyopathy with an ejection fraction of approximately 35-40%, and atrial fibrillation.  In addition, he has multiple cardiac risk factors including diabetes, hypertension, dyslipidemia, and obstructive sleep apnea.  In addition to disease in his coronary vascular bed, he has a history of carotid disease status post left CEA.\n\n\n\nHe came to your attention early this year with symptoms of exertional dyspnea.  On further questioning, he reports feeling quite symptomatic when ambulating relatively short distances around his home or up and down the driveway.  He can walk no further than approximately 50-100 feet before developing significant shortness of breath and fatigue.  He was recently diagnosed as having paroxysmal atrial fibrillation that has transitioned to persistent.  He has undergone multiple cardioversions most recently in 03/19/2161, but was unsuccessful.  Prior to that, cardioversion in February resulted in a brief period of restoration of sinus rhythm during which time he felt symptomatically improved.  He also describes occasional fleeting episodes of sharp left-sided chest discomfort.  Cardiac catheterization on 01/18/2161 revealed a 30% LAD in-stent restenosis, 90% septal lesion, and 65% -70% PDA lesion that was stented.  A Ventriculogram at that time revealed an EF of 35-40%.\n\n\n\nOther than significant exertional shortness of breath, he feels relatively well.  He has occasional symptoms of orthostatic lightheadedness but no history of syncope.  He denies any PND, orthopnea, or lower extremity swelling.  He has no history of heart failure hospitalizations.  His weight has been stable.\n\n\n\nOn review of systems, he denies any fevers, chills, or night sweats.  His weight has remained stable.  He denies any new onset cough, wheezing, or hemoptysis.\n\n\n\nPast Medical History:\n\n1.  CAD status post LAD PCI/stenting in 2155.  He developed in-stent restenosis in 07/2157, during which time he received a second drug-eluting stent to the LAD lesion.  He developed recurrent chest discomfort in 12/2159, and he underwent cardiac catheterization during which time he was found to have an 80% mid LAD lesion distal to his prior stents as well as a 30% proximal RCA mid PDA stenosis.  He underwent a drug-eluting stent to the mid LAD lesion.  A followup catheterization in 01/2161 revealed a 30% LAD stenosis, 90% large septal branch lesion, and a 65-70% proximal PDA stenosis.  Ventriculogram revealed an EF of 35-40%.  He underwent stenting to the PDA lesion on 03/06/2161.  An exercise Myoview performed in 01/2160 revealed no evidence of inducible ischemia.\n\n2.  Hypertension.\n\n3.  Dyslipidemia.\n\n4.  Diabetes.\n\n5.  Obstructive sleep apnea.\n\n6.  COPD, prescribed home oxygen, though he is not taking this.\n\n7.  Carotid disease, status post left CEA after presenting with an ipsilateral episode of amaurosis fugax.\n\n8.? History of BLANK AAA by ultrasound in 07/2159.\n\n9.  Atrial fibrillation.\n\n10.  Obesity.\n\n\n\nHe has no known drug allergies.\n\n\n\nHis current medications include amiodarone 200 mg BLANK, but this has been discontinued since April, metoprolol 50 mg b.i.d., digoxin 0.25 mg daily, Zocor 20 mg daily, Plavix 75 mg daily, TriCor 145 mg daily, Lasix 20 mg daily, BLANK 5 mg nightly, aspirin 325 mg daily, Lantus insulin 62 units daily, Humalog insulin, and Protonix 40 mg daily.\n\n\n\nHis social history is notable for remote history of tobacco dependence.  He was formally employed in buidling construction.  He has multiple environmental exposures including insulation as well as spray paint and without respiratory protection.  He does not currently smoke or drink alcohol.\n\n\n\nHis family history is negative for early onset CAD, sudden cardiac death, or cardiomyopathy.  His father lived until the age of 88.  His mother died of a stroke at the age of 80.  He has a single sister who is 86 years of age and has no history of heart troubles.\n\n\n\nPhysical Examination:  His blood pressure is 115/60 BLANK of 66 beats per minute.  In general, he is overweight elderly man in no distress.  Sitting upright his jugular venous pressure is below the clavicles.  Carotid upstrokes are brisk bilaterally.  Lungs are notable for a few crackles at the bases, but otherwise clear.  There is no wheezing.  Cardiac exam reveals an irregular rate with a variable S1 and S2.  There is no audible murmur, rub or gallop.  Abdomen is obese, soft, and nontender.  Lower extremities are warm and well perfused.  There is trace pitting edema at the ankles.\n\n\n\nRecent blood work reveals an INR of 2.2 on 05/28/2161.\n\n\n\nEKG today reveals atrial fibrillation at a rate of approximately 66 beats per minute.  There are some nonspecific T-wave abnormalities, but otherwise no evidence of prior infarct or ST changes.  There is some low voltage in the limb leads, though I suspect this is related to his habitus.\n\n\n\nOverall, Mr. Dejesus is a pleasant 78-year-old man with a complex prior medical history who appears to have persistent atrial fibrillation with a principal functional limitation of exertional shortness of breath.  He appears to be functional class III.  He does not have any frank evidence of volume overload on exam today, though his ventricular function and is not entirely normal.  Moreover, he has multiple comorbidities which may exacerbate his exertional dyspnea including COPD and coronary artery disease.\n\n\n\nWe discussed atrial fibrillation with Mr. Dejesus and his family today.  We explained that the brief period of normal sinus rhythm associated with symptomatic improvement may be a reason to proceed with catheter ablation.  However, given his comorbidities and the presence of persistent arrhythmia we warned that a single catheter ablation procedure may not be entirely successful and that waiting period of approximately 3-4 month post-ablation may be required to adjudicate success.  Given the length of the procedure as well as his comorbidities, we feel reasonable to consult with our anesthesia colleagues for possible consideration of performing the procedure under general anesthesia versus with MAC and had procedural sedation.  We will leave this decision to them.  Moreover, prior to the ablation, we will request a transesophageal echocardiogram to rule out left atrial clot prior to ablation.\n\n\n\nThank you very much for referring Mr. Dejesus to our care.  We will be in touch following the procedure.  As always, feel free to call with any questions.\n\n\n\nSincerely,\n\n\n\n\n\n______________________________\n\nOscar U Rice, M.D.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\neScription document:0-16320445 HFFocus\n\n\n\nCC: Robert-Joseph Paige M.D.\n\nKoenen Collins County Clinic\n\n266 Paxton Terrace\n\nPeculiar, NE, 54583\n\nFax: \n\nEmail: \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDD: 06/03/61\n\nDT: 06/04/61\n\nDV: 06/03/61"}

[02-Jun-2087]\n\n\n\nRecheck BUN and creatinine today.\n\nperipheral vascular disease\t      \n\nHe has bilateral femoral bruits and diminished peripheral pulses, but because of his limited walking ability, currently has no symptoms of claudication.\n\nRECTAL FISTULA\t      \n\nSINCE LAST VISIT HE WAS SEEN BY DR. JENSON AND UNDERWENT A FLEXIBLE. SIG. HE HAD A SINUS OPENING IN THE LEFT POSTERIOR PERIANAL AREA. HE FELT THAT TO FULLY EVALUATE THIS TO SEE WHETHER IT WAS AN ANAL FISTULA OR A PILONIDAL CYST THAT EXAM UNDER ANESTHESIA WITH UNROOFING OF THE LESION WAS INDICATED.  PT SO FAR HAS DECLINED THIS, BUT WILL LET DR. JENSON KNOW IF HE RECONSIDERS.  CURRENTLY HE IS WILLING TO LIVE WITH HIS SYMPTOMS.\n\nOSTEOARTHRITIS\t      \n\nHe has had recent significant worsening in his L knee pain.  It has now gotten to the point where it limits his ability to walk, so that he can only \"limp less than a block\" and has difficulty with stairs.  Given that he has done well from a cardiac standpoint since his admissions in the spring, he is interested in pursuing a L TKR replacement if Cardiology feels it would be feasible.  Will refer him to Dr. Robles for initial evaluation.\n\nCarotid stenosis\t      \n\nAccording to Dr. Cook's records, a carotid artery duplex scan from 5/06 showed 60 to 80% stenosis of the RICA, but I do not find those records of PCIS.  Apparently he is scheduled for a repeat study before he follows up with Dr. Cook.  He is S/P R cerebellar CVA back in '80 and has had stable minor neurologic deficits since that time and currently denies any new neurologic symptoms.\n\n\n\nReview of Systems\t\n\nSmall lesion on his R ear.  Recent R groin infection which required treatment with antiobiotics by Dr. Valentine in 5/06.  Nocturia X1.  Denies symptoms of hypoglycemia.  No neurologic symptoms.  Denies palpitations, SOB, chest pain, lightheadedness or syncope.  Denies peripheral edema.  No abdominal pain or change in his bowels.  He does have chronic rectal fistula and continues to have intermittent hematochezia and discharge, but he is able to self-treat this and declines surgery.  No melena.\n\n\n\nVital Signs\t  \n\nWeight:\t 188   Pounds\n\nBlood Pressure:\t 140/60   \n\nPulse:\t 64   Regular\n\n\n\nPhysical Exam\t  \n\n \n\nGeneral Appearance\t\n\nWell appearing.\n\nSkin\t\n\nExtensive sun damage, with several actinic-appearing lesions over scalp, forehead and pinna.

Wife very helpful in cooking appropriate\nmeals and helping with day to day issues.  \n\nONGOING MANAGEMENT/MULTIPLE MEDICAL PROBLEMS:\n    1.    Health maintenance.  Eye exam. Continue to recommend annual\n    exams with Dr. Ortiz.  Influenza vaccine advised, Winter 89.\n    PSA sent.  \n    2.    Preventative counseling.  Continues to swim in a pool, no\n    alcohol, no cigarettes.  Advised regular skin checks.\n    Avoidance of sun.  Rectal exam neg.  Smoking status: none\n    smoker.  Stool guaiac test: home with stool guaiac cards.  \n\nPROBLEMS:\n    1.    CAD.  He continues to do quite well with no evidence of\n    current symptoms of angina.  He is s/p CABG and most\n    recently s/p stent distal LCX 10/87.  \n    2.    CHF.  He has severe ischemic cardiomyopathy with chronic\n    CHF.  His most recent echocardiogram 4/88, showed a severe\n    depressed LV systolic function with estimated EF of 30% with\n    global hypokinesis and antero-apical akinesis with moderate\n    LV enlargement and mild concentric LVH with left atrial\n    enlargement, dilated aortic root, mild AI and trace MR. \n    despite this, since getting on a stable dose of Lasix and\n    Carvedilol, which was added during his hospitalization for\n    CHF in 10/87, he has done well and currently denies symptoms\n    of orthopnea, PND or edema.  \n    3.    S/P AICD.  He is s/p recent admission to MCH, 6/17 through\n    6/19/89 for replacement of his cardiac defibrillator.  He\n    did well without complication and he continues to follow up\n    Dr. Cook on a regular basis.  He has had no VT, VF, which\n    has been symptomatic or which has caused triggering of his\n    AICD.  \n    4.    S/P DDD pacemaker for sick sinus syndrome, 7/83.  Continues\n    to do well, again, with close monitoring by Dr. Cook. \n    5.    Hypertension.  Blood pressure is excellent on current\n    regimen and will continue same.  \n\nGeorge, Rickey\nMR #113-14-14                 -2-            June 27, 2089\n\n    6.    Diabetes mellitus.  He continues on oral agents, watching\n    his diet and exercising as much as he is able.  He does not\n    monitor sugars often but he reports when he does have them\n    done, sugars are typically fasting 100-150 and no symptoms\n    of hypoglycemia.  Will check HBA1C and urine for micro\n    albumin today.  \n    7.    Cerebral vascular disease.  He is s/p cerebellar CVA, 7/80\n    with mild residual dysarthria and right sided weakness but\n    has had no new neurologic events. His most recent carotid\n    artery duplex study was from 5/88, showed a 60-80% stenosis\n    of the RICA but I don't actually hear a bruit on his exam\n    today.  He continues on Coumadin anticoagulation.  \n    8.    Hypercholesterolemia.  His most recent lipid profile is\n    quite improved with Lipitor with a total cholesterol down to\n    136, triglycerides 313, HDL 25, LDL 48 on 6/11/89.\n    Unfortunately, since his HDL remains low, which is\n    suboptimal, but he has not tolerated Niacin in the past. \n    9.    Peripheral vascular disease. He continues to have bilateral\n    femoral bruits and diminished peripheral pulses but because\n    of his limited walking ability, he currently has no symptoms\n    of claudication. \n    10.   Osteoarthritis. He is s/p left TKR by Dr. Robles last year\n    and is now doing quite well.  Notably, he would require\n    antibiotic prophylaxis for procedures.  \n\nREVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  He denies chest pain, shortness of breath,\nabdominal pain. He continues to have a rectal fistula.  Last\nyear, had a negative Barium enema study and several years ago a\nsigmoidoscopy because of guaiac positive stool but this is\npresumably secondary to the rectal fistula, which intermittently\nbleeds.  He has had no recent edema in his legs. His left knee is\ndoing quite well and he is working to strengthen the thigh\nmuscles. He has nocturia one time per night. He has stable\nimpotence, some decreased interest as well as some decreased\nability to have erections, though he can still have a partial\nerection. Generalized decreased energy level.  \n\nPHYSICAL EXAM:  Blood pressure:  136/60, pulse: 60 and regular. \nWeight: 181. General: amazingly well appearing.  Skin: no\nsuspicious lesions.  HEENT: oropharynx edentulous, no lesions. \nLungs: clear to A&P.  COR:  carotids 2+, no bruits appreciated by\nmy exam.  JVP flat. Thyroid: no thyromegaly. Nodes: no\nadenopathy.

Status post AICD.  Continues to\nfollow up with Dr. Cook on a regular basis.  AICD has not\ntriggered.  \n\n3.   Status post DDD pacer for sic sinus syndrome.  He has\nfrequent ectopics versus ? AF by exam today.  Will check EKG and\nrhythm strip. \n\n4.   CHF/CMCAD.  He had an episode of shortness of breath leading\nto hospitalization this spring down in West Virginia.  Unfortunately, I\ndo not have records but there was some question of whether this\nwas related to asthma, allergies or CHF.  He has had two pillow\northopnea and worsening edema than in the past.  He has also\nnoted some more exertional dyspnea.  He denies cough, wheeze,\nhemoptysis.  ? PND. \n\n     Most recent echo 4/88, severely depressed LV with EF about\n30%.  Mild concentric LVH.  Dilated aortic route.  Mild AI. \nTrace MR.  He is currently on a regimen of Imdur, Lasix,\nCarvedilol, Zestril and Digoxin.\n\n     Will plan increase Lasix to 80 q.d. Check chest x-ray, PFTs\nand reassess.  \nGeorge, Rickey\nMR#: 1131414\nJuly 7, 2090 \nPage 2\n\n5.   Diabetes mellitus.  Continues on oral agents and has been\nquite good with his diet.  Weight is actually down 10 pounds\nwhich he attributes to excellent attention to diet.  Will recheck\nFBS, HB A1c today.  He continues to receive routine dental and\npodiatry care.  \n\n6.   Status post cerebellar CVA.  Mild residual dysarthria and\nright sided weakness.  No new neurologic events.  Most recent\ncarotid study 5/88, 60-80% stenosis right internal carotid.  He\ncontinues on Coumadin.\n\n7.   Hyperlipidemia.  Continues on Lipitor with improved lipid\nprofile though HDL remains low.  He has not tolerated Niacin in\nthe past.  Will recheck fasting lipids today.\n\n8.   Peripheral vascular disease.  Continues to have bilateral\nfemoral bruits but no complaints of claudication.  \n\n9.   Osteoarthritis/left knee pain.  He is status post left TKR\nby Dr. Robles last year.  Unfortunately had a knee injury down in\nWest Virginia this spring and has quite a bit of problem with swelling\nand pain.  He was seen by Dr. Robles who treated him briefly with\nVioxx but this caused significant worsening lower extremity edema\nand decreased urine output requiring its discontinuation.  He is\nnow carefully using ibuprofen and has follow up scheduled with\nDr. Robles.\n\n10.  Nephropathy.  Status post renal biopsy 10/79 for severe\nproteinuria.  Biopsy consistent with diabetic nephropathy. \nContinues on ACE inhibitor.  Will recheck BUN, creatinine today.\n\nReview of systems: As per HPI, no abdominal pain, nausea,\nvomiting, melena, hematochezia, hematuria.

Status post removal of infected AICD and pacer.  Admitted to Massillon Community 12/91 with infection of his AICD and permanent pacer.  He was managed by multiple\nservices including EP, Cardiology, and ID.  His OR cultures grew candida and he was treated\nwith a prolonged course of fluconazole.  Although he had runs of NSVT, he was managed\neffectively with carvedilol.  Notably his digoxin was stopped because of bradycardia during the\nhospitalization. He never had any sustained VT or VF.  He was subsequently discharged home\nwith a Life vest defibrillator.\n\nHe has done well with no recurrent evidence of infection.  He currently has no AICD or\npacemaker but saw Dr. Cook yesterday and apparently he is being evaluated for new hardware\nfor his arrhythmia issues.  He has a history of both VF arrest and sick sinus syndrome.  Currently\nhis heart rate is slightly irregular but a reasonable rate and he will continue on his current\nregimen as prescribed by Dr. Cook with close follow up.  \n\n2.   CHF.  Immediately after his discharge from CCGH after his hospitalization, he went\ndirectly to West Virginia where his wife was able to care for him. He had one episode of CHF, which\nwas managed as an outpatient, and he is now on slightly doses of Lasix than previously.  At the\npresent time, he has no active symptoms of CHF, he continues to sleep on two large pillows at\nnight without symptoms of orthopnea and has minimal to no peripheral edema.  He does\ncontinue on an ACE inhibitor and potassium along with his Lasix. \n\n3.   Coronary artery disease.  Despite all of his active issues, he has no current symptoms of\nangina and has tolerated his multiple recent procedures well.\n\n4.   Status post infected (staph) left knee arthroplasty.  His left TKR also required removal\ndue to infection and he had replacement of new hardware by Dr. Judd 10/91.  He has had no\nrecurrent infection, but his rehabilitation has been more limited because of his other medical\nissues.  He does report that he was swimming in the pool and doing things on his own while\ndown in West Virginia, but we will make a formal rehab referral now that he is back in the Mexico area.\n\n5.   Diabetes mellitus.  Throughout his numerous medical problems over the past six to\ntwelve months, he has had a significant weight loss and not surprisingly, his diabetes regimen\nhas been gradually decreased.  He is now on Glyburide 5 mg b.i.d. and he reports that his fasting\nsugars which he is checking about three times a week are running quite good in the 100 to 120\nrange.  He has no complaints of hypoglycemia or blood sugars greater than 200.  We will check\nhis HbA1c today and continue his current regimen.\nGeorge, Rickey\nMRN: 1131414\n06/10/92\nPage 2\n\n6.   Hyperlipidemia.  He continues on Lipitor.  We'll recheck his fasting lipids, LFTs and\nCPK.\n\n7.   Diabetic nephropathy.  He remains on ACE inhibitor and will check renal function today\nto re-establish baseline.\n\n8.   Status post CVA.  Known moderate right carotid stenosis.  Minimal residual dysarthria\nand right-sided weakness. Has had no recent neurologic symptoms and remains on Coumadin.\n\nPHYSICAL EXAM:  Blood pressure by palpation 130.  Was unable to get sufficient blood\npressure by cuff.  Pulse 60, mostly irregular. General, thin, but no distress.  Lungs, clear to\nauscultation and percussion.  Cor, distant heart sounds.  No S3 appreciated. Old pacer/AICD site. \nNo evidence of erythema or fluctuance.  Extremities, trace edema bilaterally.\n\nDISPOSITION:  Close ongoing follow up.\n\nADDENDUM:  In reviewing patient's medical records after he left today, I found mention of\nboth hematuria and guaiac positive stool during his recent hospitalizations.  At this time, he was\nquite debilitated and I do not think it would be a good time for colonoscopy.  He did deny\nabdominal symptoms as part of my review of systems today.  \n\nAt this point, my plan will be to send him some stool guaiac cards which he can do at home and\nsend in to me by mail.  I have also sent off a CBC today.  I will plan to repeat urinalysis at his\nnext visit.  If he has persistent hematuria or guaiac positive stool, then we will need to discuss\nmore aggressive work-up, but given his overall health condition, I do not feel the need to be\naggressive at this time and would like to see him get some strength back first. \n\n\n\n____________________________________\nOpal C. Fierro, M.D.\nDictated/Not read\nkurtz\n\ncc:\nKeith Cook, M.D.\nMassillon Community Hospital\n22 Monterey Avenue, Cardiology Service\nMexico, CT 33383-9795\nRecord date: 2092-10-05\n\n\n  \n                      OFFICE NOTE\n  Rickey George\n  MR#1131414\n  October 05, 2092\n  \n  Reason for visit: scheduled follow up status post MCH hospitalization.  \n  \n  PROBLEMS:\n  \n  PVD: since last visit he was admitted to MCH with gangrene in his left second toe. \n  Admitted MCH 8/29 through 9/9/92.  Treated by Dr. Randall.  Underwent extensive\n  revascularization including right common and external artery transluminal balloon\n  angioplasty and stenting, bilateral common and profunda femoral artery\n  endarterectomies, right and left femoral to femoral bypass graft, left femoral to above\n  knee popliteal bypass graft.  With this surgery, only his left second toe remained\n  gangrenous and he was able to avoid BKA.  \n  \n  He will likely either auto-amputate or will require amputation of his left second toe\n  which remains gangrenous but he has reasonable perfusion to the remainder of his left\n  foot and has follow up scheduled next week with Dr. Randall.  \n  \n  Renal insufficiency: during his hospitalization he bumped his creatinine quite a bit but\n  this appeared to be due to acute interstitial nephritis caused by Unasyn (positive urine\n  EO's), reached a high of 3.9 on 9/02 but was down to 1.4 which is baseline at the time of\n  hospital discharge 9/9.  Will recheck renal function today.  \n  \n  Diabetes mellitus: his appetite has been poor and he had blood sugars, which were low on\n  oral agents, and these have been discontinued.  His blood sugars are now in the normal\n  range on no oral agents or insulin.  Will need to monitor closely through rehab.  \n  \n  CHF: he had been on 80 b.i.d. of Lasix prior to his hospitalization.  At the time of\n  hospital discharge his dose was down to 40 b.i.d. and not surprisingly he developed quite\n  a bit of recurrent peripheral edema.  He called the office and I increased his Lasix back\n  up to 60 b.i.d. but he still has significant edema.  Will go back to 80 b.i.d. with close\n  monitoring.  \n  \n  Hypertension: with diuresis and weight loss, his BP is running low.  Will hold lisinopril\n  for now.  Close VNA follow up.  \n  \n  COPD: doing well despite recent surgery.  Continues to use Combivent inhaler p.r.n.  \n  \n  Anemia: Crit was in the 20's during his hospitalization in the setting of acute renal failure\n  and surgery with blood loss.  His Crit at the time of discharge was approximately 28.7\n  and he was being started on Epogen.  Unfortunately because of insurance issues, he has\n  not actually been able to yet obtain it but the plan is for him to get 2,000 units 3 times a\n  \n  \n  Rickey George\n  MR#1131414\n  October 05, 2092\n  Page 2\n  \n  week.  For now, he is on vitamins and iron supplements as his bowels tolerate.  Given his\n  history of CAD, goal is to keep his hematocrit between 30-32.  \n  \n  Coronary artery disease: despite his recent surgical stress and anemia, he has had no\n  anginal symptoms.  \n  \n  Review of systems: constipation related to the iron.  Generally weak.  Home services\n  now include VNA, home health aide, PTOT, walking with a walker, biggest issue is\n  mostly depression in the setting of his failing health.  \n  \n  Social history: wife very involved with his care.  \n  \n  Physical exam: BP 98/60.  Pulse 64.  Lungs clear to A & P.  Cor: SEMACIAN gallop. \n  No rub.  Abdomen: mildly distended, nontender.  Multiple well healed surgical scars. \n  Extremities: incisions in the groin.  No erythema.  Right groin several cm question cystic\n  structure beneath the incision.  Soft, nontender, non-erythematous.  2-3+ edema in the\n  extremities bilaterally.  Dry gangrene left second toe.  \n  \n  Disposition: 1. Increase Lasix to 80 b.i.d. phone follow up within several days.  \n  2. Temporarily hold lisinopril given low BP.  \n  3. Continue Percocet for toe pain.  \n  4. Follow up with Dr. Randall who needs to assess the cystic mass in his right groin.  \n  5. Will continue to work with insurance to try to obtain Epogen.  In the meantime, will\n  transfuse if Crit drops below 28.  \n  6. Add Lexapro 10mg 1 p.o. q.d. \n  \n  Addendum: long discussion with the patient and his wife (his healthcare proxy) today\n  about end of life issues.  Specifically he states he would never consider any amputation\n  other than his single toe at this point.  He would specifically \"rather die\" than undergo a\n  BKA.

Shelton, MD\nRecord date: 2135-12-15\n\n\n\tCARDIOLOGY\n\t\n\n\tPERDUE MEDICAL CENTER\n\t\n\n\n\tReason for visit:\n   Follow up visit visit\n\n\n\tInterval History:\n   60 year old man with Coronary artery disease who presented in November 2134 with substernal chest pressure and evidence of inferior ST-segment elevation.  Known risk factors at that time (in addition to his age and gender) were Hypertension and tobacco smoking.  Details of that presentation as per my 12/16/34 office note.\n\nEmergent catheterization showed three areas of severe stenosis in the RCA territory, one in the ditsal RCA and two in the PLV.  The PLV lesions each received 2.5 x15mm Minivision (bare metal stents) and the distal RCA lesion received a 3.5 x15mm Vision (bare metal stent).  A non-dominant Left Circumflex had a 70% stenosis that was not intervened upon.  There was non-obstructive disease in the LAD.\n\nA transthoracic echo showed an LV EF of 54% and no wall motion abnormalities.  Left atrium was slightly dilated to 39mm.  RV function was normal.\n\nHe recovered well and was discharged on an appropriate medical program (see below).  He had an outpatient ETT-MIBI to further evaluate the significance of the residual LCx disease.  He had this on 12/07/34 and he exercised for 6 minutes, 7 METS and achieved a heart rate 70% of predicted. He did not experience chest pain, had an appropriate increase in systolic blood pressure and the study was terminated due to leg fatigue.  The images showed inferior and apical thinning without ischemia.  LV EF 63%.\n\nHe had a recurrent episode of chest pain (somewhat different than his MI as it was not pressure like) and presented to the ED in March.  His ECG was stable and biomarkers were negative and he had a repeat ETT-MIBI in which he exercised for 7 mins 10 sec, achieving 9 METS, 80% MPHR, peak double product 19K.  A different type of chest pain occurrred during the study and was not study-limiting.  The ECG was negative for ischemia and the perfusion images were normal, without evidence of ischemia or infarction.  LV EF 68%.\n\nHe has overall done well since the time of his STEMI.  He completed part of the program at cardiac rehab.  He quit cigarette smoking at the time of the MI, and has remained abstinent since then.  He resumed normal activities without limiting symptoms in terms of chest pain or shortness of breath. His overall activity is at times limited due to ankylosing spondylitis and associated pain.\n\nThree days ago he reports the onset of chest pain.  This occurs in his left chest and lasts hours at a time.  Not related to exertion and he has not tried SL TNG.  He states that he has been carrying heavy holiday packages and did some light outdoor work, and wonders if the pain may have been caused by those activities (i.e. muscolskeletal in nature).  He has 2 flights of stairs at home and is able to climb them with minimal shortness of breath, which has not changed since the onset of the CP.  He is unsure how the character relates to that of his previous MI, and he thinks it is similar to the discomfort he had in March that prompted his ED visit and negative stress test.  He denies lightheadedness or syncope.  No orthopnea or lower extremity swelling.\n\nHe continues to be compliant with his medical regimen.  He had a past sleep study which indicates the presence of sleep disordered breathing and he states he is in the process of acquiring home CPAP therapy.  He does report weight gain since stopping cigarettes.\n\n\n\tPast medical history:\n   1) CAD status post inferior STEMI 11/34 with 3 bare metal stents to RCA territory (1 in distal RCA and two in the PLV).  Known residual LCx 70% lesion in a small, non-dominant vessel\n2) Hypertension\n3) Hyperlipideimia\n4) Former smoker - quit at the time of his MI\n5) Ankylosing spondylitis\n6) Thrombophlebitis of the left leg, report of DVT in other notes\n\n\t\n\n\tChanges to Allergies\n\t\nNKA: No Known Allergies - reaction: [reviewed]\n\n\n\tMedications (Confirmed):\n\n\t\nASA \nLipitor  20mg po daily\nlisinopril  10 mg po daily\nNiaspan \nPlavix  75mg po daily\nToprol XL  25 mg PO daily\n\nPhysical examination:\n\t\n-Pulse: 50  regular\n-weight: 268  lbs.\n-General:   Looks well, overweight, pleasant \n-HEENT:   Jugular venous pressure 7cm, carotids 2+ bilaterally without bruits\n-Chest:   CTAB\n-Cardiac:   Point of maximal impulse is midclavicular; Distant, regular, S1 and S2, no murmurs or rubs\n-Abdomen:   Soft, obese, non-tender\n-Extremities:   No lower extremity edema, 2+ posterior tibial pulses bilaterally\n-BP: 130/75  both arms\n\n\n\tEKG:\n   Baseline artifact, Sinus bradycardia at 50 bpm, clockwise rotation, minor nonspecific T wave changes; compared to 16-June-2135, the heart rate is slightly decreased, otherwise no important change.\n\n\n\tAssessment and plan:\n   60 year old man with CAD status post inferior STEMI 11/34 treated with 3 bare metal stents to the RCA territory, Hypertension, Hyperlipidemia, and Ankylosing spondylitis who is overall doing well with secondary prevention efforts for his coronary disease, although he does report a chest pain syndrome for the past several days.\n\n1) Coronary artery disease: Bare metal stents only are in place in the RCA territory, and he has now completed over a 12 month course of Plavix therapy.  Given that the main treatment plan at this time for his ankylosing spondylitis is NSAIDs (i.e. Motrin), he will stop Plavix to help minimize the bleeding risk and since there is no absolute indication for him to continue it at this point. \n\nHe will continue the medical regimen of ASA 81mg daily, Lipitor 20mg daily, Toprol XL 25mg daily and Lisinopril 10mg daily.  His heart rate and blood pressure are well controlled.\n\nThe chest pain syndrome that he has been having for the past several days is reassuring in the sense that it is not exertion related and it seems similar to March when he had an ETT-MIBI without ischemia on perfusion images.  He does have a known 70% stenosis in a non-dominant LCx, but two imaging studies have not shown ischemia in that territory.  His ECG today is unchanged from priors.  However, given his history we will be vigilant for any change or persistence in symptoms.  I will call the patient in several days time, and if he continues to have symptoms he can have a repeat ETT.\n\n2) Secondary prevention: Most recent Lipid panel in 10/35 on Lipitor 20mg daily shows TC 126, LDL 62, HDL 25 and TGs 195.  His LDL has been well controlled however his HDL has been very low on several readings.  Given this, along with an elevated TG value, we will start Niaspan.  He can start with 500 mg qhs for the first 2-3 weeks to help get through the common adverse effects (i.e. flushing).  He should take the medication with a glass of cold water and may take his daily aspirin 30 minutes before to help minimize side effects.  After a few weeks, he can increase to the maintenance dose of 1000 mg qhs.\n\nHe has quit smoking completely since the time of the MI and plans to continue this forward. He was encouraged to increase his physical activity level.\n\n3) Hypertension: Reasonably well controlled on Toprol XL 25mg daily and Lisinopril 10mg daily.  He will be starting CPAP for sleep apnea soon which may have a favorable effect on his blood pressure.\n\nChanges to Medications this visit\n\t\nNiaspan 500mg SR  po at bedtime 2 tablets each night QTY:90 Refills:2 Start: 12/15/2135\nPlavix 75mg  po daily Start: 12/16/2134 End: 12/19/2135 - Inactivated\nASA 81mg  po daily Start: 12/16/2134\n\nDisposition:\nReturn in 4-6 months or PRN\n\n\t\nJan Ivory, MD\n\n\t\ncc: ADDENDUM: I spoke with the patient on 12/21 and his chest discomfort symptoms have resolved and he is feeling well in his usual activities.

He has occasional fleeting chest pain but never sustained and nothing in the past 1-2 months.\n\nHe awoke this AM with dull left chest pain which has persisted throughout the day.  Pain was 6/10 at worst, unchanged with exertion and similar in quality (albeit less intense) to pain during STEMI.  No associated SOB, nausea, diaphoresis or radiation.  Given the CP persistance, he presented to the ER.  Initial ECGs showed sinus brady with a relatively normal tracing; no acute ischemic changes and no significant change from prior.  After a combination of 4 SL nitro, IV nitro, IV heparin and morphine (2mg IV x 2), the CP eventually subsided.  \n\nCurrently, he is CP free and resting comfortably.  At baseline, he doesn't exercise formally but he has 3 flights of stairs at home and he's able to climb them without exertional symptoms.  Also, he was previously on therapy for GERD but stopped taking prilosec several months ago.    \n\n\n\tPast medical history:\n   - CAD - as above\n- HTN\n- hyperlipidemia\n- DM2 - no known microvascular disease; last A1c 7.3 (June 36)\n- Ankylosing spondylitis\n- h/o thrombophlebitis (vs DVT) of left leg\n- hemorrhoids s/p banding\n\nHome meds: ASA 81, lipitor 20, metformin 500, zestril 10, toprol 25\n\n\t\n\n\tChanges to Allergies\n\t\nNKA: No Known Allergies - reaction: [reviewed]\n\n\n\tSocial history:\n   Lives with wife in Avra Valley, KS.

Since the surgery she has done\nquite well.  She was in Sibley Care Center from 4/08 to\n4/22/69 and had undergone physical therapy, occupational therapy\nand also education on dietary modification.  During her hospital\ncourse she had a repeat echocardiogram which revealed a left\nventricular ejection fraction of 50% and hypokinesis of the septal\nwall with mild to moderate pulmonary artery hypertension.  She was\nstarted on lisinopril to help prevent diabetic nephropathy.  She\nalso received two units of packed red blood cells at her stay at\nSibley Care as it was noted that her hematocrit was only 24. \nShe was also briefly treated with Epogen and it was felt that her\nrenal dysfunction may have been the cause of her low hematocrit. \nHer renal function has improved considerably since stopping\ndiuretics.  \n \nSince going home from Sibley Care, she is starting to walk more\nwith assistance from a physical therapist around the house.  She is\nnot experiencing any exertional chest pressure, pain or shortness\nof breath.  She also mentions she is currently going to a Diabetes\nSupport Group tomorrow and plans to get some psychotherapy through\nNorthern Illinois Medical Center later next month.\n \nMedications:  Her current medications are aspirin 81 mg. p.o. q.d.,\nlisinopril, increased to 20 p.o. daily today, Coumadin 5 p.o. q.d.,\nKayexalate 15 p.o. q. day, albuterol metered dose inhaler 4 puffs\nq.i.d., Azmacort 4 puffs b.i.d., Lasix 40 p.o. q. day, Nephrocaps\none tablet p.o. q. day, NPH Insulin 75 units q. a.m. and 60 units\nsubcu q. p.m., Prilosec 20 p.o. q.d., Paxil 30 mg. p.o. q. day and\nCPAP 8 centimeters water plus 2 liters O2 q. h.s.  \n \nPhysical Examination:  On physical examination her weight is 326\npounds.   Her blood pressure is 150/110, on repeat per M.D.\n150/100, pulse is 80.  Her skin is without any rashes or\necchymoses, or suspicious nevi present.  Heart regular rhythm,\ndistant heart sounds with positive S1 and S2.  Her lungs are clear,\nthere is no sternal instability and the sternal wound is well\nhealed.

She is clinically\n     doing quite well without any signs of congestive heart failure\n     or angina.  Her ejection fraction significantly improved\n     postoperatively.  I am concerned about a relatively high blood\n     pressure and the visiting nurses have reported that it has\n     been going up into the 180s systolic with ambulation.  I will\n     increase her lisinopril from 10 to 20 mg. with a careful watch\n     of her potassium.  \n \n2)   Chronic renal insufficiency.  Again we'll check regular labs\n     once to twice weekly monitoring renal function.  \n \n3)   Diabetes mellitus.  Stable.  Her blood pressure have been\n     under fairly good control.  She has also lost a significant\n     amount of weight over 20 pounds.  Her current weight is 326\n     pounds.  We'll check hemoglobin A1 with next blood draw.\n \n4)   Anemia of chronic disease.  We'll also recheck her blood count\n     and follow-up.\n \n5)   Obstructive sleep apnea.  The patient is using her CPAP\n     machine at night time and I've encouraged her to do so.\n \n6)   Hyperkalemia.  She will continue with the Kayexalate as\n     prescribed and also we'll continue to monitor her potassium\n     regularly over the next several months until they normalize.\n \n7)   Morbid obesity.  She is making good progress with her weight\n     loss.  She is going to continue on an out-patient program once\n     weekly and she is also going to be going for some mental\n     health counseling as well which will hopefully continue her on\n     a successful weight loss plan.Chandler, Jessica\nMRN #748-80-38-0\nMay 05, 2069\nPage 3 \n \n \nShe will follow-up with me in one month's time.\n \n \n \n \nRuby Ayala, M.D.\n \nDD: 05/09/69\nDT: 05/11/69\nDV: 05/05/69\n/denny \n \ncc:\nNoah Kimball, M.D.\nCardiac Surgery - FSH\n \nWilliam Wesley, M.D.\nCardiology Division - FSH\n   \n ******** Not reviewed by Attending Physician ********\nRecord date: 2070-01-08\n\n                     FSH EMERGENCY DEPT VISIT\n \nCHANDLER,JESSICA   748-80-38-0                       VISIT DATE: 01/08/70\nHISTORY OF PRESENTING COMPLAINT:  The patient was seen and \nevaluated by Dr. Wooten.  Please see Dr. Wooten's note.  The \npatient is a 41 year old morbidly obese diabetic female with two \ndays of shortness of breath and cough, productive of some whitish \nsputum.  She has had no chest pain, no nausea, no vomiting. \nMinimal diaphoresis.  She has had a fever.  No urinary symptoms. \nShe does have chronic renal insufficiency, COPD, CHF and diabetes. \nPAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  As above plus status post coronary artery \nbypass grafting. \nMEDICATIONS:  Lasix, Prilosec, Cozaar, aspirin, Paxil, Flovent, \nalbuterol and Nephrocaps. \nALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies. \nSOCIAL HISTORY:  A non-smoker. \nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  An obese female, mild acute distress. \nTemperature 101 degrees.  Heart has a regular rate and rhythm. \nLungs:  Diffuse rhonchi throughout with bibasilar rales.  The \nabdomen is obese, soft.  Neurologic exam is non-focal. \nLABORATORY EVALUATION:  Chest x-ray shows a poor inspiratory \neffort, no obvious infiltrate, perhaps some hazy infiltrates.  EKG \nis unchanged.  Labs:  Unable to obtain at this time. \nTHERAPY RENDERED/COURSE IN ED:  The patient was seen and evaluated. \nChest x-ray was obtained.  The patient has an IV established but \nwere unable to draw labs.  Under my direct supervision and with \nsome attempts by me, multiple attempts are made at the \ninfraclavicular and supraclavicular left and right subclavian vein \nwithout success.  The groins bilateral have damp, moist exudate and \nthe neck anatomy is difficult to assess.  We are unable to \nestablish a line.  She has a chest x-ray for rule out of \npneumothorax or hemothorax and she will need an arterial stick for \nblood draws. \nIMPRESSION:  Hypoxia, possible pneumonia and a facial abscess. \nPLAN:  Admission. \nDISPOSITION (including condition upon discharge):  Condition on \nadmission is stable. \n___________________________________                    RJ446/0820 \nRONNIE HUFFMAN, M.D.  RH31                       D:01/08/70 \n                                                       T:01/09/70 \nDictated by:  RONNIE HUFFMAN, M.D.  RH31 \n ******** Not reviewed by Attending Physician ********\nRecord date: 2070-07-28\n\n \n                           OFFICE NOTE\n                    FRANKFORT INTERNAL MEDICINE\n                       28 Bailey Street\n                            2nd Floor\n                    North Webster, SD  48493\n \n \nChandler, Jessica\nMRN: 748-80-38-0\n07/28/70\n \nJessica returns today for follow-up after her admission for acute\nshortness of breath and congestive heart failure.  I had added\nZaroxolyn on to her regimen which she is tolerating well.  However,\nher recent laboratory studies show that she has a significant\nincrease in her BUN and creatinine.  Her BUN is in the 80's, and\nher creatinine is about 3.4.  She states her breathing has been\nexcellent, however.  She is not experiencing as much dyspnea on\nexertion.  She is sleeping through the night, and she is no longer\nhaving any kind of dry cough.  \n \nMedications:  Her current medicines are Nephrocaps 1 tablet p.o.\nq.day, Paxil 20 p.o. q.day, Cozaar 50 p.o. q.day, Prilosec 20 mg\np.o. q. day, Atenolol 50 p.o. q.day, Lasix 120 p.o. b.i.d.,\nZaroxolyn 2.5 p.o. q.day, Albuterol nebulizers p.r.n., nph 40 units\nin the morning and 40 units at night time and aspirin 81 mg p.o.\nq.day.\n \nAllergies:  Cephalexin causes questionable rash.\n \nPhysical Examination:  Today she is a pleasant black female in no\nacute distress.  Her weight is 330 pounds.  This is down over 20\npounds over the past month.  Her blood pressure is 122/80.  Her\npulse is 80.  Her lungs are clear.  Her heart reveals distant heart\nsounds but regular in rhythm and rate.  Her extremities are notable\nfor the absence of lower extremity edema.  Her abdomen is also\nnoted to be significantly less edematous than it has been in the\npast.  Inspection of her left lower extremity reveals that she\ncontinues to have an ulcer over the lateral aspect of the foot on\nthe plantar surface that measures 2 x 3 cm.  There is beefy red\ngranulation tissue surrounding this.  \n \nDiagnosis:\n     1.   Congestive heart failure.  \n     2.   Coronary artery disease, status post CABG.\n     3.   Morbid obesity.\n     4.   Adult onset diabetes mellitus.\n     5.   Chronic renal insufficiency.\n     6.   Foot ulcer.\n     7.   Depression.\n     8.   Health maintenance.\n \n \n \nChandler, Jessica\nMRN: 748-80-38-0\n07/28/70\nPage Two\n \nPlan:\n     1.   Congestive heart failure.  She is doing much better on\nhigher doses of diuretics with a weight loss of over 20 pounds\nsince her last visit here about a month ago.  At this point in\ntime, however, I think that we need to cut back on her Zaroxolyn\ngiven the elevation in her BUN and creatinine, and I've asked her\nto hold her Zaroxolyn dosage and continue on a relatively low-fat\nand low-sodium diet and to have a scale and obtain daily weights,\nand she will follow-up with me in the office in two weeks and per\ntelephone conversation in four days.  Should she have an increase\nin her weight by more than five pounds, she will contact me.\n     2.   Coronary artery disease, status post CABG.  Stable\nwithout any symptoms of exertional chest pain.  Continue current\nmedication. \n     3.   Morbid obesity.  She decided not to go to the Frankfort State Hospital weight loss program.  I strongly wanted her to go\non a liquid protein diet plan, but she states it's inconvenient for\nher to come to the Hospital at night time for the meetings.  She is\nplanning to try and enroll in a program at Sibley Care.  I told her I would help her out in any way possible, but\nstrongly reinforced to her the need for her to take off weight.  \n     4.   Adult-onset diabetes mellitus.  Stable.  Continue current\nregimen.  \n     5.   Chronic renal insufficiency.  The plan as above is to\nstop Zaroxolyn and repeat electrolytes in five days. \n     6.   Diabetic foot ulcer.  I also gave her a duoderm dressing\nto try, and she is going to continue to follow-up with her\npodiatrist, and I will speak with her visiting nurse about\nappropriate treatment.\n \n \n \nRuby C.

On 1/31 he had symptoms similar to those he experienced prior to his MI in 2073: pain in back of left neck, left shoulder, and left arm.  As a result he did not exercise that day.  The symptoms improved spontaneously.  On 2/01 he did his normal exercise routine, running on the treadmill for 40 minutes; he felt fine.  Later that day, he had recurrence of the symptoms so he called Dr. Ishmael's answering service.  Dr. Patterson was covering and recommended he go to ED.  He is very impressed that Dr. Patterson saw him that evening in the ED.  There EKG showed no changes but troponin-I and CK screen were positive.  He was admitted to cardiology service and managed with integrullin and heparin.  When second set of enzymes was positive on 2/02 he went to cath lab, where old RCA stent was \"pristine,\" LAD showed stable 50% lesion, but distal LCx showed 90% lesion.  He had PTCA and stenting with medicated stent, producing excellent result.  He was discharged on 2/03 on plavix.\n\n\n\nToday, he says he has had no recurrence of symptoms.  He is feeling great.  He is concerned that he had the MI despite taking all his medications as prescribed and feeling so well with exercise.  He wonders whether he needs to re-start cardiac rehab.  He is avoiding exercise until he sees Dr. Ishmael next week.

He was seen in MHC \nclinic prior to that.  His LBH physician was Dr. Jaeger and his phone \nnumber is 872-9985.  Patient was last seen one year ago due to the fact \nthat he lost his job and his insurance with LBH and states that he has \nnot seen a physician in the past year.\n \nHis medical problems include:\n1.   Coronary artery disease with angioplasty in 2063.  It is unclear \n     which vessels were plastied.  \n2.   Hypercholesterolemia treated in the past with gemfibrozil and niacin \n     for coexistent hypertriglyceridemia.  However, he has not taken any \n     niacin or gemfibrozil for the past year as well. \n3.   Anxiety.\n4.   Condyloma last fall.\n \nMedications:  1) enteric coated aspirin 325mg q.d.; 2) lorazepam 1mg PO \nq.h.s. prescribed by Dr. Guadalupe Thacker at LBH.  Patient also had \nnitroglycerin tablets at home.  Patient used to use diltiazem 30mg PO \nt.i.d.; however, that was stopped a year ago when he lost his insurance.  \nHe does not have any history of hypertension in the past.\n \nSocial history:  He is currently not working.  He has been unemployed for \na month and a half.  He used to be a social worker which did not \ninvolve any heavy lifting.  He did community services managment.  He \nlives with his mother and his sister and has never been married.  \n \nReview of systems:  Patient states that he has very infrequent episodes of \nchest pains over the last 10 years.  However, he does say that his last \nchest pain was approximately a week and a half ago.  When asked where the \npain was he put his hand over this mid-epigastrium and stated that the \npain was very similar to the pain he used to have prior to his \nangioplasty.  He took two sublingual nitroglycerins and the pain was \nrelieved within a few minutes of the second nitroglycerin tablet.  At the \ntime he was just sitting on his couch watching television.  He has no \nhistory of exertional angina over the last several years.  However, this \ncomplaint of chest pain at rest is very worrisome for unstable angina.  He \ncurrently does not complain of any shortness of breath, dyspnea on \nexertion, palpitation, or pre-syncope.\n \nOn physical examination Mr. Orta is a middle-aged black male in no \napparent distress.  Temperature was afebrile.  Heart rate was 68 and \nregular.  Blood pressure was 126/92 in the right arm in a sitting \nposition.  HEENT was within normal limits.  Lungs were clear bilaterally.  \nHeart exam was regular rate and rhythm with no murmurs, rubs, or gallops.  \nAbdomen was benign.  Extremities were without edema or lesions.\n \nMHC INTERNAL MEDICINE ASSOCIATES          Orta, Phil\nPage 2                                        55931516\n                                              8-02-73\n \n                                              \n                                              \nAssessment and Plan:\n \n1.   Cardiovascular.  Patient clearly has coronary artery disease given \n     his past history of angioplasty and his recent complaint of chest \n     pain at rest is worrisome for unstable angina.  Given that he is on \n     no current cardiac medication except for aspirin, I will decide to \n     initiate therapy with diltiazem CD 120mg PO q.d. in an attempt to \n     control his blood pressure and heart rate.  I also encouraged him to \n     continue his aspirin daily and gave him a fresh bottle of \n     nitroglycerin tablets for use with any chest pain in the near future.  \n     The plan will be to get the patient on stable dose of diltiazem and \n     maximize the dose for his heart and blood pressure control.  After he \n     has been on a stable dose for several days, we will perform an \n     outpatient stress test to evaluate whether the patient has any \n     evidence of ischemia at this time.  If he does, we will recommend a \n     cardiac catheterization to treat any potential lesions which may be \n     causing syms of rest angina.  The case was discussed with any \n     cardiacs that are on call.\n \n2.   Given the patient's history of coronary artery disease I sent an \n     SMA-20 level off to assess for hypercholesterolemia which he does \n     have with a cholesterol of 291 and hypertriglyceridemia which he also \n     has at a level of 336.  He has been taking gemfibrozil and niacin in \n     the past; however, he has not been taking it for the last year.  I \n     instructed him to decrease the amount of cholesterol and fats in his \n     diet and explained which food contain those products.  I will also \n     initiate treatment with a HMG CoA inhibitor which should decrease \n     both his cholesterol as well as the triglycerides.  We will start him \n     off on simvastatin 20mg PO q.d. later this week.\n \n3.   Daily anxiety.  Will continue the patient's Ativan in an attempt to \n     control his daily anxiety which he says is well controlled without \n     Ativan.\n \n4.   History of condyloma in his genital area from last year.  Patient \n     states that he currently has several lesions which we will examine on \n     his next visit.  If he does, we will refer him to dermatology for \n     liquid nitrogen treatment to remove the lesions.\n \nMHC INTERNAL MEDICINE ASSOCIATES          Orta, Phil\nPage 3                                        55931516\n                                              8-02-73\n \n                                              \n                                              \n5.

He is a 71-year-old, right-handed man who was admitted to the Sutton Family Care on December 29, 2088 with left arm weakness, ataxia and dysarthria.  The impression at that time was for lacunar stroke.  An MRI showed a larger area of infarct in the right corona radiata.  The patient had worsening weakness on the night of admission, despite being heparinized.  The following day, he had a flaccid hemiparesis of the left side.  Further workup included a magnetic resonance angiogram that showed irregularity of the proximal middle cerebral arteries bilaterally.  There was no critical carotid stenosis.  He had an embolic workup which consisted of an echocardiogram showing a preserved ejection fraction, dilated left atrium, very mild inferior hypokinesis, and no patent foramen ovale.  He had a Holter monitor which did not reveal any dysrhythmias.  His cholesterol level was 152 with an HDL of 23.  It was felt that his stroke was most likely due to atherosclerosis of the middle cerebral artery, involving either one or possibly several lenticulostriate arteries.  He did not have any evidence of a flow limiting MCA stenosis.  He had been on aspirin prior, Plavix was added to his regimen.   \n\n\nSince his discharge from the hospital, he has been in rehabilitation for the last two months.  He has had no further episodes of weakness, numbness, tingling, ataxia, dysarthria, or dysphagia.  He has no symptoms of aphasia.  He has been left with some dysarthria from his initial event, which he feels has improved.  I would agree with him.  He also has regained some strength in the left leg, and is currently working on using a walker with assistance.  Unfortunately, he has not regained any use of the left arm.  He has not had any problems with spasms.   \n\n\nHis past medical history is significant for hypertension and type II diabetes mellitus.  He had an inferior myocardial infarction in 2060.  He had a quadruple bypass in 2083.  His last stress test in 2087 showed moderate inferolateral ischemia in the region of a prior myocardial infarct.  He has pulmonary disease due to asbestosis.  He has chronic renal failure and neuropathy secondary to his diabetes.  He has also had laser surgery for diabetic retinopathy.  \n \nHis medications currently include clonidine .1 mg. p.o. b.i.d., Plavix 75 mg. p.o. q.d., aspirin 325 mg. p.o. q.d., Neurontin 300 mg. p.o. q.h.s., Gemfibrozil 600 mg. p.o. b.i.d., Isordil and Lasix.  He had been on Captopril earlier, but he has since been taken off that medicine.  He was managed with insulin during his prior admission.  I assume he is still on this medicine, although he did not specifically state so.  He has an allergy to sulfa drugs.  \n \nThe patient lives with a friend who works at Marble Slab Creamery.  The patient quit smoking 15 years ago and only rarely drinks alcohol on social occasions.  There is a history of coronary artery disease in his father and at least one of his brothers, but no family history of stroke.  \n \nOn examination, he was a pleasant gentleman in no apparent distress.  His blood pressure was 150/90.  His language was intact.  His speech was somewhat dysarthric, although this was improved from his admission.  He was alert and oriented.  His conversation was appropriate.  The visual fields were full.  The pupils were equal and reactive at 4 mm.  Facial sensation was normal.  There was an upper motor neuron left facial droop.  The tongue and palate were midline.  The patient had 0/5 flaccid hemiplegia of the left arm.  There was atrophy of the left biceps.  There was full range of motion of the joints.  The patient had 2/5 left iliopsoas, 4+/5 hip extensors, 3/5 left quadriceps, 3/5 left ankle dorsiflexors, and 3/5 ankle plantar flexors.  The tone in the lower extremities was not increased.  His right side was 5/5.  He had hyperreflexia of the left side and an equivocal toe.  His right toe was downgoing.  Sensation was intact to light touch and pinprick.  I could not find any evidence to pinprick of his neuropathy.  Vibration sense was very mildly reduced at the toes.  He was in a wheelchair, and his gait was not assessed.  \n \nMr. Parrish's recovery is progressing.  He has regained some strength in his left leg and his goal is to be able to walk on his own with either a cane or walker.  I hope that this will be the case.  Unfortunately, his left arm has remained flaccid and he has no movement.  I told him that his left arm will most likely remain with severe weakness.  His stroke was most likely related to atheroma of the middle cerebral artery and lenticulostriate arteries.  I would encourage his blood pressure to be controlled, as has been done, and to continue an anticholesterol agent.  I believe he has been on Gemfibrozil for a while.  The literature suggests benefit for the statin drugs in primary prevention of stroke in patients with elevated cholesterol.  I do not think that gemfibrozil has been studied in the same way.  However, since he has been on this medicine so long, it may be worthwhile to continue using it if it is controlling his total cholesterol well.  He should continue on an aspirin a day.  He states that he is having difficulty obtaining Plavix due to the cost.  I recommended to him that, in the experience of the Stroke Service at Sutton Family Care, patients in his situation do benefit from being on Plavix for a period of time after a stroke of this type.  We recommended to him that he continue on Plavix for another six months because of this.   This should give adequate time for any ulcerated or unstable plaque in his middle cerebral artery to heal.  After six months, if he has had no further clinical events, it would be reasonable to assume that his atheroma is stable and that he could be adequately treated with aspirin.  I will see him again in clinic in approximately six months.  I will arrange for carotid noninvasives and anterior transcranial Dopplers to evaluate his carotid and middle cerebral artery in approximately one year's time.  \n \nThe patient was seen and examined by Dr. Laith Greene of the Sutton Family Care Stroke Service, who was present for all relevant portions of the history and physical examination.  \n \nSincerely, \n \n \n\n\n\nJohnathan Kiefer, M.

The subtle but real changes in the ECG and the non-zero troponin are also concerning.

He had an ETT per patient report in Georgia which was neg for ischemia 4 years ago.  He claims excellent exercise tolerance can run at least 3 miles without SOB or CP but does not exercise regularly.   At concert on day of admission, he was sitting at rest when he had sudden onset of crushing sub-sternal chest pain, 8/10, no radiation, associated with mild SOB and marked diaphoresis.  Pt reported some associated back pain with onset, like \"I was being crushed like a sandwich.\"  Was not eating at time, not like heartburn, no fevers, chills, cough, or chest trauma.  EMT was called-2 SL ntg relieved pain, was given ASA. \n\n\n\nOn arrival to the ED, he was chest pain free.  His HR was 52-60 in normal sinus rhythm.  On hindsight, EKG showed sinus bradycardia with 1mm STE in III,    mm aVF, 1mm STD in I, ? aVL with biphasic T in I, TWI in aVL.  He received ASA and SLTNG\n\nCardiac RF include tobacco (1/2 ppd x 30 yrs) and early family hx (Dad died of MI, first MI at 41).  No known HTN, DM, or hyperlipidemia.  \n\n\n\nCourse on floor:\n\n\n\nSeen for initial H&P when patient came to CCU5.  During exam, patient became acutely diaphoretic, appeared uncomfortable, still complaining of CP with some mild back pain.  \n\nBP:  L arm 105/66, R arm 90/63. (2 rpt BPs were equal on both arms within 5 mm Hg) HR bradycardia in high 40s, sat 98% 2L.

As you know, Mr. Urban is a very pleasant 50-year-old gentleman who on July 09, 2093, while sitting at a concert in Central Park had the sudden onset of feeling    unwell   , epigastric discomfort, and profound diaphoresis.  He came to the Worthington Regional Hospital Emergency Room at that time.  By the time he arrived, his symptoms had abated.  He had an unremarkable electrocardiogram initially and negative cardiac markers, and was admitted to the medicine service to rule-out a myocardial infarction.  That evening, he had recurrent symptoms and was noted to have sustained wide complex tachycardia, which appears to be ventricular tachycardia.  He was transferred to the Cardiac Care Unit for further management.  The next morning, he underwent cardiac ultrasound, which revealed an ejection fraction of 28% and a diffusely hypokinetic left ventricle with an akinetic inferior wall.  Additionally his next set of cardiac markers returned positive.  He therefore went cardiac catheterization revealing a total occlusion of his right coronary artery and minimal non-obstructive disease of the left system.  This artery was stented with total of three stents (two Express stents 2.5 x 24 mm and one Pixel stent 2.5 x 28 mm), encompassing the entire length of the right coronary artery.  A left ventriculogram was performed and demonstrated an ejection fraction of 30% with a diffusely hypokinetic ventricle and and akinetic inferior wall.  He ruled in for myocardial infarction with a peak CK of 1490 and a peak troponin of 2.0.  A follow-up echocardiogram was performed on July 15, 2093. This study showed his ejection fraction had improved to 36%; the left ventricle was diffusely hypokinetic and the inferior wall appeared severely hypokinetic.  His reduced ejection fraction was out of proportion to his degree of coronary disease.  Because of this, a series of laboratory tests were performed which revealed normal iron studies, normal thyroid function, and a normal serum protein electrophoresis pattern. He was discharged in stable condition to follow up with me as an outpatient.\n\n\n\nSince his myocardial infarction, Mr. Urban has been feeling quite well.  He has returned to work in the factory where his employed as a manufacturing manager.  He has had no symptoms of angina, dyspnea, nausea, or diaphoresis.  He has felt very well.  He continues to take his medications without difficulty, and denies any symptomatology whatsoever.\n\n\n\nHis past medical history prior to this hospitalization is largely unremarkable because he had not sought medical care.  Of note, he reports to me that about 8 or 9 years ago while living in Georgia, he presented to an emergency room with some chest discomfort.  He was evaluated and released.  He never had any further testing.  He did not have a stress test, cardiac ultrasound or catheterization.  Prior to his admission, he did not have any known hypertension or hyperlipidemia, but has been diagnosed with these conditions while in the hospital.\n\n\n\nHis medications include aspirin 325 mg daily, Plavix 75 mg daily, Lipitor 20 mg daily, lisinopril 10 mg daily, and carvedilol 6.25 mg twice each day.  He has no known drug allergies.\n\n\n\nMs. Urban is originally from Nicaragua but after working for Imports, Inc, he moved to Georgia where he lived for 24 years working as a Registered Nurse and in various other positions.  He immigrated to America about a year or so ago.  He has been working in Borders.  He currently lives in Toledo, Montana, with his wife.  He has no children.  He smoked 1 to 1-1/2 packs per day for about 30 years, but has not smoked since his hospitalization.  He drinks only socially and denies illicit drug use.\n\n\n\nHe has a family history of coronary artery disease in that his father had 3 myocardial infarctions and died at a young age of heart disease.\n\n\n\nOn physical exam, his blood pressure was 130/82 mmHg in his right arm and 126/80 mmHg in his left arm.  His heart rate is 60 and regular.  In general, he is in no apparent distress.  His jugular venous pressure is 6 cm of water.  His chest is clear to auscultation without rales, wheezes, or rhonchi.  His heart is regular in rhythm and rate with a normal S1 and S2.  He has no murmurs, rubs, or gallops.  His abdomen is benign.  His extremities are warm and well perfused and without clubbing, cyanosis, or edema.  On vascular exam his carotid pulses are 2+, brisk and without bruits.  His femoral pulses are 2+, brisk and without bruits.  His right femoral artery was entered for cardiac catheterization.  The site looks clean and intact with no hematoma and no bruit and a strong pulse.  His distal pulses are 2+ and symmetric throughout.\n\n\n\nHis lipid panel from his hospitalization reveals total cholesterol of 210 mg/dl, LDL of 153 mg/dl, and HDL of 45mg/dl.\n\n\n\nHis electrocardiogram revealed normal sinus rhythm.  He has T wave inversions in III and aVF, and he has a greater than 15 degree disparity between his R and T wave axis.\n\n\n\nMr. Urban underwent a exercise treadmill test with sestamibi imaging yesterday.  He exercised for 10 minutes 43 seconds achieving a maximum workload of 12 METS, and a peak double product of 21,600.  His electrocardiogram was negative for ischemia.  His nuclear images revealed a mild reduction in tracer activity in the inferior wall which persisted after reinjection consistent with his inferior myocardial infarction. There was no evidence of ischemia elsewhere.  His left ventricular ejection fraction was measured at 51%.\n\n\n\nIn short, Mr. Urban is a 51-year-old who had an inferior myocardial infarction, but interestingly during his hospitalization had systolic dysfunction well out of proportion to his coronary disease.  Also, his systolic function has improved over time.  I think there are two processes going on.  One is coronary artery disease.  Clearly this has manifested itself as an inferior myocardial infarction due to an occluded right coronary artery, which was treated during his hospitalization with stenting.  The other issue is his transient systolic dysfunction that is out of proportion to his coronary artery disease.  Given the rapid improvement in his ejection fraction, I can only speculate as to the etiology of this.  He does not appear to have a persistent cardiomyopathy, but a transient one.  I suspect that this is myocarditis.  Unfortunatley, I have no way of proving this for certain but clinically it seems to fit.  It is possible that whatever led to his myocarditis also triggered his acute coronary syndrome.  \n\n\n\nFrom the aspect of his coronary artery disease, he will continue on aspirin for life.  He received quite a substantial amount of stenting to his right coronary artery, and I would opt to continue his Plavix for at least 12 months.  For his hyperlipidemia, I agree with Lipitor, and we will recheck his lipid profile to see if the dose of Lipitor is adequate.  His LDL goal will be less than 100.  He is well beta-blocked on his carvedilol, and we will continue with the current dose of 6.25 mg twice daily.  His blood pressure allows us to increase his lisinopril from 10 to 15 mg daily.  I will see Mr. Urban again in three months for followup.  I will repeat his echocardiogram in six months' time to see where his ejection fraction has settled out.\n\n\n\nThank you for allowing me to participate in the care of this very interesting and pleasant gentleman.  The patient was seen and examined, and the case was discussed with Dr. Orville Ness.\n\n\n\nSincerely,\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJimmy Orozco, M.D.\n\n\n\nJO/0564\n\nFI:  400908\n\nDD:  08/19/93\n\nDT:  08/20/93\nRecord date: 2094-05-11\n\nPatient Name:  Urban, Russell\n\nPatient ID:  472-20-64\n\nProvider Name:  Orozco, Jimmy\n\nDate of Visit:  05/11/2094\n\nVisit Type:  Return Visit\n\n\n\n\n\nJohn Ussery, M.D.\n\nWorthington Internal Medicine\n\n28 Shattuck Street, IM 270\n\nCitrus Ridge, MT 43782\n\n\n\nDear Dr. Ussery:\n\n\n\nI saw Mr. Urban in follow-up in the office today.  Since his last visit in November, he has been feeling well.  He has had no angina, no exertional dyspnea, no shortness of breath, no orthopnea, no paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, no palpitations, and no other symptoms of note.  Since his last visit with me, he has participated in and completed outpatient cardiac rehabilitation.  He found this program to be very helpful; he sis very well with the program.  He is currently exercising on a regular basis and has no chest discomfort of dyspnea with exercise.  He has stopped smoking.  There have been no difficulties with his medications.  \n\n\n\nOn 03/16/2094, he had a follow-up echocardiogram done; this study shows an LV ejection fraction of 37% with septal hypokinesis and inferoposterior akinesis; there is trace mitral regurgitation; and aortic sclerosis, but no stenosis.  Notably, he has a right ventricular systolic pressure estimated to be 46 mmHg with a right ventricle that is mildly dilated and mildly-to-moderately hypokinetic.  He has been feeling quite well and has no other symptoms.\n\n\n\nHis review of systems is as above and is otherwise negative in detail.\n\n\n\nMedications:\n\nAspirin 325 mg daily\n\nPlavix 75 mg daily \n\nLipitor 40 mg daily\n\nlisinopril 10 mg daily\n\nCoreg 6.25 mg daily.\n\n\n\n\n\nPhysical examination:\n\nHe appears quite well and is in no apparent distress.  His blood pressure is 112/60 mmHg and his pulse rate is 50 beats per minutes and regular.  His JVP is 7 cm of water with no Kussmaul's sign.  His chest is clear to auscultation bilaterally.  His heart is regular in rhythm and rate with a normal S1 and S2.  He has no S3 or S4 gallop and no audible murmurs.  His abdomen is soft.  It is neither tender nor distended.  He has normal bowel sounds.  His extremities are warm and well perfused.  He has no edema.\n\n\n\nImpression:  This is a 50 year-old man with coronary disease who suffered an inferoposterior myocardial infarction in July 2093.  Additionally, he was also found to have cardiomyopathy with an LV ejection fraction of 37 percent.  He is currently asymptomatic from his coronary disease and his LV dysfunction.  Notably, his last echocardiogram shows that he has increased RV systolic pressure and some early right ventricular dysfunction.  The etiology of this right ventricular dysfunction is not clear.  There is likely a component of left heart failure.  In addition, he may have right heart failure out-of-proportion to left heart failure: he has a longstanding smoking history and may have a degree of COPD and, lastly, he may have obstructive sleep apnea.  He reports to me that he does snore at night, and his first wife in Georgia had told him for many years that during the night he had periods were he would stop breathing.  This raises obstructive sleep apnea as a consideration.  \n\n\n\nRecommendations: Initially, I am going to start him on Lasix 20 mg daily to lower his preload to help with any component of LV failure that is leading to this.  The rest of his regimen is quite good, and I intend to continue them.  To help to see if there is any component of cor pulmonale that may be contributing to this, I am going to obtain first a chest x-ray, secondly a pulmonary function testing, and lastly a sleep study.  If indeed we find components of obstructive lung disease or obstructive sleep apnea, we will have him see a pulmonologist and treat these accordingly.  I will see him again in six months' time.\n\n\n\nThank you for allowing me to participate in the care of this pleasant gentleman.\n\n\n\nRegards,\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n__________________________\n\nJimmy J.

He underwent RCA stenting at that time, jailing the RV marginal with sluggish flow afterward. Post MI ECHO showed EF of 36% w/diffuse HK.\n\n     He underwent f/u ETT w/imaging in 8/93 which showed a small fixed inferior defect with considerable residual viable myocardium and no evidence of ischemia. EF at that time was 51%. He has done reasonably well since then.\n\n    In late spring, Mr Urban noted some chest tightness and SOB similar in quality to his prior angina, but markedly less severe, which occurred with exertion. He had a repeat ETT 7/31/95. EKG was positive for ischemia. Imaging showed a defect that was c/w ischemia. His meds were adjsuted, but his symptoms have persisted.\n\n    Today he presented for elective cath +/- via SDA. Cath showed his RCA to be totally occluded, with 2 LCX lesions. His LCX was stented with 2 cyphers (3.5 x13 and 3 x 23) with good results. He was put on reopro and transferred to Cardiology where he arrived pain free and in no distress. \n\n\n\nPast Medical History\t\n\nCAD\n\ns/p IMI, RCA stent x 2 2093\n\nCardiomyopathy\n\nCHF\n\nHyperlipidemia\n\nHypertension\n\nOSA\n\n\n\nAllergies\t\n\nNKDA\n\n\n\nSocial History\t\n\nMarried, lives with wife\n\nWorks in Borders\n\n\n\nHabits\t\n\nETOH: occasional social\n\nSmoking: 45 pkyr hx, none for 2 yrs\n\nCaffeine: 2-3 cups in am daily\n\nDiet: low fat, low chol, NAS\n\nExercise: was walking regularly until symptoms recurred\n\n\n\nFamily History\t\n\nFather with MI x3 at early age\n\n\n\nMedications\t\n\nAt Home:\n\n\n\nASA 81 mg QD\n\nLisinopril 10 mg QD\n\nCoreg 6.25 mg BID\n\nLasix 20 mg QD\n\nLipitor 80 mg qPM\n\nKlonipin 1 mg qPM\n\n\n\n\n\nPhysical Exam\t\n\nHeight: 73\n\nWeight: 182\n\n\n\nVS: 90-110/60's, 50-60\n\nMonitor: SR\n\n\n\nGen: well appearing caucasian male in NAD\n\n\n\nNeuro: alert, oriented x 3, speech clear and articulate.

Ongoing secondary prevention and risk factor modification will continue to be paramount in Mr. Urban's care. I have discussed these issues with him in detail. \n\n\n\nI would like to obtain another echocardiogram to re-assess his ejection fraction which has been low in the past.  Also, I would like to see if he has had further development of pulmonary hypertension.  He will continue his current medications and return to see me in six months' time or sooner if need be.\n\n\n\nChanges to Medications this visit\n\n\t\t\t\n\nlisinopril 10 mg  po qd QTY:90 Refills:3 Start: 08/24/2093\n\nCoreg 6.25mg  PO BID QTY:180 Refills:2 Start: 08/24/2093\n\natorvastatin 80 mg  po qd QTY:90 Refills:3 Start: 08/24/2093\n\nZetia 10mg  po qd QTY:90 Refills:3\n\nLasix 20 mg  po qd QTY:90 Refills:3 Start: 06/06/2094\n\naspirin 325 mg  po qd QTY:90 Refills:3 Start: 08/24/2093\n\nKlonopin 1.0mg  po QPM QTY:30 Refills:3 Start: 05/01/2095\n\nCPAP     Nocturnal.\n\n\n\n\t\t\tSigned electronically by   Jimmy  Orozco MD  on  May 09, 2096"}

He left Angels City after I saw him in January when he was free of angina.  While taking an afternoon walk in Quito during early June he experienced fairly severe mid-sternal pain without diaphoresis; pain radiated  to the left upper arm and patient discribed it  as \"sharp burning pressure\".  He went back home and rest releived the pain he estimates within 15 minutes. There days later pain reccurred, again it lasted about 15 minutes but this time he went to ED.  An EKG was \"normal\" and he was discharged on NG. Approximately one week later he experienced another episode of CP similar to the previous ones, he was taken to another hospital and he was hospitalized. On July 1st he was catheterized and found to have \"diffuse CAD\" involving several vessels. Stent placement was not attempted. His LV EF was 55% and he was transferred to a medical ward. A day later, on July 3rd, he was readmitted to the ICU because of CP; he was stabilized and eventually discharged on July 5 on the following medication: \n\n\nASA 81 mg\nPlavix 75 mg po qd\nBisoprolol 5mg po qd\nIsosorbide 20 mg one po in am 1/2 po in pm\nRanitidine 300 mg po qd\nLipitor 40 mg po qd\nA sleeping medication 3 mg ?Lexotan one po hs\nMetformin 1000 mg po bid\n\n\nMr. Austin has been pain free since his discharge until today when he was readying himself to come to the hospital. He then  experienced a brief episode of pain in mid sternum without radiation to the left shoulder which had been present during previous episodes. It is worth noting that ETT here  in 2091 was suggestive of CAD but stress echocardiogram was  was read as not suggestive of ischemia:\n\n\nTesting performed:  STRESS ECHO, DOPPLER, COLOR DOPPLER     M-Mode:        2D Quality: Conclusion:     1.  Patient exercised  6 min 20 sec on a standard Bruce treadmill protocol,    reaching stage 3, and stopped secondary to fatigue.  No chest pain was    reported.  Maximal heart rate attained was 123 bpm (84% of maximum HR    predicted for age), and BP at peak exercise was 154/68.    The maximum    rate-pressure product was 18,942.2.  See exercise report for full ECG details.        Baseline resting ECG is normal sinus rhythm.      There were 1 mm horizontal/upsloping ST depressions in leads V3-6 and      lead II at peak exercise.3.  Baseline resting echocardiogram reveals:         Normal left ventricular size and systolic function.  Estimated resting       ejection fraction is 60%. No resting segmental wall motion       abnormalities.       Trace mitral regurgitation.4.  Echocardiographic images obtained immediately following peak exercise    reveal:      Normal increase in overall systolic function, with an estimated ejection      fraction of &gt;80%.      All segments augment normally, without inducible wall motion      abnormalities.SUMMARY:  No echocardiogrphic evidence of infarct or inducible ischemia, atslightly less than target heart rate (which decreases the sensitivity of thisexam).ATTENDING STAFF:        WINSTON,LATASHA V.,M.D.,PH.D.\n  \nMr. Austin has  Type II diabetes on oral hypoglycemics and h/o CVA in 2090 which resulted in right hemiparesis (now fully resolved) who was last seen in January.  At that time he denied any symptoms suggestive of angina.   \n\n\nGlycemic control ahs been variable.  Last HGBA1C in 11/85 was 7.8.  Lately there has been an increase in fating levels.  Today BG 162. Last week 112 at home. He is no longer exercising.  Has nocturia X2 but without dysuria. Denies polyuria, polydipsia, nause, chills and fever. Appetite normal. \n\n\n He has residual right shoulder pain after a fall in Dec 2094 which was significantly improved by  steroid injections.

As you know, he is a 78-year-old gentleman with diabetes who was hospitalized at 06/28/2096 in Quito with any acute coronary syndrome with anterior myocardial infarction.  I am seeing him on your request to evaluate him for possible coronary artery bypass surgery.  I have reviewed his records and I have summarized the findings.   \n\n\n\nThe patient denies having had symptoms of angina until his recent visit to Quiti.  At that time in June he had several days of very sharp chest tightness and diaphoresis that were prolonged.  He then presented to the Merlin Clinic in Quuto. He was found to have an anterior myocardial infarction and underwent catheterization there that showed a critical stenosis of the LAD ( sequential lesions 95 and 99%), first OM(90%) and his right ( dominant vessel with an 80% proximal and then 90%  distal). An LV gram showed an EF of 55% with just mild mitral regurgitation.  An echo performed here at the Wyandot was consistent. \n\n\n\nSince he has returned to America several weeks ago, he has only had one episode of his chest discomfort, which occurred when he was getting rushed to come to the clinic. Since then, he has had no further episodes. \n\n\nROS: Denies PND, orthopnea, symptoms of TIA, stroke, lightheaded, or syncope. He does get some pain in his right leg with exertion.\n\n\nPMH: Diabetes, hypertension, hypercholesterolemia,  stroke (numbness in his right hand and leg, but that had predominantly resolved).\n\n\nMeds: aspirin 81 mg a day, clopidogrel 75 mg a day, bisoprolol 5 mg once a day, ranitidine 300 mg a day, atorvastatin 40 mg a day, metformin 1000 mg b.i.d., and Imdur 20 mg in the morning and 10 in the evening. This is an Equadorian formulation.\n\n\nSHx:\nHe does not drink, nor smoke.\n\n\nFHx:  Cancer of the prostate and a mother who died of cancer at 60. Brother who is diabetic and the other who had cancer of the prostate.\n\n\n\nOn exam, he looks well. His heart rate is in the 64. His blood pressure was 115/70. His carotids were 2+ with normal upstrokes and no bruits. His jugular venous pressures were not elevated. His chest was clear to auscultation. His cardiac exam revealed a  2/6 holosystolic murmur at the apex. His abdomen was soft. Extremities were warm and well perfused with good femoral and distal pulses. Neurological exam is grossly normal without focal deficit.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn summary, Mr. Oswaldo is a very nice Spanish speaking 78-year-old gentleman with diabetes and a significant 3-vessel disease. He is likely best suited for CABG and I spent a significant amount of time explaining why stenting his situation would be less satisfactory.  I will obtain a screening duplex ultrasound of his carotids to assess this risk prior to proceeding.\n\n\n\nWith warm regards,  \n\n\nSincerely yours,\nRecord date: 2096-10-04\n\nGraydon Harold Jean, MD \nNevada Hospital\nInternal Medicine 72 Dan Chan\nAngels City, NH 31731\n\n\nDear Dr. Jean:\n\n\n\n\n \n\nYour patient Henry Oswaldo was seen today by myself at the Atmore Community Hospital today following coronary artery bypass on August 15, 2096 .  He has had a relatively unremarkable recovery with out complication.  Today,  Mr. Oswaldo  looks and feels well, and complains of no issues.    On examination, the lungs are clear, cardiac rate and rhythm are normal. The  incision is healing very nicely.   \n\n\nChest radiograph reveals normal findings.  EKG shows no acute changes and is basically normal.  His rate is mildly elevated today despite being on a beta blocker. \n\n\nPatient education was completed with respect to:  medication review, weight restriction/lifting/activities, cardiac rehabilitation.\n\n\nOverall, I am quite pleased with progress.   He has increased activity and should plan to enroll in cardiac rehabilitation in a few weeks.  He  seems to be making an excellent recovery from surgery.  \n\n\nThank you for the privilege of participating in the care of this very nice gentleman.  I am confident the surgery will afford  significant and lasting benefit and relief from symptoms of angina .  I would consider increasing his Toprol dose, but will leave this to your discretion if his rate remains elevated in follow-up. I am releasing  him to your care.  We would be happy to see him at any time in the future, if you should so desire.  \n\n\n\nWith warm regards,  \n\n\nSincerely yours,\nRecord date: 2096-11-18\n\n\n\n\n\nSpanish\n71 Dan Chan                                        OSWALDO AUSTIN, HENRY\nAngels City, NH 31731                                      64415974\n(729) 481-3539                                           11/18/96\n\n\n\n\nHISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: \n\n\nMr. Austin is a 78 year old Ecuadorian gentleman with known Diabetes and history of cerebellar CVA who returns to the practice three months after undergoing CABG for multiple vessel disease. His recovery was been uneventful, he has had no further angin and inspite rather severe anemia he has noted marked improvement in exercise tolerance. Appetite is better. No PND orthopnea or ankle edema. There is mild chest soreness on the right side.  There was aignificant decline in Hct in spite of the fact that he received 2 transfusions in the hospital and he is on iron.

Avoiding all salt in diet with good compliance.  Did see sleep lab tech, tried new settings and mask on new machine, but still tolerates poorly.  When discussed in some detail, notes feelings of suffocation with wearing mask for any period of time.  Also notes sense of being tied down frrom mask very difficult to tolerate.  Without exploring details greatly, we discussed potential role of PTSD in precipitating symptoms related to mask use, and potentially  the effect of nocturnal hypoxia and RV strain on accumulation of fluid.  Improving tolerance of CPAP seems very key.  Pt has started atkins dt with good success (6# in first week), and improving BGs are requiring reduction in insulin, which is great.  so it seems that addressing OSA is the key to improving overall status now.  We discussed some options...Including potential for tracheostomy to fix this without having to address mask, but agreed to try to initiate trial of CBT to see if we can improve mask talerance with symptom reduction.  He remains quite clear that he has no interest in furhter \"exploring\" the PTSD history, and I reassured him that CBT does not require doing this.  \n\n\n\nOSA:  Likely has near optimal mask set up now...We'll explore potential for CBT with sleep center or perhaps cardiac rehab source.  Hopefully this would address fluid imbalance to a greater extent as well.  \n\n\n\nDM:  improving with wt loss and diet.  Agree with insulin taper as sugars drop.

A cardiac echo revealed EF of 64% with no valvular disease and normal wall motion. An Aden MIBI 4/25 revealed inferior and PL ischemia and he was taken to the cath lab. The cath revealed mild pulmonary hypertension, PCW of 14, co-dominance with 65% PDA, moderate LCX disease and severe proximal LAD lesion. HE subsequently underwent CABG with LIMA to LAD, radial artery to LCX and VG to PDA. 1/26 he noted progressive DOE with upper chest discomfort and was brought to the cath lab. His PA pressure was 45/20 with a PCW of 20, all grafts were open and his BB and lasix were increased.\n\nAn Aden MIBI 12/27 showed an EF of 60% w small PB scar & inferior-lateral ischemia. Echo 2/28 revealed new LA enlargement with EF of 62%. He was admitted 1/29 with HF exacerbation/acute renal failure in the setting of rapid out-patient diureses with zaroxolyn.  (BUN 74, creat 2.2) Diuretics as well as Glucophage and ACE I were held and he was discharged with a creat of 1.2. An echo revealed new mild MR and RF of 59%. \n\nOver the last few months he has noted episodes of sudden lightheadedness/dizziness, floaters. He would take his BP with a home machine and it could be as low as 77/47. In addition, he has noted progressive DOE as well an now rest angina that is requiring a SL TNG for relief. He has 3 flights of stairs to climb to his apartment and uses 1 SL TNG prophylactically.  \n\nAn exercise adenosine MIBI was done 6/14 which revealed an EF of 75% with mild anterior  and IPL ischemia. He was admitted for a cardiac cath 6/20, however due to a creatinine of 2.4 only a right heart cath was done. It revealed  RAP of 7, RVP of 36/17, PAP of 35/17, PCW of 17 and CO 5.9.\n\nGiven his episodes of sudden hypotension as well as increasing creatinine, Diltiazem as well as Ramipril and Aldactone have been held. He reports no further episodes of hypotension since stopping these meds.\n\nHe is being followed by Dr You in renal service.\n\nOf note, he continues to use the oxygen at night.(2 liters NP)\n\n\n\nCardiac cath today revealed normal LM, TO mid LAD with LIMA to LAD filling distal LAD, mild LCX disease, RCA is totally occluded with distal vessel filling via VG to RPDA, VG to RCA small vessel but patent, LIMA to LAD patent. Althought the RA graft to the PDA and VG to LCX are patent - they are small and atretic.\n\n\n\n\t\t\tPast medical history:\n\n   CAD\n\nIDDM x 10 yrs\n\nretinopathy s/p laser \n\nHTN\n\nCRI\n\nOSA - can't tolerate CPAP\n\nLBP\n\nbilateral claudication if he walks fast\n\nreactive airway disease\n\nPTSD\n\nRecovering alcoholic - sober x 16 years\n\nremote ulcer - in his 20's\n\nCHF - dry wt 215\n\n\n\nPSHx:\n\nCABG 25 with LIMA to LAD, radial artery to RPDA, VG to LCX\n\n\n\n\t\t\tMedications (Confirmed):\n\n\t\t\t\n\naspirin 325 mg QD\n\nAtrovent 18 mcg/spray inh tid\n\nFlonase 1 spray BID\n\nfurosemide 80 mg qam\n\nisosorbide mononitrate 30 mg qd\n\nLipitor 80 mg QHS\n\nNephrocaps 1 tab qd\n\nToprol XL 100 mg qd\n\nu100 NPH insulin\n\nZetia 10 mg qd\n\n\n\nAllergies:\n\n\t\t\t\n\nDrug reaction   lisinopril causes cough\n\n\n\n\t\t\tFamily history:\n\n   father mild MI age 59\n\n\n\n\t\t\tSocial history:\n\n   divorced, quit smoking in 08, sober x 10 yrs, retired communications manager\n\n\n\n\t\t\tReview of systems:\n\n   denies ortho/PND/thyroid disease/melena/recent ulcer\n\n\n\nPhysical examination:\n\n\t\t\t\n\n-BMI:   \n\n-Pulse: 85  \n\n-resp. rate: 16  \n\n-height: 67  in.\n\n-weight: 220  \n\n-General:   No acute distress.\n\n-Skin:   No rashes, anicteric.\n\n-Heent:   Unremarkable\n\n-Neck:   JVP flat but difficult to see. - carotids 2+, bilateral bruits R>L\n\n-Chest:   Lungs clear anteriorly\n\n-Cardiac:   He has a normal S1 and S2, and a soft systolic ejection murmur at the left lower sternal border and apex\n\n-Abdomen:   Normal bowel sounds, soft and nontender, with no hepatosplenomegaly or masses appreciated.\n\n-Extremities:   right groin D&I, no hematoma or bruit DP/PT 1+/1+, left groin 2+, no bruit DP/PT 1+/1+\n\n-Neuro:   A&O x3, CN 2-12 grossly intact. \n\n-BP: 139/85   \n\n\n\n\t\t\tEKG:\n\n   75 RBBB -  first degree AVB w PR .22\n\n\n\nSelected recent labs:\n\n\t\t\t Metabolic\n\nDate     K        CL       CO2      BUN      CRE      GLU      CA       \n\n08/09/30 4.8                        46       1.6                        \n\n08/08/30          100      30.9                       263      9.2      \n\n\n\nLiver and Pancreatic Enzymes\n\nDate     ALB      TP       ALKP     TBILI    ALT/SGPT AST/SGOT \n\n07/05/30 4.1                                                   \n\n05/30/30          7.4      93       0.4      22       26       \n\n\n\nHematology\n\nDate     HCT      RBC      WBC      PLT      \n\n08/01/30 33.1     4.14     11.0     221      \n\n\n\nCoagulation\n\nDate     PT       PT-INR   PTT      HCYS/PBH \n\n08/01/30 12.0     1.0                        \n\n01/09/29                   23.3              \n\n07/31/27                            10.9     \n\n\n\nImmunology\n\nDate     HGBA1C   \n\n04/11/30 11.40    \n\n\n\nother\n\nDate     CORT     RENIN    \n\n07/25/30 37.0     8.9      \n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\t\t\tOther Data:\n\n   PFT's 7/26 VC 66%, FEV1/VC 109%\n\n\n\n\t\t\tAssessment and plan:\n\n   77 yo diabetic male admitted after cardiac catheterization for post hydration\n\n\n\nPlan:\n\nAdmit to Internal Medicine\n\nBedrest for 6 hours\n\nResume Lasix tonight - patient has not voided all day, just completing Bicarb drip\n\nFasting lipids, Lipo a, BNP in AM\n\nContinue to hold Ramipril, Aldactone and Diltiazem\n\nComplete Bicarb drip and total of 4 doses of Mucomyst\n\nFollow Renal function\n\nCNIS to evaluate carotid bruits\n\nContinue NPH BID - s/s regular insulin as needed - especially given bicarb qtt in D5W\n\nNutrition consult for HBA1c 11.4, obesity\n\nPer Attending - medical management for now - RCA lesion is long, would be challenging and require significant dye - will increase Imdur to 60 qd\n\nWill need ABX prophylaxis for MR at discharge\n\n\n\nAndreea Marquez RN, MN # 1-3051\n\n\n\nChanges to Medications this visit\n\n\t\t\t\n\nNephrocaps  1 tab  qd\n\nu100 NPH insulin     Start: 08/09/2130\n\nFlonase  1 spray  BID nasally\n\nAtrovent 18 mcg/spray  inh tid Start: 08/09/2130\n\nisosorbide mononitrate 30 mg   qd\n\nToprol XL 100 mg   qd\n\nLipitor 80 mg   QHS\n\nZetia 10 mg   qd\n\nfurosemide 80 mg   qam in the and 80 mg in the qpm Start: 07/13/2130\n\naspirin 325 mg   QD\n\n\n\n\t\t\tSigned electronically by   Andreea  Marquez RN, NP  on  Aug 10, 2130"}

A code was called when bystanders and \n\nmedics reported she was on the floor, diaphoretic and clammy.  The \n\npatient drank something and then proceeded to be taken to the \n\nEmergency Department. \n\nThe patient had a cystoscopy planned for today.  She took her \n\nmedication for her diabetes and presented here with weakness, \n\nnausea, diaphoresis and felt like she may have passed out.  Her \n\nother complaint was mild back pain from passing out.  No epigastric \n\npain or tenderness and no chest pain.  The patient never had any \n\nchest pain prior to her event.  She is followed by the United Medical Center East and their input is pending at this point. \n\nPAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  The patient has a past medical history \n\nsignificant for diabetes, hypertension, hypothyroidism and \n\nmigraines. \n\nMEDICATIONS:  The patient's current medications include Plavix, \n\nCalan slow release and Glucophage. \n\nALLERGIES:  The patient is allergic to intravenous pyelogram dye, \n\nPercocet, penicillin, cephalosporin and lisinopril. \n\nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  HEENT:  Examination is normal.  LUNGS: \n\nClear bilaterally.  CARDIAC:  Regular rate and rhythm with no \n\nmurmurs.  ABDOMEN:  Soft and nontender.  EXTREMITIES:  Normal. \n\nGENERAL:  The patient looks well and has no complaints here. \n\nLABORATORY EVALUATION:  Finger stick in the Emergency Department \n\nwas 160.  Electrocardiogram shows some PR depressions in multiple \n\nleads.  No significant ST elevations. \n\nTHERAPY RENDERED/COURSE IN ED:  Impression is this patient is a 68 \n\nyear old female with planned cystoscopy today who passed out on the \n\npremises.  A code was called overhead.  Bystanders reported that \n\nthe patient was diaphoretic.  They gave her something to drink. \n\nHer blood sugar here was within normal limits.  The patient has no \n\ncomplaints of chest pain or shortness of breath.  She looks well \n\nbut does have PR depressions on electrocardiogram but has no rubs \n\nor gallops on her electrocardiogram.  The patient was made NPO \n\nbecause of her cystoscopy procedure. \n\nFINAL DIAGNOSES: \n\n1.  Syncopal episode versus presyncope from the taking of her \n\ndiabetes medicine this morning. \n\n2.  PR depression on electrocardiogram which appears to be new.  No \n\nold electrocardiogram to compare.  We need to address the PR \n\ndepressions.  This is possibly pericarditis but it is unlikely.  I \n\nwould think that this more likely ischemia than pericarditis. \n\n3.  Cardiac ischemia. \n\nDISPOSITION (including condition upon discharge):  The patient will \n\nneed admission and a formal rule out.  She may even need an \n\nechocardiogram inpatient.  A full work up is pending.  The \n\npatient's full disposition is pending and she was signed out to Dr. \n\nAleta Nunley at 15:00. \n\n___________________________________                    TR682/13484 \n\nGEORGE DUNHAM, M.D.       GD74                           D:08/06/96 \n\n                                                       T:08/06/96 \n\nDictated by:  GEORGE DUNHAM, M.D.       GD74 \n\n ******** Not reviewed by Attending Physician ********\nRecord date: 2102-08-28\n\n\nGibson Internal Medicine Intern Admission Note\n\nPATIENT:  Grace Marvin Yandell\nMRN:  8099832\nADMIT DATE:  8/27/02\nPCP:  unknown\n\nCC:  tx from Mount San Rafael Hospital\n\nHPI:  80F with multiple medical problems including breast ca s/p R. breast lumpectomy, chemotherapy and radiation treatment 30 years ago, recurrent syncope, and seizure disorder who was admitted to San Rafael Mount Hospital following a syncopal event at her neurologist   s office on 7/30/02.

During the same time, the patient reports that she was being weaned off her seizure medications and other medications that might adversely affect her LFTs secondary to LFT elevation on laboratory exams.\n\nAt present, pt. c/o severe(10/10) upper back pain and mid-sternal CP (8/10) that seems fixed to her back pain improved with pain medications and worse with movement.  She reports that she is short of breath all the time and has been coughing a thick mucous.  \n\nHospital Course: \nMRSA Bacteremia:  Blood cultures at San Rafael Hospital grew S. aureus and pt. was started on IV vancomycin.  The bacteremic source remains unclear.  TTE on 8/01/02 showed an EF of 60-65%, no evidence of endocarditis reported.  A TEE on 8/7/02 visualezed all the valves and no vegetations were seen.  Her R. knee was tapped on 8/8/02 and cultures were negative.  A bone scan on 7/7/02 showed a metastatic lesion on MRI in the lower thoracic region  and focal increased uptake in the lateral tibial plateau o f R. knee.\nBack pain: Pt. c/o moderately severe back pain throughout hospital stay at MSRH.  Thoracic spine xrays on 7/31/02 showed osteopenia with no acute fracture or subluxation.  An MRI of thoracic spin (8/02/02) showed a marrow replacing process in the L. T10 pedicle and another smaller lesion at the L. inferior aspect of T11.  The lesion was suspicious for metastatic disease.  No epidural extension was noted.  There was a patent spinal canal and lack of impingement on the thoracic cord.  Pt. received dilaudid 1-3 mg q4hours prn back pain.  As per psych notes, she did not wish to change medications to methadone or fentanyl.  A CT guided bx of the thoracic spine took place on 8/15/02 and was non-diagnostic.  A neurosurgery consult reported that an open bx might destabilize her given the locationo f the pedicle and recommended that the biopsy be done at GCH.    A repeat MRI was done on 8/20/02 due to increasing c/o back pain and showed a 50% compression fx of T4, persitent abnl marrow signal in L. pedicle of T11, and overall heterogenous marrow signal pattern throughout the visualized vertebral bodies.  Immunoelectrophoresis was ordered to r/o myeloma.  \nRight Breast Mass:  A firm R. breast mass was noted at the 7 o/clock position of R. breast at site of lumpectomy scar and the thickening was thought to be 2/2 to previous sx by surgeous at OSH.  A mammogram on 8/5/02 showed innumerable benign appearing calcifications in both breasts.  The R. Breast was significantly smaller and a heterogeneously dense parenchymal pattern was identified.  An u/s of R. breast showed no discrete mass.  A biopsy was delayed 2/2 to bacteremia.  \nRenal failure:  Pt. developed renal failure while on vancomycin with an increase of cr from 1.1 to 2.4.  Her vancomycin level was noted to be >60 on 8/13/02 and vanco was discontinued.  Repeat blood cultures were negative for S. aureus.  \nAnemia: On admission to Rafael Hospital, Hb/Hct: 11.6/35.5.  She was started on procrit by hematology.  She was transfused on unit of PRBCs in the hospital.\nTIA:  Pt. has a hx of TIAs with one episode while hospitalized significant for difficulty with speech and R. hand tingling.  An MRI that day showed new increased signal w/in the ventricles and subarachnoid space noted diffusely.  This finding was likely due to prior IV contrast administration of gadolinium, though an underlying hemorrhage or infection could not be excluded.  A brain MRI on 8/18/02 showed resolution of abnl signal w/in the ventricles, decrease in  high signal in the subarachnoid space, likely representing resolution of sequelae from prior IV gadolinium.  No findings of meningitis but persisting increased signal w/in the L. lope, which may represent vitreal hemorrhage.  \nHTN: Pt. required adjustments in her meciations during her hospital stay to control hypertension.\n\n\nMEDICAL HISTORY\nRecurrent syncope: 2086-2100, 3-4 events per year, last event prior to hospitalization\nSeizure disorder: first sz in 2090s with unresponsive, staring, mouth movements; often occurred in clusters once a year, last sz prior to admission.\nCOPD, asthma\nFrequent UTIs\nElevated LFTs thought to be 2/2 to anti-epileptics\nCAD\nHTN (since adolescence)\nDM adult onset\nHypercholesterolemia\nBreast Ca. s/p R. breast lumpectomy and node removal, chemotherapy, radiation in 2070s\nGERD\nTIAs\nOsteoporosis\nChronic lymphedema and frequent cellulites of RUE s/p node removal for breast ca.\nMRSA bacteremia\nCA stenosis dx 2090s, no surgeries\nHypothyroidism\n\nFAMILY HISTORY non-contributory\n\n\nSOCIAL HISTORY  Widowed for >30years, lives with sister and daughter who provide support and care.\n\nALLERGIES:  PCN (rash, swelling), shellfish (swelling), cephalosporins (swelling), hydromorphone (vomiting), iodine (unknown), percocet (nausea), sulfa (unknown), aspirin (liver problems), codeine (nausea)\n\nMEDICATIONS ON TRANSFER\nDiovan 320 mg PO qday\nDilaudid 1-3 mg IV q4hours\nNorvasc 10 mg PO qday\nVitamin B6 50 mg PO qday\nClonidine TTS-3 one weekly\nZocor 20 mg PO qday\nNiferex 150 mg PO bid\nLasix 20 mg pO qday\nZestril 20 mg PO bid\nNexium 40 mg PO qday\nReglan 10 mg IV q4hours prn n/v\nLabetalol 100 mg PO bid\nPlavix 75 mg qday\nMelatonin 1 mg PO qhs and prn\nHeparin 500 units SC tid\nProcrit 40,000 units qWednesday\nSenokot one tab pO qday\nLevothyroxine ? 0.5mg PO bid\nNTG one inch q6hours, hold if bp<100\nRISS\nKytril 100 mcg q8hrs prn\nErythromycin 250 mg PO bid\nVitamin B12 1000 mcg qam\nFolic acid 1 mg pO qday\nAlbuterol 2 puffs qid and prn\nVancomycin 500 mg IV qday\n\n\nPHYSICAL EXAM\nVITALS:  T 99  HR 96  BP 196/89 (in pain) improved to 156/67  O2 sats: 100% on 2LNC, 96% RA\nHEENT: pinpoint pupils, anicteric sclera, noninfected conjunctiva, no cervical LAD\nCV:S1,S2, rrr, II/VI murmur loudest at aortic area\nPulm: CTA b/l\nBreast exam: R breast significantly smaller than L. breast, no axillary LAD either axilla, \nR. breast with thickening at scar at 7 o   clock, small <1cm round mobile mass palpated between scar and nipple, non-tender, no discharge from nipple\nL. breast non tender, no palpable masses, no discharge from nipples\nAbd: soft, tender to palpation with pain felt at site of touch and in back, no guarding, no rebound, no HSM, +BS\nExt: WWP\nNeuro:  CN II-XII intact, UE strength 4/5 equal b/l at extensors and flexors apparently limited by pain, LE strength 4/5 at extensors/flexors b/l also limited by pain; sensation grossly intact at LE, negative babinski b/l\n\nLABS PENDING\n\nASSESSMENT & PLAN\n80F with multiple medical problems including breast ca s/p R. breast lumpectomy, chemotherapy and radiation treatment 30 years ago, recurrent syncope, and seizure disorder who was admitted to San Rafael Hospital following a syncopal event on 7/30/02.

Her Lipitor had been held as had her Actos due to elevated LFT's, and her Depakote had been discontinued by her neurologist.  Her LFT's had come down from her hospitalization in March but were still elevated at AST 87 and ALT 124.  Liver biopsy was being considered by Dr. Yamasaki, her gastroenterologist.  She also had been recently hospitalized at San Rafael for syncope with history of partial seizure disorder vs TIA with history of transient episodes of right arm numbness and weakness dating to 2098 but with no seizures in 3 yrs.\n\n\n\nIn July O2 she had several episodes of syncope, one of which occured in her neurologist's office.    She was apparently hypotensive and initially refused to go to the ED, but later her family brought her to the ED at San Rafael.  She was found to be bacteremic with MRSA and was treated with IV vancomycin.   Endovascular sources were found to be negative as source, as was a knee tap, and no source was ever identified.  She was transferred to GCH in August.   She had severe back pain and two bone biopsies were negative for osteomyelitis in the spine.  She was also found to have a 50% compression fracture of T4 and this was treated at GCH with a T4 vertebroplasty in September 10.  She also was worked up for mets to spine but only benign hemangiomas were found.\n\n\n\nShe was discharged to rehab in mid September.  She required at least two more admissions from rehab to San Rafael over the next two months.  She apparently had severe gastroparesis and was unable to eat, requiring portacath for TPN around October 10.  She had then gone back to rehab again but was readmitted with DVT of the left Subclavian vein around the site of the Portacath.  She was started on Coumadin and was back in rehab for another few weeks.  The arm swelling quickly resolved. There was also reportedly a TIA which occured after an MRI scan with right facial droop and slurred speech at SRH.  She was finally discharged to home on November 21st.\n\n\n\nMEDS:  Coumadin 7.5 mg qd,  Norvasc 10 mg qd, Isordil 20 mg tid, Neurontin 300 mg po bid, Plavix 75 mg po qd, Prilosec 20 mg qd, Folic aid 1 mg qd, Synthroid 50 mcg qd, Labetolol 200 mg bid, Glipizide 2.5 mg po qd, Albuterol inhaler prn, erytab 250 bid, Ultram 50 mg q 6hrs prn, MVI, Vitamin B12 1000.

Throughout her hospitalization she lost a lot of weight down from 160's to 170's last spring to current level of 135 lbs.  Insulin was stopped and just recently Glipizide 2.5 mg added on.  Recent Hg A1C obtained after this visit on 12/04/02 was 6.0.  Bun /Cr was 11/0.9.  glucose 196.  Cholesterol 225/68/135.  LFT's were not done and need to be done, will be ordered next lab draw.  If normalized then will add back Lipitor.  History of gastroparesis, on new med has replaced Reglan, doing better.\n\n\n\n2)  Hypertension.  Doing well on Norvasc 10, Labetolol 200 bid and Isordil 20 tid.\n\n\n\n3)  S/p recent upper extremity DVT, on coumadin.  Per Dr. Herbert Paris's note of 12/02, she needs 3 months of anticoag, and then 1mg/day until the portacath discontinued.  With history 2 prior DVT's will need to discuss whether she should be on long term therapy.  She is now getting FS INR's thru the VNA, but will be transitioned to Internal Medicine, with access thru the portacath, or continued FS's.  INR has been in good range with 7.5 mg coumadin.\n\n\n\n4)  S/P  compression fracture of T4, s/p vertebroplasty with successful resolution of the pain.  Has other compression fractures but not interested in further procedures at this time.\n\n\n\n5)  History of hypothyroidism.

Followed by Dr. Gary Keyes.    History of silent cerebellar brain infarction on MRI.    History of moderate intracranial carotid stenosis, with recent ? TIA left hemisphere, ? repeat carotid noninvasives per Dr. Keyes vs CT angiogram.  On Plavix and coumadin.  Per Dr. Keyes coumadin alone would be enough for stroke prophylaxis, and he would defer to Dr. Barry as to whether to continue Plavix.\n\n\n\n8)  History of elevated LFT's.  May have been medication related, due to Lipitor, Actos, Depakote.  Now off all meds, need redo as above, and consideration if normal of retrial of  statin.\nRecord date: 2103-07-29\n\n \nInternal Medicine Admission Note\n\nPATIENT: \tGrace Marvin Yandell\nMRN:  \t\t8099832\nADMIT DATE:  7/28/03\nATTENDING:\tWINTERS\nPCP:   \t\tDr. Patricia Mcfarland (MEDIQUIK) 127-319-4834\nCONTACT:  \tDaughter: Penelope Yandell 761-259-5716\nCode status: \tFull\nSource:\t\t\n\nCC:  \nSyncope\n\nHPI: \nMs. Yandell is a delightful 81 year old female with an extensive PMH including HTN, Sz d/o vs TIAs, dyslipidemia, breast cancer, and DVTs who presents following a syncopal episode on the day of admission.\n\nPer a note from her neurologist, Dr. Gary Keyes, Ms. Yandell has a history of transient neurologic events, consisting of right hand numbness and weakness, in 2098 and 2099. She had an extensive workup in which it was unclear whether these represented a transient ischemic attack or partial seizures. She was started on Depakote for this. Between March and April of 2102 her Depakote was weaned because of a lack of interval seizures. EEG in January 2102 showed no evidence of epileptiform activity.   In July 2102 she had several episodes of loss of consciousness which ultimately were diagnosed as syncope. Dr. Keyes witnessed one of these events in his office in 7/02 and it was associated with hypotension.  \n\nMs. Yandell   s family describes her syncopal events differently, stating that she will stare into space for 5-8 minutes, during which time she is unresponsive.  When she    wakes up,    she is confused and sleepy for ~ 20 minutes and will often have nausea and vomiting.  These episodes are associated with jaw-clenching, but no tonic-clonic movements.  Ms. Yandell does state that she feels    dizzy and lightheaded    before these events, and reports that her family says she looks pale and clammy.  She does not recall the events herself.  The family does not report loss of bowel or bladder incontinence, although the patient did apparently lose continence of bowel shortly after being admitted (unclear circumstances surrounding this).  The family reports that EMS checked her blood sugar on the scene     it was normal.\n\nIn the emergency department, Ms. Yandell   s was afebrile,  82  158/70  18   95% on 2L.  She received zofran for nausea, ASA, and IVF, and was transferred up to the floor for further management. \n\nThe patient denies that the episodes occur after she rises from a sitting position.  Do not occur when    bearing down,    or when she is exerting herself.  The episodes are not sudden     she appears to have some warning before one occurs.  She denies fevers/chills.  No chest pain, palpitations.  Some shortness of breath when walking, which sounds like it is unchanged.  Has had a cough for a few months and it is occasionally productive of ?color mucus.  She takes antihypertensive medications, but takes them as directed and by report does not group them together.  \n\n\nPAST MEDICAL HISTORY:\n1. Hypertension\n2.

Appears as though there is diffuse ST segment elevation, although when compared to EKG from >11/02, this appears unchanged.\n\nCXR 7/28: NAD\n\nChest CT 4/03: \nIMPRESSION: Appearance of chest may be at baseline following\n     right mastectomy with radiation therapy effect in right lung\n     apex. Prior histoplasmosis infection could account for all of\n     tiny lung nodules seen.\n\nMRI 9/02\n     Findings:  Diffusion weighted images show no evidence of acute\n     ischemia.  There is susceptibility artifact in the region of the\n     right posterior temporal bone which may be related to prior burr\n     hole or craniotomy.  There are chronic appearing, small right\n     cerebellar infarcts.  There are scattered periventricular FLAIR\n     and T2 hyperintense white matter foci that are most consistent\n     with small vessel ischemic change.  There is FLAIR hyperintensity\n     in this sulci of the bilateral posterior frontal, bilateral\n     parietal and left occipital lobes.  No abnormal enhancement is\n     seen.  The brain parenchyma, ventricles and sulci are otherwise\n     unremarkable.  The major intracranial flow voids are normal.\n     There is a retention cyst in the left maxillary sinus.  There is\n     partial opacification of the right mastoid air cells.  There are\n     bilateral lens implants.  The bones, soft tissues and orbits are\n     otherwise unremarkable.\n     MRA:  There is signal dropout in the P2 segment of the right\n     posterior cerbral artery.  There is diffuse irregularity of the\n     proximal left posterior cerebral artery.  There is moderate\n     stenosis of the left paraclinoid internal carotid artery.  The\n     distal right vertebral artery is not well visualized.  There is\n     otherwise normal flow related enhancement in the major vessels of\n     the circle of Willis.\n     Impression:\n     Flair hyperintensity in the bilateral sulci with a posterior\n     predominance as described.  This could represent hemorrhage, high\n     protein content, high oxygenation or recent previous gadolinium\n     injection.\n     Signal dropout in the right posterior cerebral artery, consistent\n     with severe stenosis with clot not excluded.  Diffuse irregularity\n     of the left posterior cerebral artery.  These findings could be\n     secondary to atheromatous disease in an older patient but\n     vasculitis is another possibility.\n     Moderate stenosis of the left paraclinoid internal carotid artery.\n     No acute ischemia or mass lesion identified.\n     Chronic right cerebellar infarction.\n     Small vessel ischemic changes.\n\nCarotid US 3/02\nIMPRESSIONS:\n1. RIGHT PROXIMAL CCA STENOSIS.\n2. MINIMAL DISEASE OF THE RIGHT CAROTID ARTERY BIFURCATION.\n3. MINIMAL DISEASE OF THE LEFT CAROTID ARTERY BIFURCATION.\n4. BILATERAL ANTEGRADE VERTEBRAL ARTERY FLOW.\n\nEcho    01\n1.  Normal cavity sizes, wall thicknesses and global and regional right\n    ventricular and left ventricular systolic function.  Left ventricular\n    ejection fraction is in the range of 60%.  There is no flattening of the\n    interventricular septum, asymmetric septal hypertrophy or evident right\n    ventricular hypertrophy to suggest any appreciable elevation of pulmonary\n    arterial pressure.  There is a reduced mitral valve diastolic Doppler E/A\n    ratio, which may represent a reduced rate of left ventricular relaxation.\n2.  There is fibrosis of the mitral annulus (very mild) and of the interannular\n    fibrosa between the anterior mitral leaflet and the posterior aortic root.\n    There are also some echodensities within the very proximal aorta which may\n    represent atherosclerotic change. \n3.  The aortic valve is trileaflet.  Cannot fully exclude the possibility of\n    some thickening of the bases of the aortic valve, but, alternatively, the\n    increased echogenicity seen within the proximal aorta may represent\n    atherosclerotic change of the aorta.  There is no evident aortic stenosis\n    or aortic insufficiency.  Very mild mitral annular fibrosis.  Otherwise,\n    the mitral valve appears structurally normal.  Normal appearing tricuspid\n    and pulmonary leaflets.  There are signals of trace mitral regurgitation\n    and trace tricuspid regurgitation.  Flow velocity could not be optimally\n    assessed in the tricuspid regurgitant jet to permit accurate estimation of\n    pulmonary artery systolic pressure.\n4.  There is no evident pericardial effusion.\n\n\n \nASSESSMENT & PLAN:\n\n1)  Syncope : Unclear etiology.  History from family sounds much more like seizure.  Episode in neurologist   s office sounds much more like orthostatic or vasovagal syncope.  Doubt arrhythmia given prodrome.

There was not a significantresponse to inhaled bronchodilator. The reduced FVC is consistent with arestrictive deficit. Suggest lung volumes if clinically indicated. Since6/03/04, the FEV1 and FVC have not changed.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIMPRESSION AND RECOMMENDATIONS: DOE is likely multifactorial. It may be beneficial to separate cardiac from pulmonary limitatio from deconditioning and I recommended a cardio-pulmonary exercise test to the patient, to which she agreed. In addition, as previously discussed, she would benefit from pulmonary rehab. Finally, I am not sure how much asthma is contributing to the picture. There was no response to brnonchodialtor today and the patient does not feel any help from it either. I told her that she does not need to use albuterol if it doesn't help her. I've requested RAST allergy testing to further investigate the possiblity of allergic asthma. We will not do the methacholine challange testing due to patient's already deacreased FEV1 (due to restriction) as it might be dangerous to precipitate bronchoconstriciton in the setting of an already limited reserve.\n\n\nSeen and d/w Dr. Weller\n\n\n\n\n\n\n____________________________________\nXavier U.

During the day yesterday, he went on his daily walk with his wife and felt fine.  In the evening around 8:30 pm, he experienced dull, 8/10 pain under both arm pits which resolved within 20 minutes after taking 3 SL TNG 5 mins apart.  He denies SOB, N/V, radiation or diaphoresis associated with this arm pain.  He states that he gets similar bilateral underarm pain about twice per week which is usually relieved by a single SL TNG within 10-15 mins.  The arm pain is not exertional.\n\n\tAfter the arm pain relieved last night, the pt took 3 Aleve tabs which his daughter bought for him for arthritis pain.  A couple of hours later, he became nauseated and had a single episode of    dark brown    emesis.  After vomiting, he felt light-headed while walking around the house.  He had a bowel movement this AM which he states was darker than usual, almost black looking.  He denies BRBPR, abdominal pain, CP, SOB, palpitations, headache, fever or chills.\n\n\tIn the setting of significant fatigue and light-headedness, the pt presented to the ED this morning.

Per her note, he was admitted with \"complaints of vomiting up food and constant chest pain for 3-4 days. He reports that he has had some troubles with food for the past few months but can't define precisely what the troubles were. It seems that he intermittently vomited or regurgitated both liquids and solids and had a sensation of something getting stuck in his chest. Over the last 3-4 days everything he ate or drank, including water, would come up. He denies nausea. There is no abdominal pain but he describes a constant pain across his chest at the level of his nipples for the past 3-4 days. His pain is currently controlled. He denies pain on swallowing. He does report some weight loss but is unable to identify how much. He denies any new neurologic deficits or headaches.  A barium swallow was obtained which showed a fixed narrowing in the distal esophagus. He has a hx of gastric and duodenal ulcers on endoscopy from 2092 in the setting of NSAID use. He had a normal colonoscopy in 2087.\"\n\n\nDuring that admission. He underwent upper endoscopy that showed severe esophagitis. Two gastric ulcers with clean bases in the \nprepyloric area which were biopsied.  The duodenum was normal. He was discharged on December 15th with HCT 31.3.\n\n\nThe patient now returns with HCT drop to 19 and hypotension. He reports continued difficulty swallowing and some nausea, vomiting. \"Everything comes up.\" He says this has been persistent since his discharge.  He also reports continued black stools since discharge as well. No clear BRBPR. His wife notes one episode of hematemesis yesterday.  No lightheadedness, dizziness, DOE, SOB.  In the ED, hypotensive to 60's / 70's SBP, HCT 19, his ABD CT was negative. INR  pending.

As you\nknow, he recently had a complicated hospital course.  He underwent\ncardiac catheterization, which revealed serial stenoses of the LAD\nincluding 70% and 90% stenoses.  The first marginal branch had a\n60% ostial stenosis.  The right coronary artery had 60 and 80%\nstenoses, respectively.  The PDA had a 70% narrowing.  Given his\nvery significant wish not to have bypass surgery, it was decided to\nproceed with angioplasty of the right coronary artery as well as\nthe obtuse marginal.  It was felt that the LAD was a small vessel,\nand not worth going after at this time.  The RCA was successfully\nstented, but was complicated by occlusion of the posterior left\nventricular branch.  By the end of the procedure, flow had been\nrestored to some degree to the posterior left ventricular branch,\nbut Mr. Potts rule in for a small subendocardial myocardial\ninfarction.  Due to the closure of the left posterior ventricular\nbranch, the obtuse marginal branch was not dilated.  \n \nMr. Potts underwent two exercise tests post procedure. The second\nexercise test was performed with MIBI imaging.  He exercised for\nnine minutes on a submaximal Bruce protocol, and experienced chest\npain.  He had a maximal blood pressure of 148/72 and a heart rate\nof 121.  MIBI images revealed a small nontransmural myocardial\ninfarction of the basal 1/3 of the inferior wall.  There was\nmoderate to severe ischemia of the inferolateral territory in the\nterritory of the RCA.\n \nGiven these findings, it was highly recommended that Mr. Potts\nundergo bypass surgery.  \n \nMr. Potts was discharged on aspirin, Ticlid 250 mg b.i.d.,\nAtorvastatin 20 mg q.h.s., Atenolol 50 mg b.i.d., Imdur 60 mg q.d. \nHe also takes vitamin E and a multivitamin.\n \nOf note is that Mr. Potts has been under quite a bit of stress\nrecently.  His 89-year-old mother has been at Whitehead recovering\nWilliam Potts\nMR#  109-16-75-8              -2-       January 5, 2070\n \nfrom a hip fracture.  He is having difficulty arranging the\nappropriate insurance to cover her medications. \n \nMr. Potts has been experiencing chest pain since discharge.  This\noccurs with increased activity, and is relief with either rest\nand/or 1 nitroglycerin.  He has decreased his work level\nconsiderably, and is relatively sedentary.\n \nOn physical exam, he was well appearing and in no distress.  He had\na blood pressure of 112/70, with a heart rate of 60.  His weight\nwas 203 pounds.  Chest was clear to auscultation and percussion. \nCardiac exam revealed a flat JVP of 30 degrees, a nondisplaced PMI\nwith a normal S1 and S2, without murmurs, rubs, or gallops. \nCarotids are 2+ bilaterally without bruits.   His abdomen is soft,\nnontender.  There is no organomegaly, and no hepatojugular reflux. \nExtremities are without edema.\n \nElectrocardiogram reveals a normal sinus rhythm with a rate of 61. \nIntervals are .16/.08/.42, with an axis of -10 degrees. There are\nflipped T-waves in III and AVF.   I did not have an old\nelectrocardiogram here for comparison.\n \nTherefore, Mr. Potts returns today still experiencing angina with\nmild exertion.  He has agreed to undergo coronary artery bypass\nsurgery.  He has found out that if he is cleared to go back to work\nby his physicians, that the Screen Actor's Guild will make a good case for this. \nThere has been precedent for those who have had bypass surgery to\nreturn to work as an actor.   Given Mr. Potts's current\nfeeling, I will make an appointment with Dr. Earl Jacob as soon\nas possible for him to be seen prior to scheduling bypass surgery.\n \nIt is somewhat worrisome that Mr. Potts will be caring for his 89-\nyear-old mother at home, along with his wife.  His mother currently\nuses a walker, and I have warned Mr. Potts that he really cannot\nexert himself to any great degree in terms of helping his mother in\nthe house.  He understands this, and if his chest pain should\nbecome more frequent, intense, or prolonged, he will immediately\ncall me.  \n \nIf Mr. Potts is not scheduled for surgery, I will see him in two\nweeks at NDNH.  \n \nWith best regards.\n \nSincerely, \n \n \nOlivia Xing, M.D.\nMonmouth Medical Center\n81 Clergy Street\nCasper, NV 33182William Potts\nMR#  109-16-75-8              -3-       January 5, 2070\n \n \nDD: 01/05/70\nDT: 01/06/70\nDV: 01/05/70\n \ncc:\nEarl Jacob, M.D.\nCardiac Surgery\nLaurel Regional Hospital\n96 Clergy Street\nCasper, NV 33182 \n \n ******** Approved but not reviewed by Attending Provider ********\nRecord date: 2073-09-28\n\n59 y/o male for f/u:\n\n   1) BP - No CP, SOB, pedal edema\n\n   2) low HDL - walking daily\n\n   3) ED - Viagra working well at 50 mg \n\n   4) hi LDL - continues Lipitor w/o muscle pain\n\n\n\nO/E Looks well.

He has peripheral vascular disease with a prior left femoral-tibial bypass graft.  He initially presented to the vascular surgery clinic with an ischemic ulceration in the right foot. There were no lesions amenable to percutaneous intervention and he underwent right common femoral artery to distal anterior tibial artery in situ saphenous vein bypass graft on 6/01/78. He was discharged to an acute rehabilitation facility on 6/07 where he reports initially doing well. The patient was readmitted in early June because of fevers.  No source of the fevers were determined but he was started on an empiric regimen of antibiotics.  During that admission, every other staple in his wound was removed.  The patient came back to clinic where all of his sutures were removed.  The surgical site over the lower leg never completely healed and the open area was treated with daily dressing changes.  He was seen in clinic for follow-up today where his wound was again noted to be open in proximity to the graft.  Plastic surgery is consulted regarding closure options.\n\nPMH/PSH:  \t1. CAD\n2.

On the right lower extremity, there is an incision from the groin to the foot.  It is well-healed with the exception of a 5 x 2 cm area over the lower third of the leg just medial to the tibia.  The graft is palpable just lateral to the area.  The base of the wound appears to have granulation tissue.  No odor.  There is minimal erythema and tenderness around the site.  Distal pulses palpable. Foot warm and well-perfused but with no sensation below the ankle.  There are other venous stasis ulcers in various stages of healing.  The great toe has an ulcer with overlying eschar.\n\nRelevant Laboratory Values:\nPending\n\nAssessment: 85 yo WM w/ multiple medical comorbidities presents with need for wound coverage of a right saphenous vein bypass graft.  This may be amenable to local flap coverage.\n\nRecommendations: \n-Tentative plan wound debridement/possible flap closure this week\n-Will discuss with Dr. Ring (covering for Dr. Velasco) and plan to assist with closure.\n-Preoperative labs and studies pending.\n-Continue daily dressing changes for now.\n\nThe patient was discussed with Dr. Uriah Wills.\n\nJames Kopp, M.D.\nPH  Surgery, Pager #: 79920\nRecord date: 2078-09-06\n\n\nVascular Surgery H&P\nDate 09/06/78\n\nName:  Richard, Ulysses\nMedical Record: 8913196\nAttending:  Snyder\n\nHistory of Present Illness:  Mr Ulysses is an 85 yom with h/p PVD s/p multiple bilateral lower extremity revascularizations and a non-healing wound on the RLE.  Most recently, he had undergone Rle necrotic ulcer debridement (07/78),R CFA to distal anterior tibial BPG on 05/78.  The wound was overlying the BPG.  He was made NWB on R, with VAC dressing applied to the wound to be changed twice weekly.  He has been followed in clinic.  Though he was noted to have good granulation tissue during his hospitalization one month ago, recently his wound has been concerning for non-healing.  In clinic, his RLE is ischemic, and there is a concern for wound infection.\nThe patient reports that the proximal aspect of his wound had pregressive breakdown over the past 2-3 weeks, with associated increase in pain, especially with VAC changes.  He says that he could no longer feel a palpable graft pulse as he could just after the surgery.  His foot became increasingly discolored, and his toe became necrotic after some minor trauma without response to silvadene.\nNo fevers, chills, nausea, vomiting.\n\nPast Medical History:\nCAD, Htn, CRI (Cr 1.8 at baseline), DM, PVD, Carotid Stenosis s/p R CEA 3/73, CHF, AF, Nephrolithiasis, Spinal Stenosis\n\nPast Surgical History: \nRLE wound debridement 2078\nR CFA to distal anterior tibial in-situ saphenous BPG 2078\nL fem/pop/peroneal BPG redo 2074\nL fem/pop BPG 2073\nR CEA\n\nAllergies:\nASA   GI intolerance\n\nMedications:  \nLasix 40 po qd\nIpatropium inh\nNorvasc 10 bid\nKCL 20 QD\nZocor 20 mg po qhs\nFentanyl patch\nDoxazosin 2mg po qhs\nNitroglycerine patch 0.2mg/h\nLopressor 12.5 po bid\nNexium 40 mg po qd\nLexapro 10 mg po qd\nASA 325 mg po qd\nGlyburide 5mg po qd\nPercocet prn\nAtivan 0.5 mg po bid prn\n\nSocial history:  Denies tobacco use in past or currently.

She was en route to her normal dialysis session, and EMT took BP that was 80s/40s, brought to LCH ED for evaluation. Notably recently admitted to Santa Rosa on 9/10/2098 for hematemesis/hematochezia, but no intervention done. No report of recent GI bleeding. \n\n\n\nIn ED, initial BP in 80s/30s, got 1.5 liters of IV fluid, came up to 90s/50s. Also was on 4-5 liters of oxygen with sat 95%. Blood and urine cultures sent, Vancomycin and Cefepime given. Daughter was contacted, who states patient is definitely DNR/DNI and no invasive interventions are to be done (including central lines, surgery, etc.) Bedside ultrasounds revealed known pleural effusions, pericardial effusion without signs of tamponade, and hypoechoic material in bladder suspicious for abscess/infection. CT abdomen done, was notable for bladder wall thickening potentially c/w cystitis, a new moderate sized pericardial effusion, and rectal wall thickening c/w proctitis. After CT, Foley placed with reported return of 400-500 cc of frank pus.

Since her discharge from the hospital in September,\nshe has noticed that she is fatigue with exertion but has had no\nchest pressure and no exertional diaphoresis, nausea, or jaw pain. \nShe does note occasional lightheadedness throughout the day, this\nis not related to position or going from sitting to standing\nposition.  As you are aware, her MIBI test showed very small amount\nof ischemia almost undetectable in amount.  \n \nHer medical regimen includes Lasix 40 mg po q.d., Lisinopril 20 mg\npo q.d., 125 mg of hydrochlorothiazide b.i.d.  Of note, she was\ntaking an additional Lisinopril at 20 mg po b.i.d.  Labetalol 200\nmg b.i.d., Isordil 40 t.i.d., Prilosec 20 mg po q.d., Cisapride 10\nmg po q.d., simvastatin 10 mg po q.d., aspirin 325 mg po q.d.\n \nOn physical exam, her blood pressure is 140/90 right and left arm\nseated, heart rate is 77 and irregular, respiratory rate is 12. \nThere is no increase in jugular venous pressure.  Carotids are free\nof bruits.  Lungs are clear to auscultation throughout.  Cardiac\nexam is notable for distant heart sounds with no S3, S4.  Abdomen\nis soft and nontender.  The extremities are free of edema.  \n \nElectrocardiogram is normal sinus rhythm with left bundle branch\nblock unchanged from prior electrocardiograms.\n \nIn summary, Shilpa Pickett certainly has cardiovascular risk\nfactors of sedentary lifestyle, diabetes, high cholesterol and\nincrease in weight.  We will be rechecking her lipid profile today. \nShe reports to me that she has absolutely no appetite for the foods\nshe usually eats and has occasionally had trouble eating.  She\nnotes no dysphoria and no other signs or symptoms of depression. \nShe has had no change in her hair or skin.

She had the flu in January \nand then developed another upper respiratory tract infection a couple of \nweeks ago.  She states that this has severely debilitated her.  She is \ncomplaining of occasional nonproductive cough, post nasal drip, and \noccasional dull headache.  However, her main concern is her stomach and \nher back.  Ms. Pickett continues to have postprandial nausea and discomfort \nin her epigastrium, particularly after eating.  This is different than her \nreflux disease, which she feels is under fairly good control, with the \nPrilosec-Propulsid combination.  She is describing some anorexia, although \nshe has not lost any weight.  She has not had any alterations in her bowel \nmovements.  She has not been constipated or had diarrhea.  She wonders \nwhether this could be in gallbladder.  In addition, she is continuing to \nhave some back pain with radiation down her left leg in the L5/S1 \ndistribution.  She had one epidural steroid injection but was due to go \nback.  Given her upper respiratory tract infection, this was postponed.  \n \nShe is not having any heart symptoms or shortness of breath.  Her sugars \nhave been under good control, ranging between 111 and 143.  Her blood \npressure is 152/70 today, with a pulse of 70.  She is saturating well.\n \nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  On physical exam, lungs were clear to auscultation.  \nThere was no JVD.  Heart: regular rate and rhythm with positive S4, ? S3 \nwith no significant murmur.  Abdomen was soft, nondistended, with some \nmild tenderness without rebound or guarding over the right upper quadrant.  \nAbdomen was somewhat bloated per patient and diffusely tender.  \nExtremities revealed some mild pedal edema left greater than right.  \n \nASSESSMENT AND PLAN:  A seventy-one-year-old woman with multiple medical \nissues, including coronary artery disease, CHF, diabetes, hypertension, \nand cerebrovascular disease.  She came in today for discussion of her \nongoing lumbar radiculopathic pain as well as her abdominal complaint.\n \nWith regard to her back pain, she wanted a prescription for Tylenol with \ncodeine, which has helped in the past.  I gave her a prescription.  I \nwarned her about the possible side effects of constipation.  She should \ncontact the pain clinic as soon as she feels able, for a repeat epidural \nsteroid injection.\n \nWith regard to her abdominal complaints, the bubbling in her chest, \npostprandial nausea and anorexia could certainly be due to gallbladder \ndisease.

I confirmed her history and\n\nphysical.  I also interviewed and examined the patient.  Please\n\nsee her note for more details.\n\nHISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 77-year-old female with a\n\nseveral-week history of nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, which\n\nhas worsened over the past 3 days, per the patient and her son. \n\nThese episodes are \"gassy feeling\" in the epigastrium associated\n\nwith nausea and vomiting and lightheadedness.  No chest pain, no\n\nshortness of breath.  Of note, the patient has a history of\n\ncoronary artery disease with atypical symptoms.  She has also had\n\na history of pancreatitis.\n\nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  She is awake and alert, in no distress at\n\nthis time.  Afebrile with a pulse of 62, blood pressure 140/60,\n\nand O2 sat 100% on room air.  Neck is supple with no signs of\n\nmeningismus.  Head is atraumatic.  Moist mucous membranes.  Lungs\n\nare clear to auscultation bilaterally.  Heart has regular rate\n\nand rhythm.  Abdomen is soft with mild epigastric tenderness to\n\npalpation.  No guarding or rebound on my exam.  Extremities are\n\nwarm and well perfused.\n\nEMERGENCY DEPARTMENT COURSE:  The patient's IV access was\n\nestablished.  Labs were drawn revealing white count of 8,\n\nhematocrit of 39.  BUN and creatinine of 36 and 1.5, which is\n\nnormal for the patient.  LFTs are normal.  Lipase is slightly\n\nelevated at 67.  Troponin less than assay.  Urinalysis 25-30\n\nwhite cells.  The patient's EKG was left bundle-branch block,\n\nwhich is unchanged.  KUB shows no air fluid levels.  This patient\n\nhas a possible mild pancreatitis as well as a mild urinary tract\n\ninfection.  In addition, she has multiple cardiac risk factors\n\nand an EKG, which will not allow for conventional cardiac stress\n\ntesting.\n\nShe will be admitted the hospital for enzymatic rule out MI with\n\na possible necessity to have a stress MIBI as well as to give IV\n\nantibiotics for urinary tract infection and hydration and serial\n\nexams for her probable pancreatitis.

She has no known prior manifestations of coronary disease, but has a long history of insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus and hypertension.  She had been in her usual state of health until about 2 weeks ago, when she began to have episodes of chest discomfort.  She has only had two such episodes until the morning of admission, when she developed severe episode of chest pain at rest associated with shortness of breath.  She presented to the emergency room here where she was found to have new-onset ST-segment elevation in the inferior leads with a coving morphology involving the lateral leads as well.  There was also poor R-wave progression V1 through V3.  She was taken urgently to the cardiac catheterization laboratory, where she was found to have a markedly elevated wedge pressure at 30 mmHg with a normal cardiac index and blood pressure.  She had mid inferior wall and lateral wall akinesis initially with 3+ mitral regurgitation.  There was severe diffuse coronary disease with diffuse LAD disease and total occlusion of the proximal circumflex.  The right coronary artery was small with a 70% proximal stenosis.  The occluded circumflex was crossed with a wire and was stented with a Cypher drug-eluting stent.  She had an excellent result with the wedge also decreasing to 20 mmHg.  She had an estimated 70% ejection fraction despite the inferior and lateral akinesis.  Cardiac index was 2.5 with SVR of 1739.  She was then brought to the coronary care unit for further evaluation.\n\nHer past medical history is notable for hypertension for which she takes lisinopril 40 mg q.d. and atenolol 50 mg q.d.  She also has insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus and takes insulin.  Past medical history is also notable for a hysterectomy.\n\nSocial history is notable for no cigarette or alcohol use.  She is from Paraguay and has recently arrived in this country.\n\nReview of systems show no fever, chills, nausea, or vomiting.\n\nOn exam, she is comfortable with a blood pressure initially 160/80 with a heart rate of 70 and regular.  Followup pressure 125/80 with a heart rate of 72 beats per minute.  Head and neck were unremarkable.  Chest is clear.  Cardiac exam shows no jugular venous distention at 30 degrees.  PMI is normal.  S1 and S2 were normal with a physiological split.  There is an S4 and a 1/6 systolic ejection murmur as well as a 1 to 2/6 holosystolic murmur and mitral regurgitation at the left lower sternal border.  There is no S3.  Abdominal exam was unremarkable without organomegaly.  Bowel sounds are normal.  Extremities showed no edema or cyanosis.  Calf site is clean without bruits.  Distal pulse is decreased but palpable.\n\nHer resting 12-lead electrocardiogram shows evidence of her evolving inferolateral MI.\n\nOther lab values included creatinine 1.0 with normal electrolytes, hematocrit is 44.4%, white blood cell count 3.8 with platelets 322,000.  Liver function tests are normal.\n\nA portable chest x-ray shows pulmonary edema.\n\nMrs. Sergio-Steven clearly has evidence of an inferoposterior MI initially with a very high filling pressure and pulmonary edema and mitral regurgitation.  She has had her circumflex, which is a very large vessel, well treated now with a drug-eluting stent, and her wedge has come down, and her mitral regurgitation is substantially improved.\n\nAt this point, we will bring her to the coronary care unit for careful management with aspirin, Plavix, heparin, continue the Integrilin, as well as Lasix and nitrates.  We will plan to initiate afterload reduction as soon as tolerated, and also plan beta-blockade to limit her myocardial oxygen demands.  She certainly has co-existent quite substantial coronary disease including primarily the right coronary artery degree and to some degree the LAD.  At this point, if she were to have developed recurrent ischemia, we would proceed to consideration of bypass surgery.\n\n\n\n\n\n______________________________\nYakov Ferris, MD\n\n\nDictated By: Yakov Ferris\n\n\neScription document:5-4672574 BFFocus\n\n\n\nDD: 09/03/74\nDT: 09/03/74\nDV: 09/03/74\nRecord date: 2074-12-09\n\nFrancesca is a 72 y/o woman here for f/u abnormal lab tests done 11/21.

Resident's note was reviewed.  The patient was seen and\n\nexamined by me.\n\nHISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Briefly, this is a 73-year-old woman\n\nwith extensive cardiac history of hypertension and coronary\n\nartery disease, IMI with any EF 40%, history of V-TACH, high\n\ncholesterol, insulin-dependent diabetes, and status post AICD\n\ncardiac catheterization and in the past.  The patient was in the\n\nEmergency Department today visiting a family member.  She was\n\ncompletely asymptomatic, but had her blood pressure taken which\n\nshowed a pressure of 190/98.  The patient states that she usually\n\ntakes 9 cardiac and antihypertensive medicines but the\n\nprescriptions has run out and so for the past week or so, she has\n\nbeen taking only 4 of the 9.  She is unable to say exactly which\n\nones.  She denies any headache, visual changes, chest pain,\n\nshortness of breath, palpitations, dizziness, or lightheadedness.\n\n Her husband is the one in the Emergency Department today and\n\nthat is causing her some stress.  Denies any rash, joint pain,\n\nback pain, polyuria, or polydipsia.\n\nPlease see the resident's note for details of the patient's past\n\nmedical history, surgical history, family history, review of\n\nsystems, and physical exam.\n\nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  She is awake, alert, in no distress with\n\nno complaints.  Has a repeat blood pressure of 190/95 and\n\nsaturating 99% on room air with a pulse of 70.  Exam is\n\nremarkable for a systolic ejection murmur at the right upper\n\nsternal border of 3/6.  No JVD, with good and equal pulses. \n\nAbdomen is soft and nontender.  She has no papilledema and fundal\n\nexam is clear.  Neurologically, she is oriented x3 with normal\n\nmood and affect.\n\nIMAGING STUDIES:  EKG shows first-degree AV block with an old\n\nLAD.  This is considered normal for this patient and is unchanged\n\nfrom before.  Urinary dip is negative.\n\nEMERGENCY DEPARTMENT COURSE:  The patient's usual pharmacy is\n\ncontacted.  Correct doses of her medications are obtained and\n\nrefills for 2 weeks were given.  She is told to follow up with\n\nher primary care physician within 2 weeks.  She says she will be\n\nable to do that and remains asymptomatic throughout her Emergency\n\nDepartment stay.  At one point during her stay, her blood\n\npressure went up to as high as 209/98, however, on my last\n\nrecheck, just prior to the patient leaving, the pressure was\n\n185/90.  The patient's primary care physician was contacted about\n\nthis and agrees to follow up with the patient within 3 days.\n\nDISPOSITION:  The patient is discharged home in satisfactory\n\ncondition.\n\n ******** Not reviewed by Attending Physician ********\n\nPRIMARY DIAGNOSIS:  Hypertension.\n\n______________________________\n\nVARNER, FALLON M.D.\n\nD: 07/03/75\n\nT: 07/03/75\n\nDictated By: VARNER, FALLON\n\neScription document:1-0201766 BF\nRecord date: 2076-06-22\n\n\n\nReason for Visit\n\n   Francesca is a 74 y/o woman here for evaluation of HTN,cardiac and DM treatment. \n\n\n\n\n\nProblems\n\n      DM\n\n      HTN\n\n      Hysterectomy\n\n      Coronary artery disease    : CABG-9/74\n\n\n\nMedications\n\n      Ntg 1/150 (NITROGLYCERIN 1/150 (0.4 Mg))   1 TAB SL x1 \n\n      Asa (ACETYLSALICYLIC Acid)   81MG TABLET take 1 Tablet(s) PO QD \n\n      Humulin N   UNITS  SC QAM and before bed , 20 units AM, 30 units HS\n\n      FUROSEMIDE   80 MG (80MG TABLET take 1) PO BID \n\n      CAPTOPRIL   25MG TABLET  PO TID x 30 days\n\n      Lipitor (ATORVASTATIN)   20 MG (20MG TABLET take 1) PO QHS \n\n      Plavix (CLOPIDOGREL)   75 MG (75MG TABLET take 1) PO QD x 14 days\n\n      Toprol Xl (METOPROLOL Succinate Extended Release)   100MG TAB.SR 24H  PO QD x 14 days\n\n\n\nAllergies\n\n      NKA\n\n\n\nNarrative History\n\nTakes meds.

She has stable symptoms, nothing to suggest an ACS, but she's dyspneic with exertion and takes nitro occasionally.\n\n\n\nMedications:  Atenolol 100 mg qd, Aspirin 81 mg. qd, Imdur 30 mg., Lipitor 20 mg qd, glucophage\n\n\n\nPhysical examination:  Reveals her to be obese weighing 231 lbs.  Her BP is 120/ palp in her left arm and her heart rate is 80. Her lungs are clear throughout.  Her apical impulse is non-displaced with a regular rate and rhythm, a normal S1 and S2, but no S3 or S4.  There is a grade 1 MR murmur noted.  There is no jugular venous distention and carotid pulses are 2+ bilaterally with soft bilateral bruits.  Her abdomen is morbidly obese.  Her extremities are notable for trace lower extremity edema.\n\n\n\nEKG:  NSR with an old IPMI.  She also has non specific STT wave abnormalities.  When compared to a previous tracing there is no change. \n\n\n\nImpression:\n\n\n\n1.CAD, s/p cath and stenting:  her angina is clearly related to her weight going up again; I worry about this, and wonder if she should have another weight loss surgery.  For the meantime, I will increase Imdur to 60 mg qd, and consider an increase in atenolol.\n\n\t\n\nUmberto M. Uzzell, MD pager #12472\n\n\t\n\nSigned electronically by  Umberto M. Uzzell, MD\n\nDocument Status: Final\nRecord date: 2089-04-05\n\n\n\tCARDIOLOGY\n\t\n\n\tSAINT VINCENT HOSPITAL\n\t\n\n\n\tInterval History:\n   Ursula is seen in the Cardiology office for a followup visit.  Since last seen, she notes a number of somewhat concerning symptoms.  First of all, she is noting some mid sternal chest discomfort with exertion.  She associates this with back pain related to a remote back injury, but nonetheless with exertions she develops some degree of mid sternal chest discomfort, non radiating, associated may be with some shortness of breath.  She has not used any nitroglycerin for it.  It gets better when she rests.  She denies palpitations, PND, or orthopnea.  Her sugars are out of control.  Her weight is down, nonetheless.\n\nPhysical examination:\n\t\n-Pulse:   80\n-BP: 130/85  \n-weight:   206 lbs.\n-General:   Overweight.  Well appearing.\n-Skin:   No rashes.  Anicteric.\n-Heent:   Unremarkable.\n-Neck:   JVP less than 5, possible venous hums bilaterally.  Carotids without bruits.\n-Chest:   Clear to auscultation and percussion.\n-Cardiac:   Apical impulse nondisplaced and discrete.  Regular rate and rhythm.  Normal S1 and split S2.  Soft S4 gallop.\n-Abdomen:   Obese, soft, nontender, and nondistended without hepatosplenomegaly, bruits, dilated aorta.\n-Extremities:   No clubbing, cyanosis, or edema.\n\nProcedures:\n\t\nElectrocardiogram  normal sinus rhythm IVCD, old IMI.  In addition, she has nonspecific ST and T-wave changes.  Compared there is no important change.\n\n\n\tImpression:\n   1.  Coronary artery disease status post multiple PCIs.  Ursula has the return of chest symptoms which are suggestive for angina.  I will refer her for an exercise tolerance test to better evaluate this.  I will continue on the current medication program.\n2.  Hypertension.  Her blood pressure is a bit elevated.  Given her diabetes, I think it is prudent to add an ACE inhibitor.  Accordingly, lisinopril 2.5 mg QD was added to her program.\n3.  Lipids will be checked.  I strongly suspect that her LDL is not well suppressed.  Our goal LDL in this case is less than 70 mg/dL.\n\n\t\nUmberto Uzzell, MD\n\n\t\nSigned electronically by  Umberto Uzzell, MD\nDocument Status: Final"}

As her history is well known to you, I will repeat it\n\nbriefly for our records.  Mrs. Vance is a 47-year-old woman with\n\na history of variegata porphyria, insulin dependent diabetes and\n\nsignificant coronary artery disease.  In 2061, after a four to five\n\nday history of retrosternal chest discomfort, she was admitted to\n\nthe Barton Memorial Hospital where coronary angiography\n\nrevealed a 95% proximal left anterior descending artery stenosis. \n\nShe underwent balloon angioplasty of her LAD times two with\n\ninadequate results.  She therefore was taken electively for\n\ncoronary artery bypass graft surgery with placement of a left\n\ninternal mammary artery to her LAD.  She subsequently continued to\n\nhave chest discomfort and underwent repeat cardiac catheterization\n\nin May of 2063 at which time coronary angiography revealed a 60%\n\nstenosis in the proximal left anterior descending artery and a 50%\n\nstenosis in the mid right coronary artery.  The catheterization\n\nreport does not indicate the status of her left internal mammary\n\nartery graft.  Since then, she has continued to have episodes of\n\nintermittent abdominal discomfort.  She recently has undergone an\n\nextensive evaluation by the gastroenterology service for her\n\nabdominal pain without specific pathology being discovered.  Trials\n\nof H2 blockers and proton pump inhibitors have been ineffective. \n\nIn November of 2068, she underwent a Bruce protocol stress test\n\nexercising for eight minutes to a peak heart rate of 131, peak\n\nblood pressure of 188/82 stopping because of fatigue.  She had no\n\nischemic changes on electrocardiogram.  Over the past two weeks\n\nhowever, she has noticed that her chronic abdominal pain syndrome\n\n(which she often describes as feeling like indigestion) now\n\nincludes radiation to her left shoulder.  The pain is not\n\nexacerbated by position, time of day or any particular activity. \n\nThe pain does not awaken her from sleep nor does it occur at rest. \n\nOf note, her lipid profile from October 2068 indicates a\n\ncholesterol of 229, triglyceride of 68, HDL 51, LDL of 164.

In light of her significant dyslipidemia and insulin\n\ndependent diabetes, I strongly recommend beginning aggressive\n\nantilipemic pharmacologic therapy.  Unless her variegata porphyria\n\nprecludes the use of atorvastatin, I would begin this at 10 mg po\n\nq.d.  I would target her LDL cholesterol to less than 90.

Koontz, M.D.\nInternal Medicine Associates\nBarton Memorial Hospital\n70 Batchelder Street\nMinerva, TN  41694\n\n\nDear Wanda:\n\nMr. Vance returns for followup.  Since last seen, she apparently was recently seen in the walk-in clinic in your office complaining of profound fatigue and depression.  She wonders if she was having a flare of her porphyria.  Apparently, her examination at that time was relatively benign, and no specific new findings were noted.  After talking with Dr. Vogt at that office visit, she felt modestly improved, and over the past few weeks feels that her energy level has returned to its baseline.  Lab studies obtained at that time revealed creatinine 0.9, glucose elevated at 236, hematocrit of 43, with a white count 10.  As no specific pathology was noted, she was sent home without any change in her medical regimen.\n\nCurrently, she continues on Lantus insulin 20 units subcutaneous. q.p.m., Celexa 40 mg p.o. q.d., enteric-coated aspirin 81 mg p.o. q.d., Flonase 1-2 puffs p.o. q.d., isosorbide mononitrate 60 mg p.o. q.d., Neurontin 600 mg p.o. t.i.d., nitroglycerin p.r.n. which she has not had to take, lisinopril 10 mg p.o. q.d., furosemide 20 mg p.o. q.d., and p.r.n. Motrin.\n\nPhysical exam reveals a thin woman in no acute distress.  Blood pressure right arm sitting 105/78, heart rate 70 and regular, respirations 14 and unlabored, and weight is pending.  The neck is supple.  JVP is flat.  Carotids are 2+ with very soft bilateral referred murmurs.  Chest is clear.  Cardiac exam shows normal S1, physiologically split S2 with 1/6 systolic ejection murmur radiating from the apex to the base, and a 1-2/6 holosystolic murmur radiating from the apex to the axilla.  No significant diastolic murmur or rub.  The abdomen is benign.  Extremities reveal trace bipedal edema.  Peripheral pulses are diminished but detectable.\n\nElectrocardiogram is pending.\n\nImpression:  Ms. Vance remains relatively stable from a cardiovascular perspective.  However, as you know, her last echocardiogram did show evidence of at least moderate mitral regurgitation with significantly reduced left ventricular systolic function.  She has made it quite clear that under no circumstances would she consider repeat cardiac surgery to treat her valvular heart disease.  Nonetheless, I think it would be helpful for her to undergo repeat echocardiogram to help gauge the current status of her left ventricle and degree of regurgitation, which may allow for additional modifications to her therapeutic regimen.  Beyond this, her condition is actually relatively stable from a cardiovascular standpoint.  I have not further altered her medical regimen.\n\nThank you very much for allowing me to assist in her care.\n\nSincerely yours,\n\n\n\n\n\n______________________________\nTimothy Quarterman, M.D.\n\n\nDictated By: Timothy Quarterman\n\n\neScription document:6-0437424 GFFocus\n\n\nCC: John Koontz MD\n489 MONICA STREET\nMINERVA, TN 41694\n\nDD: 05/10/73\nDT: 05/11/73\nDV: 05/10/73"}

It has been nearly 18 months since his last visit here and in the interim time, has been having discomfort involving both of his hips, thighs, and calves.  As you well know, Mr. Mullen is a delightful 69-year-old gentleman with history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, coronary artery disease, type 2 diabetes mellitus, and peripheral arterial disease who previously underwent left common femoral and left popliteal artery revascularization November 2088 followed by right external, right internal, and right common femoral artery revascularization in February 2089.  Despite the technical success of both procedures, he continued to have bilateral hip claudication symptoms.  When we had last evaluated him in November 2089, we had considered moving forward with CT angiography to assess the patency of his aorto-iliac anatomy.  At the time, he favored moving on a conservative course with improved walking regimen and weight loss.  Unfortunately, despite these measures, he feels quite disabled and limited by his claudication symptoms.  Symptoms are noticeable between 20 and 50 yards distance occurring in the hip area as well as extending down in to his thigh and occasionally the calves.  Symptoms resolve with sitting and resting for approximately 2.5 minutes.  He notes that symptoms will improve with standing still however sitting symptoms resolve much quicker.  He does not necessarily notice any change with inclines or going up stairs; in fact, he is actually able to climb 18 stairs to his office without limitation.\n\n\n\nFrom the cardiac perspective, Mr. Mullen has been free of any symptoms of exertional chest tightness, pressure, or shortness of breath.  We understand that you are following him in closely in this regard and now requesting up coming chemical stress test given that has been nearly 10 years from his coronary artery bypass surgery.\n\n\n\n\tPast medical history:\n\n   Hypertension.\n\nHyperlipidemia.\n\nCAD.\n\nPAD.\n\nPrior tobacco use.\n\nObesity.\n\nType 2 diabetes mellitus.\n\nDepressive disorder.\n\nCervical spine disease.\n\nCongenital hypospadias.\n\nProstatitis.\n\nHemorrhoids.\n\nColonic polyps.\n\nChronic normocytic anemia.\n\n\n\n\tMedications (Confirmed):\n\n\t\n\naspirin  325 mg qd\n\nAtacand  15 mg qd\n\ndoxepin \n\nglyburide \n\nLipitor  80 mg qd\n\nLopid  600 mg BID\n\nToprol XL  50 mg qd\n\nWellbutrin \n\n\n\nPhysical examination:\n\n\t\n\n-Pulse:   66 and regular\n\n-General:   Mr. Mullen is well appearing in no apparent distress\n\n-Heent:   Benign\n\n-Neck:   Carotids are 2+ without bruits\n\n-Chest:   Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally without any wheezes, rhonchi, or rubs\n\n-Cardiac:   Discloses regular rhythm with a rate of approximately 66 beats per minute.

Interestingly, he has had these symptoms dating back to immediately following his revascularization procedures in 2088 and 2089.  On examination today, his femoral pulses are certainly not robust and may suggest the presence of restenosis.  We discussed with Mr. Mullen the potential of going forward with lower extremity noninvasive studies; however, these revealed supra-normal ABIs in the past secondary to his diabetes.  Likewise, we discussed the possibility of moving forward with a non-invasive imaging study i.e. CT angiogram; however, this would not provide the option of therapeutic intervention if indeed narrowings were noted.  Accordingly, Mr. Mullen is in favor of proceeding forward with diagnostic peripheral angiography plus/minus therapeutic intervention if restenosis of his aortoiliac segments are noted.\n\n\n\nIt is indeed possible that there is a contributing factor of spinal stenosis in that Mr. Mullen's symptoms are relieved more quickly in the sitting position.  Likewise, he has noted improvement upon leaning forward and against a tree.  We understand that Mr. Mullen is being considered for an upcoming chemical stress test to assess the patency for any silent coronary ischemia.  He is quite reticent to go forward with the chemical stress test though we did broach the subject of performing coronary catheterization at the time of his peripheral angiogram given that we are actually going to be in there.  He has actually requested this as opposed to going forward with the chemical stress test.  With your permission, we will perform both coronary catheterization to assess the patency of his grafts in addition to his peripheral angiogram plus/minus therapeutic intervention of his lower extremities.\n\n\n\nParamount to his ongoing cardiovascular fitness, we certainly recommend blood pressure of 130/80 or below and LDL cholesterol 70 or below and ongoing exercise and weight loss.  We will plan to schedule his procedure in the upcoming weeks and he is to notify us if symptoms are progressed in the interim time.\n\n\n\nChanges to Medications this visit\n\n\t\n\nglyburide    \n\nToprol XL 50 mg   qd\n\nAtacand 15 mg   qd\n\nLipitor 80 mg   qd\n\nLopid 600 mg   BID\n\naspirin 325 mg   qd\n\nWellbutrin    \n\ndoxepin    \n\n\n\nThank you for allowing us to participate in his care.

I personally performed a comprehensive cardiovascular examination, including assessment of VS; auscultation of carotid arteries, lungs, heart, and abdomen; palpation of carotid arteries, evaluation of jugular venous pressure, palpation of abdominal aorta and lower extremity pulses and perfusion, and neurologic examination for focal deficits.

I permanently follow him for PAD, as I know he follows with Dr. Fernandes for his coronary disease.\n\nRegarding his peripheral disease, he is status post left common femoral endarterectomy, performed at my request by Dr. Fredrick Xa couple of years ago.  This alleviated some of his left leg claudication, though he still has some residual symptoms in that left calf.  The right calf is what bothers him more, with symptoms that are earlier in onset.  They occurred about 100 yards of walking on the flat.  While Chris is affected by this, it does not preclude him from doing his usual activities of daily living.  He also continues to travel (on his way to Bogalusa with Brad Fair, his partner, next week), and also continues to work actively.  The biggest problem with his claudication is that it prevents him from being physically active enough to lose enough weight.  As he says, he put on about 80 pounds after his coronary bypass graft in 2082, and he has had trouble losing the weight. He is considering weight reduction surgery, but has not made a decision about this yet.  He is struggling with the decision.\n\nI would support him either way in this regard, encouraging him to lose weight however he can do so.\n\nIn terms of his lower extremities, his exam demonstrates diminished pulses (absent to palpation) in both ankles, but they are audible by Doppler.  Both feet are well perfused, with good capillary refill.  He has no ulcers or gangrene.\n\nFrom a cardiac standpoint, Chris is doing well.  He denies significant dyspnea or chest discomfort, although he is limited in terms of walking because of his legs.  It has been 11 years since his bypass operation, and I think it would be reasonable to do a stress test on him to make certain that there is no evidence of silent ischemia.  While this might be controversial, as to whether to do a stress test or not, my own gut feeling is that it is probably the right time in this patient with significant risk factors and limitations on the basis of his lower extremity disease.  He requests specifically we do this study here, so I will take the liberty of ordering an adenosine MIBI, and certainly will forward you the results.\n\nOtherwise, Chris is doing great.  We will continue to work on risk factor modification and I will see him again in six months.  We will also order an exercise ABI and duplex of his lower extremities to assess where we stand at the present time.  If his symptoms progress to the point where they are more disabling, then we would consider further evaluation.

He last underwent intervention on his right leg vessels in December 2093. He underwent PTA/Stenting of the right external and common iliac arteries and PTA of the right common femoral/Profunda arteries. As you know, he previously has had patch endarterectomy of his left common femoral and common iliac and popliteal stenting on the left.\n\nHe previously has undergone CABG in 2082 with repeat angio in 2091 showing patent IMA to LAD graft, patent SVG-OM1 graft, and occluded grafts to OM2 and RCA. He underwent rotastenting of his native RCA with a BMS at that time.\n\nAdditionally, he has asymptomatic moderate RICA stenosis with mild LICA stenosis.\n\n\nHe returns today for review. He remains in reasonable health. He is still struggling to lose weight and is interested in bariatric surgery. He has limiting bilateral claudication worse since his last visit, on each side. He also has dyspnea on exertion but does not describe angina. However, it is now 3 years since his last nulcear perfusion study. He does not report any neurovascular symptoms.\n\n\n\n\tPast medical history:\n   CAD \n-- 2082 CABG x 3 \n-- 10/9/91 LIMA to LAD patent; mod LAD stenosis beyond graft; SVT to OM patent; SVG to RCA occl @ origin \n-- 10/91 rota-stenting of mid RCA 99% --&gt; 0% \nHypertension. \nHyperlipidemia. \nPAD \n-- 11/88 left common femoral and left popliteal artery revasc; stent Medtronic bridge Assurant ot left common iliac art \n-- 2/89 right external and internal and right common femoral artery revasc; stent to right common femoral art \nObesity. \nType 2 diabetes mellitus (2/2089 HgbA1c -- 6.50) \nDepressive disorder, none x 20 years, no hospitalization or harm to self \nCervical spine disease s/p C6-C7 disk surgery 2079 \nCongenital hypospadias. \nProstatitis- since age 30, takes antibiotic daily. \nHemorrhoids. \nColonic polyps. \nChronic normocytic anemia. \nBeginning of cataracts \n\nMedications: \nEcASA 325 mg daily \nNPH 68 u qpm about 9pm \nAtacand 16 mg daily \nGlyburide 3 mg bid \nMetroprolol 25 mg tid (patient takes 75 mg daily) \nNorvasc 5 mg daily \nJanuvia 100 mg daily \nBactrim SS 1 tab daily \nCrestor 20 mg daily \nPristiq 50 mg daily \nMirtazapine 7.5 mg qhs \n\n\n\n\t\n\n\tChanges to Allergies\n\t\nFentanyl - reaction: see comment (nausea and vomiting during 11/23/2088 catheterization) [reviewed]\nNKA: No Known Allergies - reaction: see comment (No known allergies to shellfish, iodine, or contrast media) [reviewed]\nPenicillins - reaction: Rash [reviewed]\n\n\n\tFamily history:\n   Positive for CVD and DM.\n\n\n\n\tSocial history:\n   Married, glazier, 3 grown adult children \nTob: quit 2071 smoked 3 packs of cigarettes per day for approximately 30 years \nExercise: Negative for any regular exercise b/c of claudication \nETOH: 1 beer a week \nNegative for illicit drug use. \n\n\nPhysical examination:\n\t\n-Pulse: 77  \n-General:   No acute distress.\n-Skin:   No rashes, anicteric.\n-Heent:   Unremarkable\n-Neck:   Carotids 2+ without bruits.

My findings and plans are elaborated on the note above.  Issues:1) 12 years out from CABG. He is experiencing increasing DOE, which is likely due to his weight and other factors. but I am concerned that we make certain his myocardial perfusion is OK.  Will order Stress MIBI.2) PAD- claudicating L&gt;R leg...calf.  Rutherford 2.  Disabling. Has signif disease previously treated. Will review films and consider repeat CTA to decide whether he warrants relook and repeat intervention.

Her last stress test was in January 2082 and was without ischemia with a posterobasal scar (Adeno MIBI). A recent echo in June 2081 done to evaluate increased LE edema was normal.\n\n\nProblems:\n      \n\n\nCoronary artery disease  -  She reports an increased frequency of her nighttime CP and takes SL TNG when with good relief. Takes it about once/month. These episodes only occur at night when she is in bed.  Her echo showed preserved LV function and no significnat valvular disease.  A repeat adenosine MIBI was negative for recurrent ischemia with an inferobasal scar and LVEF 54%. I advised her to take an H2 blocker before bedtime and if symptoms don't improve, seek a workup with her PCP.\n\n\n      \n\n\nHyperlipidemia  -  Her last lipid profile showed that her LDL was in range at 67, and her TG were normal! I advised her about the metabolic syndrome and the importance of careful diabetic control as well as regular exercise.  Continue her present dose of statin.\n\n\n      \n\n\nHTN  -  Her BP is well-controlled today. Continue her current regimen.\n\n\n      \n\n\nChanges to Medications this visit\n      \nGlucophage 500 mg   bid half a tab\nlisinopril 40 mg   qd End: 6/23/2082 - Inactivated\nfosinopril 40 mg   QD QTY:90 Refills:1 year Start: 11/21/2072\nNorvasc 5 mg 1/2  qd half a tab\nnitroglycerin 0.4 mg  sl PRN QTY:100 Refills:3 Start: 08/20/2078\nIsordil 40 mg   tid\nLopressor 25 mg 1/2  bid half a tab\naspirin 81 mg   QD\nacetaminophen and codeine (tylenol with codeine #3) tablets 1-2 tabs  po q 4-6 hours PRN pain QTY:100 Refills:1 Start: 04/14/2081\nPravachol 20 mg   qd\nTrusopt 1 drop  od daily\nAlphagan P 0.15% x 1 drop  ou bid\nTylenol 325mg x 2 tabs  po q4-6h PRN pain\n\n\nDisposition:\n6 months with me\n\n\n      \nBarbara T.

Pt schedulled for dialysis on Friday please notify Dr Mcdaniel of his arrival.\n\n3. CABG/MVR/MAZE schedulled for Thursday\nRecord date: 2067-08-02\n\n60 year old gentleman presents for follow-up of right lower extremity foot ulcer.  It would appear that two weeks prior, the patient sustained a burn to the right lower extremity while walking on a hot sandy beach.  He has been followed regularly by a podiatrist Dr. Sanchez, who has attempted debridement of lesion.  He also asked that the patient receive vancomycin at the time of his dialysis.\n\nIn the setting of four compliance and poor wound healing, the patient was admitted for 48 hours to the Northport Veterans Hospital.  Records are not immediately available but it would appear that he received intravenous antibiotics at that time.  He was discharged without clear follow-up.\n\nThe patient presents to my office with his foot unwrapped and undressed.  He has been ambulating on the wound.  He reports that it appears less red and has less drainage than at his initial presentation.  He reports no pain.\n\nHaving spoken with his podiatrist, it would appear that the patient has been noncompliant with leg elevation and dressing overall.\n\n\nReview of systems is otherwise negative.  \n\nPast Medical History:\n\nNeuropathy \nNephropathy : cr. 2.6. 3.3 gm proteinuria.

Neck: Supple without JVD, lymphadenopathy, or thyromegaly.  Chest: Clear to auscultation bilaterally without wheezes or rhonchi or rhales.  Cardiac: Regular rate and rhythm, normal S1 and S2 without murmurs rubs or gallops.  Extremities: Right lower extremity with a 1.6 cm x 1.6 cm black eschar to be great toe.  Lesion is soft.  It is unclear if there is significant tracking beneath the surface.  A 3 cm x 2 cm flat based ulcer with surrounding callus formation is noted to be ball of the right foot with some granulation and no drainage.  A collar is noted.  No surrounding erythema is appreciated.  Dorsalis pedis and posterior tibial pulses are palpable but clearly diminished.\n\nAssessment and plan: This is a 60 year old gentleman with multiple medical issues including end-stage renal disease my for regurgitation, congestive heart failure, severe peripheral neuropathy, diabetes.  Present in with two large altars to the right lower extremity.  He is status post hospitalization and some debridement and appears to have had little overall improvement in clinical status.  I will proceed with an aggressive outpatient treatment plan however I suspect that he will need inpatient admission once again if significant improvement is not rapidly obtained.  A referral has been made to the Island Medical Center wound clinic for this Tuesday.  Visiting nurse has been arranged for his home for wound care in the interim.  He is advised to avoid all weight-bearing and to keep his foot dressed at all times.  I have explained to the patient that he is at risk of amputation of at least his right great toe should his healing not improve.\n\nWith regards to his other medical issues, he continues on dialysis.  I have asked for a hemoglobin A1c and fasting cholesterol to be drawn at the time of his dialysis tomorrow.  I'll see the patient on Tuesday.  \n\nHis blood pressure is appropriately controlled and he is no stigmata of congestive heart failure\n\nAt today's visit, the patient's wound was dressed and cleaned the our nursing staff\nRecord date: 2069-04-16\n\n\n\nPatient Name: OGRADY,ULYSSES [ 0937884(IMC) ] Date of Visit: 04/16/2069\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRenal Staff\n\n\nPatient seen and examined on dialysis.

I have served as his PCP for eight years. Pt seen and examined. Case discussed in detail . This is a 62 y/o male with multiple medical issues last admitted in September for increased falls, found to have a small stroke in addition to his likely vascular dementia. Readmitted last week in the setting of Purulent L foot ulcer/ S/P debridement and later TMA. He has a long history well documented in the electronic medical record which is notable for poor compliance with medication and follow-up. At baseline, patient has declined further cardiology workup for his severe mitral regurgitation and cardiomyopathy, has declined treatment for his hyperlipidemia and takes his blood pressure medications with less than 25% compliance. At the time of his last admission, he was actually admitted to a nursing home with plans for long term placement.\n\n\nThe patient's wound has currently not been closed. He has a vac dressing in place. He has been attending dialysis per schedule of nephrology. Current hospital course has been complicated by increased agitation and last evening, self limited substernal chest pain and dyspnea. This resolved spontaneously. He has also been intermittently refusing his medications and has been attempting to ambulate.\n\n\nThis AM.  the patient actually denies ever experiencing chest pain. He also only recalls his foot pain with repeated prompting. He denies any pain, dyspnea\n\n\nROS otherwise negative.,  \nPast Medical History:\n\nNeuropathy Nephropathy : cr. 2.6. 3.3 gm proteinuria.

Presenting with necrotic foot infection, polymicrobial. S/P Rt TMA. Mildly delerious and certainly off from a baseline that was tenuous to start.\n\n\nBy issue:\n\n\n1) CAD: The patient does have CAD, MR and cardiomyopathy that are really not amenable to intervention, given patient noncompliance. The best goal at present is going to be continued medical management. If BP allows, could increase toprol XL, although I suspect that this will not be an option. In addition, would aim to keep even at dialysis.\n\n\nCertainly, cycle CKs and troponin and follow sx. I will defer to Dr. Shah, but I don't see clear benefit for cardiac cath, especially as we are not going to proceed to valve repair at this juncture.  If he were to become more compliant, this might be another consideration and as he is now a CT resident, perhaps this will be a future consideration.\n\n\n2) Delirium: He does have a very tenuous baseline and has significant vascular dementia to start. He is off of this baseline, likely reflecting sundowning, medications and underlying metabolic processes. Please d/c medications that might be contributing to sx. Fluoxetine can be held for now as it was only started 3 weeks prior. Might hold ranitidine as well.  Haldol is d/cd in the setting of his prolonged QTc. Currently on olanzapine. Would continue to follow QTc closely and would d/c this med as well is still prolonged. Please send urine culture and surveillance blood cultures.\n\n\n3) Infection: Appreciate excellent surgical management of patient's wound. Levofloxacin has been d/cd  2nd to concerns for altered mental status. All bacteria are sensitive to aztreonam so perhaps this would be a reasonable alternative. Would seek ID input to the end. Wound care per vascular with plans for D/C when stable and return for closure in the future. \n4) ESRD: Patient HAD dialysis today . Recs per nephrology\n3) DM: HgA1c was at target. Please cover as needed with RISS for now. 5) Competency: certainly not able to make informed decisions at this time. Please confirm that his daughter is his HCP. Would try to use a Chadian interpreter and not daughters if at all possible.\n Thanks,   \n____________________________________Paul Anthony Jaramillo, M.D.Pager # 52666.Sheila Strong to cover for Thursday and Friday"}

He is a former patient of Dr. Ilya Light. He is a 59-year-old man with diabetes type 2, hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, and mild coronary artery disease who had a brief episode of atrial flutter in 2069. He presented in 2069 with chest pain and rapid heart rate following snow shoveling. He was found to be in atrial flutter with a rapid ventricular response. He was cardioverted two days later and has remained in sinus rhythm since then. Echocardiogram performed on 02/22/2069 showed normal ejection fraction of 72%, borderline left atrium at 43 mm, and no significant valvular abnormalities. Stress test performed on 03/16/2069 showed 5 minutes of exercise, 7 METS, and a peak double product of 22, 000. He had no EKG changes, and a small mild posterobasilar defect suggestive of a very limited area of mild ischemia. The patient has been managed medically since then. He has used an event monitor and since then has not had any subsequent episodes of atrial flutter or fibrillation.\n\n\n\nThe patient has been doing well over the past several months. Currently, he exercises once or twice a week by swimming 30 minutes in a pool. A few months ago, he was exercising almost everyday. His weight has been up and down. He does not complain of any chest pain, shortness of breath, or other symptoms. Occasionally in the morning when he takes his pulse, he notices a skipped beat. I have reassured him that this is not a cause for concern.\n\n\n\nPast medical history:\n\n   Diabetes, hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, atrial flutter as above, coronary artery disease as above, Bell's palsy with residual left eye tearing, kidney stones, and glaucoma.\n\n\n\nCurrent Medications:\n\n  lisinopril 20 mg QD\n\n Glucophage 1 g BID\n\n glyburide 10 mg BID\n\n atenolol 50 mg QAM; Dir: and 25 mg QPM\n\n Lopid 600 mg BID\n\n allopurinol 300 mg QD\n\n omeprazole 20 mg QD\n\n aspirin 81 mg QD\n\n Pravachol 80 mg QD\n\n Avandia 8 mg QD\n\n\n\nAllergies:\n\nPenicillin allergy   Penicillin and erythromycin, causing rash.\n\n\n\nFamily history:\n\n   Not significant for coronary artery disease.\n\n\n\nSocial history:\n\n   Former tobacco user, works part time in securities.\n\n\n\nReview of systems:\n\n   As above, otherwise negative.\n\n\n\nPhysical examination:\n\n-Pulse:   60\n\n-General:   Obese talkative man in no distress\n\n-Chest:   Lungs are clear bilaterally\n\n-Cardiac:   JVP is 7 cm with normal waveform.  PMI is discrete and nondisplaced.  Regular rate and rhythm with normal S1 and S2.  Soft 2/6 holosystolic murmur heard at the lower left sternal border\n\n-Abdomen:   Obese and tender\n\n-Extremities:   Have trace edema with chronic venous stasis changes\n\n\n\nSelected recent labs:\n\n   On 06/18/2070, total cholesterol 168, triglycerides 104, HDL 38, and LDL 109.  His Pravachol dose has been increased since this time.\n\n\n\nAssessment and plan:\n\n   This is a 59-year-old man with metabolic syndrome, diabetes type 2, hyperlipidemia, hypertension, obesity, and mild coronary artery disease that has been medically managed. He is doing well. He had an episode of atrial flutter for two days in 2069 but has not had any repeat episodes. He is currently not anticoagulated. Given new recommendations, his target LDL should be less than 70. He is due for a fasting lipid profile in one week. If his LDL is not below 70, then he should either be switched to Lipitor 80 mg day or Zetia should be added to his present regimen. He is slightly hypertensive today with a blood pressure of 140/75. The patient will check his blood pressure at home since he is somewhat anxious male. In the office today, if his blood pressure remains elevated, then I will increase his lisinopril to 30 mg a day. Otherwise, he is doing very well without any cardiac symptoms.\n\n\n\nChanges to Medications this visit\n\nlisinopril 20 mg   QD\n\nGlucophage 1 g   BID\n\nglyburide 10 mg   BID\n\natenolol 50 mg   QAM and 25 mg QPM\n\nLopid 600 mg   BID\n\nallopurinol 300 mg   QD\n\nomeprazole 20 mg   QD\n\naspirin 81 mg   QD\n\nPravachol 80 mg   QD\n\nAvandia 8 mg   QD\n\n\n\nThank you for allowing me to participate in the care of this patient.

Initially the patient was seen at Neligh Clinic and cardiac ischemia was ruled out.  She was found to have a blood\n\npressure of 250 systolic at Neligh Clinic associated with persistent\n\nheadaches.  She was transferred to American Legion Hospital after being\n\nfound collapsed on the floor of the hospital bathroom.  She was transferred to the\n\nIntensive Care Unit at Neligh Clinic and treated for tonic-clonic\n\nconvulsions with diazepam and lorazepam. She also suffered a urinary tract\n\ninfection in hospital, treated with Cipro.\n\n\n\nShe was transferred to the American Legion Hospital on October 02, 2089,\n\nat which time she was awake but unable to give a history. \n\n\n\nOn admission to American Legion Hospital she had a blood pressure of\n\n127/70, pulse was 80, and temperature was 99.3.  She had a myxedematous face and\n\nwas obese.  She was cardiovascularly stable.  Neurologically, she was able to move\n\nall four extremities with good strength and symmetrical reflexes.  Cranial nerves\n\nintact.  Initially, the impression was that patient suffered seizure secondary to\n\nelevated blood pressure.  Most likely, she suffered hypertensive encephalopathy. \n\nPatient underwent neurologic evaluation including MRA of the brain, lumbar\n\npuncture, both of which were negative.  Electroencephalogram was  performed and\n\nshowed no epileptiform foci and diffuse temporal slowing bilaterally.  The patient's\n\nalertness and responsiveness increased gradually during the hospital stay.  She had\n\nan episode of chest pain which was associated with some ST flattening in the lateral\n\nleads.  Acute cardiac event was ruled out.  The patient underwent a course of\n\nphysical therapy and then, finally, was transferred to a rehabilitation facility.  A\n\nspecific cause of the patient's seizure was not found although it was assumed that\n\nthis might have been provoked by the hypertensive encephalopathy associated with\n\nuse of ciprofloxacin for the treatment of the UTI which could have lowered her\n\nthreshold for seizure activity.  Upon discharge, the patient was in stable condition.\n\n\n\nPAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Remarkable for seizure, type II diabetes mellitus,\n\npanhypopituitarism secondary to pituitary surg, hypertension, right arm bone\n\ntumor excision associated with right radial neuropathy, and hyperlipidemia.\n\n\n\nMEDICATIONS:  See LMR.\n\nFAMILY HISTORY:  Negative.\n\nSOCIAL HISTORY:  Denies alcohol intake, smoking.\n\n\n\nREVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  Denies visual or hearing disturbance, headaches,\n\nweakness, numbness, seizure activity, chest pain, palpitations, syncope, dyspnea,\n\nwheezing, cough, coryza, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, constipation, abdominal pain. \n\n\n\nPositive for mild nocturia with no dysuria.  No polydipsia.  Positive mild\n\nparesthesias right upper extremity.  Occasional mid-morning reactions.

Patient confused and unable to give history at time of admission. As per son and daughter, they have noticed increasing confusion and inappropriate behavior over the past 3 days. They report that she has woken up in the middle of the night c/o feeling weak and confused. The first two nights, her son treated her  initially with increasing lactulose administration when she would wake up at night (although it is unclear whether she had any increase in her stool) and he reports that she would behave better during the day. On the night prior to administration, the patient urinated in her bed at night and called her daughter on the phone in the middle of the night. She also forgot the names of her grandchildren. The son became worried about her behavior, contacted her PCP, and brought her to the ALH ED.\n\n\n\nThe family reports that she experienced similar behavior prior to grand-mal seizures that were a consequence of uncontrolled hypertension about 2 yrs ago.

Bone\n\n\tand soft-tissue windows were reviewed.\n\n\tComparison: MRI dated 7/16/91\n\n\tFindings:\n\n\tThe cerebral parenchyma, posterior fossa, basal cisterns and\n\n\tventricular system appear normal. There is no evidence of any mass\n\n\tor mass effect. There is no evidence of acute infarction although\n\n\tthis would be better assessed by MR with diffusion. There is no\n\n\tevidence of parenchymal or extra-axial hemorrhage.\n\n\tA right frontal mucocele has enlarged since the previous exam. It\n\n\textends into the right orbit resulting in proptosis.  There are\n\n\tbilateral lens implants.\n\n\t\n\nIMPRESSION:\n\n\tNo acute intracranial hemorrhage. Enlarging right frontal mucocele\n\n\twhich causes right proptosis.\n\n\n\nPituitary MRI: (7/91)\n\n\tNo evidence of recurrent pituitary adenoma.  Interval increase in\n\n\tthe size of an expansile lesion within the right ethmoid bed, with\n\n\tincreased extension into the right orbit.  The lesion contacts the\n\n\tright globe.

Chest pain did not occur.\n\nThe baseline cardiac rhythm was normal sinus rhythm. The rest\n\nelectrocardiogram revealed nonspecific ST segment and T-wave\n\nabnormalities. Small inferior q's.  No ST segment changes were observed during this test.  Negative for ischemia. However, the sensitivity of Adenosine-induced ST segment changes for detecting significant CAD is limited.\n\nSCAN RESULTS:\n\nThe left ventricle is normal in size. Regional left ventricular perfusion is normal. The left ventricular ejection fraction was 77% on the stress study. Regional wall motion was normal on the stress study.\n\nCONCLUSIONS:\n\nThe ECG response to pharmacological stress was  negative for ischemia. The myocardial scans are within normal limits and do not demonstrate evidence of myocardial ischemia or infarction.\n\n\n\nALH  CARDIAC ULTRASOUND        11-May-2087        Serial#  732087     Final\n\n                                     (normal)     (Completed only if abn.)\n\nMITRAL VALVE       NORM  AO    29 mm.(24-39mm)    SEGMENT   BASE  MID  APEX\n\nLEFT ATRIUM        NORM\n\nAV.

BG/thalamus hemorrhage with IVH extension, with potential for fatal neurologic deterioration\n\nCritical Care Min: 35 min\n\n\n\n\nHistory: Ms. Olivo is a 75-year-old RHW with DM, HTN and dementia, LSW at 11:00 a.m., then found by son at 1:45 pm to be less responsive with left-sided weakness. BP was 200/96 when EMS arrived. Here her SBP was in the 220s with heart rate in the 50-60s.  Her initial exam revealed somnolence, but able to follow some very simple commands like squeezing hand, nodding head; she had right gaze deviation, left hemianopsia, left facial palsy, left arm \nand leg plegia, right arm and leg paresis, and dysarthria.  She received 10 mg of hydralazine for her SBP greater than 220.  CT revealed a right basal ganglia/thalamic hemorrhage with intraventricular extension including casting of the 4th ventricle, 7 mm mls to the left, contrast extravasation suggestive of active hemorrhage but no evidence of any vascular abnormality.  She was intubated for worsening mental status and had an a-line placed for Bp monitoring and management. \n\n\n\nAt baseline, Ms. Olivo is wheelchair-bound, according to her daughter, due to her neuropathy.  She is dependent for all of her ADLs and has a home health aide.  \n\n\n\nPMHx: DM, HTN, dementia, h/o sz d/o not on AED now, Pituitary adenoma, s/p hypophysectomy, hypothyroidism, COPD, dyslipidemia, obesity, fatty liver, fibromyalgia, arthritis, depression, anxiety, meningitis, Rt humerus fx/osteo/nonunion, Cirrhosis or unclear etiology with hyperammonemia, Neuropathy with paresthesias, presumably due to diabetes\n\n\n\nHome meds: Mirtazapine 15 mg daily, Namenda 10 mg daily, Potassium supplementation 20 meq daily, Levothyroxine 100 mcg daily, Metoprolol (unclear if metoprolol succinate or tartrate) 25 mg daily, Prednisone 2.5 mg daily, MVI\n\n\n\nAll: Morphine ( Unknown ) Codeine ( Unknown ) ACE Inhibitor ( Unknown ) LISINOPRIL (cough ) CIPROFLOXACIN HCL (dec effects of sz med ) ATORVASTATIN (abnormal LFT )\n\n\n\nSH: Lives with her son in Ardmore.

CTA showed at least 3 spot signs indicating active hemorrhage but no evidence of any vascular abnormality.\n\n\n\n\n\nAssessment: \nOlivo is a 75-year-old right-handed woman with diabetes mellitus, HTN and dementia, and found with a ~ 11 cc R. BG/thalamic bleed with pan-ventricular extension with casted 3rd and 4th ventricles, and mild midline shift.

He brings in his blood sugar values with him today.  These are \nimproved since his last visit, and somewhat more believable ranging from \n128 to 195, predominantly higher in the evenings more than the mornings \nranging from 150 to 190.  He is currently on a somewhat odd regime of 6 \nunits of insulin regular twice a day, with a large 24 units of insulin \nat night, and 14 units insulin in the morning.  He has not had any \nfurther hypoglycemic attacks, is having no nocturnal awakening, and \nseems to be sticking more to the diet.  He has however gained some \nweight, which is a little disconcerting.  He does attend a podiatrist \nand is doing well from that perspective.  He is to return to the \nophthalmologist for further diabetic screening later on in the year.  He \nmissed his last nutrition appointment and is not interested in further \nfollow-up with nutrition at this time.\n2.  Cardiovascular.  He is on atorvastatin 20 mg for hyperglyceridemia, \natenolol 25 mg, and aspirin.  Further question regarding his stroke back \nin 2061 shows that this presents with confusional episode with \nunsteadiness, resolving after approximately 36 hours, and he was found \nto have a hole in his heart at that time.  He was eventually stopped off \nCoumadin in 2063, but had a recurrent episode at that time and he was \nput on Coumadin for life at that point.  He had an aborted myocardial \ninfarction in 2067.  He has had no chest pain in the interim, has good \nexercise tolerance with walking, although, he can only run about 50 \nyards before getting very short of breath.  He has no orthopnea or PND.  \nHe has no chest pain or use of sublingual nitro.\n3.  Health maintenance.  We discussed screening colonoscopy versus \nflexible sigmoidoscopy and the relative benefit of each of those.  He \nhas agreed to proceed with colonoscopy, and I have instructed him stop \nhis Coumadin and aspirin five days before the test and to have an INR \nchecked on the day prior to the test.  This will be scheduled by our \nsecretary.  He will restart the Coumadin after the colonoscopy at his \nstandard dose and titrate up slowly.\n\nCURRENT MEDICATIONS:  Include aspirin, atenolol, insulin, Coumadin, and \nLipitor.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFoy, Keonte\n73235790\n06/15/70\nPage 2\n\nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  His blood pressure is 148/82.  He is tachycardic \nat 98 beats per minute.  Examination of his eyes shows persistent left-\nsided cataract.  Examination of the heart and lungs was normal.  The \nabdominal examination is also normal.  His injection sites were clean \nand without erythema.  There is no evidence of peripheral neuropathy and \nhis feet appeared well.\n\nWe spent some time today talking about diabetes education again, \nincluding appropriate foods, drinks, and what items to avoid.\n\nPLAN:\n1.  Supplied educational materials regarding diabetes management, \nincluding calorie counting, weight loss, information about hypoglycemia \nand hyperglycemia, and diabetic eye care.\n2.  I have increased insulin in the mornings from 14 to 16 units and \nleft the other doses as is.\n3.  I have increased the atenolol from 25 mg to 50 mg for hypertension \nand cardioprotection with the tachycardia.\n4.  We will check cholesterol, hemoglobin A1c, CBC, and chem-7.\n5.  I have scheduled an elective outpatient colonoscopy as detailed \nabove for colorectal cancer screening.\n6.  Return to see in a week's time, understands.  He can discuss any \nmanagement issues regarding his insulin doses or others anytime.\n\n\n\nYale Jordan, M.D.\n\nYJ:isenberg:74:585:40;00-10142.doc;DD:06/15/70;DT:06/16/70;DV:06/15/70\n\n\n\n========================== Preceptor's Note ==========================\n\n\n\n62 year old man with dm and vascular disease.

This occurred approximately one week ago in the setting of walking up the stairs and carrying a heavy package.  He notes that his pulse went up to 101 and he had overall felt \"tired in his chest\".  He did not take any nitroglycerine, and his symptoms promptly resolved.  He has continued to notice episodes of intermittent rapid pulses with pulses up to 100.  He has had no syncope or near syncope.  Generally, he has been walking on the treadmill up to four to six miles a day several times a week.  Over the last few weeks, he has felt a little bit more fatigued and now can only walk approximately four miles.  He has not had any sustained palpitation, syncope, or near syncope, but has noted a slight decrease in his exercise tolerance.\n\n\n\nProblem List (reviewed)\n\n\n\nCoronary artery disease MAJOR \n\nHypertension MAJOR \n\nDiabetes mellitus MAJOR \n\nCarpal tunnel syndrome MAJOR \n\nAllergic rhinitis MAJOR \n\nAngina pectoris MAJOR STATUS POST\n\nProstatic carcinoma MAJOR \n\nCerebrovascular accident MAJOR \n\nSleep apnea MAJOR \n\nGastroesophageal reflux disease MAJOR \n\nHyperlipidemia MAJOR \n\nColonic polyp MAJOR \n\n\n\nMajor Problems\n\n\n\n\n\nCoronary artery disease\n\nsee HPI\n\n\n\nHypertension\n\nThe patient monitors his blood pressure closely at home and finds it to be at around 120/70.

Given his slightly elevated pulse rate, his atenolol will be increased to 25 mg PO BID from one per day which is what he is currently taking.  His blood pressure is under good control.  Given his recent episode of repeat stress test will be sent.  If there is any prolonged episode of pain, he will come to the emergency room immediately.  He is encouraged to use nitroglycerine sublingually if he has any evidence or any chest pressure.  For his diabetes, his labs will be sent.  He remains on Coumadin for anticoagulation, and his INR has been therapeutic.  He will follow up in three months but sooner pending the above evaluation.  If he has any increase in his symptoms, he will be admitted immediately.\n\n\n\nNote transcribed by outside service\n\n\t\t\t\n\n  Transcription errors may be present.\n\n\n\nSigned electronically by Riddle, Rhonda on Sep 25, 2092\nRecord date: 2092-12-31\n\n\n\n\n\nINTERNAL MEDICINE ASSOCIATES\n\nHOLDEN DISTRICT HOSPITAL\n\n\n\nReason for visit\n\n\t\t\t\n\n  Followup of recent MI and multiple medical problems.\n\n\n\nHistory of present illness\n\n\t\t\t\n\n  Since the patient's last visit, he developed a maculopapular rash and his Plavix was discontinued.  Since this is the only new medication, it was presumed that Plavix was the cause of the new skin rash.  He also changed his beta blocker and started Toprol XL approximately one week ago.  At home, he states his pulse has been under better control, and now, is in the 60 range.  He denies any palpitations, PND, orthopnea, or shortness of breath.  He has had no recurrent angina and has tried this week to slowly start to walk for about 15 minutes on his treadmill at a low pace.  He has not had any angina or chest pain with this walking routine.  He also knows that his sugars at home had been very low at 55 and 56 in the evening.  He has had weight loss and slightly diminished appetite and this may account for his low blood sugars.  He is here for a followup.  Of note, his Bumex dose was decreased due to an elevated BUN and creatinine.  His weight has been stabled, and he feels better on the lower dose of diuretics without symptoms of congestive heart failure.\n\n\n\nMajor Problems\n\n\n\n\n\nCoronary artery disease\n\nsee HPI\n\n\n\nAtrial fibrillation\n\nRx with rate control, and coumadin. rate 60,s at home.

Currently, he has no symptoms of unstable angina and no evidence of congestive heart failure on exam.  His blood sugars have been low, and therefore, he will hold his glyburide for now.  His pulse remained somewhat elevated, and he will follow up with his cardiologist relative to the need for cardioversion for an attempt to get him back into normal sinus rhythm.  His weight control has been a problem.  He will slowly increase his ambulation and will check his pulse and blood pressure at home.  He will follow up here in two months or sooner if needed.\n\n\n\nNote transcribed by outside service\n\n\t\t\t\n\n  Transcription errors may be present.\n\n\n\nSigned electronically by Riddle, Rhonda on Jan 07, 2093"}

Diabetes:  Continues on oral agents since 2087.  A1C is below 7.0 at goal. No\n       hypoglycemia.  Fasting sugars less than 130 on balance.  Has regular follow up.\n       2.   Hypertension:  Blood pressure well controlled on valsartan.  Cardiac ultrasound\n       2111 with normal ejection fraction, no LVH and normal mitral regurg.  Continue\n       current program.\n       3.   Coronary artery disease:  Patient had mildly abnormal stress test with moderate\n       posterior ischemia in 2112. This was done due to exertional shortness of breath.\n       Those symptoms have essentially resolved. He has never used nitroglycerin.  He\n       has gone through the cardiac rehab program. Now put on beta blocker due to\n       patient's preference. No strong indication given. No MI or symptomatic angina.\n       4.   Hyperlipidemia:  Tight control of lipids achieved on Zocor.  LDL less than 100.\n       5.   Stroke: Status-post stroke 2111 with slurred speech and left facial droop.\n       Warfarin recommended for one year at that time for presumed cardiac embolus. \n       Considered discontinuing this visit.  \n       6.   Anemia: Patient has had a mild hyperproliferative anemia.  Has been seen by Dr.\n       Barr.  This has remained stable.  Bone marrow biopsy nondiagnostic.\n       7.   Hypogonadism:  Patient has been evaluated by Dr. Dominique Stokes.  Placed on\n       AndroGel 2111.  Testosterone levels have improved.  Question if that has\n       improved his fatigue and anemia.\n  \n  Review of systems:  He does have sleep apnea on CPAP.  Has bilateral hearing loss on\n  audiogram. Has some peripheral edema on occasion.  Have recommended support\n  stockings.

Reason for visit: 73 year old male for evaluation/management multiple\n  issues.  \n  \n  Diabetes: he is on maximal dose of glipizide and Glucophage and A1C has been going up\n  steadily now to 8.0.  His sugars vary greatly in the morning from 100 to 174.  He hasn't\n  been checking pre dinner.  We discussed insulin and he really is quite against it.  We will\n  continue discussion open.  Asked him to check pre dinner sugars.  \n  \n  Coronary disease: patient had a mild posterior ischemia in 2112 on a screening stress test. \n  He is actually having some progressive dyspnea on exertion and a sense of chest\n  tightness with one block.  He is a bit of a denier.  He hasn't tried nitroglycerin, which I\n  have given him.  I suggested he do that.  He will have a follow up stress test and we will\n  arrange a cardiology consult.  \n  \n  UTI: patient had an E coli UTI 9/13.  He doesn't really have much in terms of other\n  prostate symptoms and no nocturia.  He has however, developed urinary urgency again in\n  the last week or two.  Will check another culture.  May need urology referral.  \n  \n  Knee pain: patient with longstanding DJD of the knees.  Will have a consult at Christiana Hospital considering replacement.  \n  \n  Family history: unchanged.   \n  \n  Review of systems: status post an embolic stroke in 2111 and took warfarin for 2 years\n  and followed by Dr. Dillon.  He is still on Celexa for depression.  He is having hearing\n  loss with equivocal audiograms.  Suggested otology consult at Naples Community Hospital.  He has\n  a mild hypoproliferative anemia that is stable.  Sleep apnea.  All other systems negative. \n  \n  Physical exam: his weight is 196 pounds.  Most recent 195.  BP was 140/70.  Pulse 60. \n  Skin normal.  Nodes: none.  Chest clear lungs.  Cardiac: S1, S2 normal.  Grade II/VI\n  systolic murmur of mitral regurgitation (confirmed by echo).  Abdomen no mass or\n  organomegaly.  Extremities: mild venous stasis.  Trace edema.  DP pulses are 1+.\n  \n  Assessment: management of multiple medical problems as above.

Hypertension.  Hyperlipidemia.  Sleep apnea. 2/1/11 stroke 4/4/12 exercise sestamibi-SAH: Small posterolateral scar and ischemia  2/21/14 exercise sestamibi-SAH: Moderate-severe anterior apical and inferior ischemia.\n\n\n\nMedications: Glucophage 850 mg t.i.d., glipizide 10 mg b.i.d., Cozaar 50 mg, Zocor 20 mg, Detrol 2 mg, Colace, aspirin 81, isosorbide 40 mg q.a.m., multivitamin, glucosamine and chondroitin b.i.d., Naprosyn 220-2 pills b.i.d., Celexa 20 mg. BiPAP\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\n\nReactions to Medicines: None\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\n\nChief Complaint: Shortness of breath which is, in fact, chest tightness\n\n\n\nHistory of Present Illness: This 73 year-old hypertensive hyperlipidemic diabetic had a previous stroke on 2/1/11 and a recent exercise test that showed extensive ischemia as noted above.  He has noted shortness or breath for the last three months.  In fact the shortness of breath is exertional chest tightness which comes on with exertion and is relieved by rest.  He is sent by Dr. Everhart for consideration for coronary angiogram.  On 1/08/14 his cholesterol was 165, triglyceride 109, HDL 54 and LDL 89.  He does get some lightheadedness if he has a high sugar.  He's had no rapid heart action or sudden dizzy spells.\n\n\n\nROS:Const.-Negative\n\nEyes -Negative\n\nENMT: Bilateral hearing loss\n\nCV: See above\n\nRespiratory: Sleep apnea\n\nGI -.  Recent constipation  \n\nGU -Impotence.  Urgency and incontinence  \n\nMS -  arthritis of both knees and hands.  Considering knee replacement\n\nSkin - Negative\n\nNeuro -CVA in past.  Mild residual left facial drooping and occasional trouble finding words.\n\nPsych - Depression well controlled on Celexa\n\nEndocrine -  Diabetes\n\nHeme-No blood problems\n\nAllergies - No drug allergies and no allergies to dye\n\n\n\nPast History:  T & A, laparoscopic cholecystectomy.  He has no other major illnesses.  He does not smoke and drinks about one glass of wine per day.\n\n\n\nFamily History: His father died at 83 of a stroke, cancer and diabetes.  Mother died at 73 of heart disease, diabetes and cancer.  Two sisters are living without diabetes.\n\n\n\nSocial History:  He a mapping technologist and is actively working.  He is divorced and has two children and one grandchild.  His significant other works as an optician.  She is divorced and has three children and one grandchild.\n\n\n\nComplete Cardiovascular Exam:. BP 100 50/65.  His jugular venous pressure is seven and he has no carotid bruits.  He has no rales.  He has a 1/6 aortic ejection murmur, a 2/6 MR murmur at the apex with a normal S2 and no S3.  He has no enlargement of the liver and no edema.\n\n\n\nEKG:   NSR 59, LAE, NSTTWA\n\n\n\nAssessment: I agree he clearly needs a coronary angiogram as well as a left ventricular angiogram to assess MR.  He should also have a left right heart catheter because of the aortic ejection murmur.  In the meantime I will ask into double his isosorbide to 40 mg in the morning and again at 3 p.m. to give him better protection throughout the day.  I will ask him to increase his aspirin to 325 mg a day.  I will also add fish oil 1000 mg a day which is been shown to reduce the risk of sudden death.  Finally we will double his Zocor to 40 mg to try to reach the new goal of an LDL of less than 70.  I explained the rationale for proceeding on with the catheterization and the probability that we will find multivessel disease that will not be suitable for PCI but rather for continued medicine or possible surgery.  Of course the catheterization will determine that.  He should not consider any total knee operation until the cardiac status is clarified.\n\n\n\n\n\nQuentin T.

He was treated with CHOP in 2066 followed by radiotherapy, completed in Nov 2066.  He was free of disease since then until May 2073.  He sought primary care for a URI and was noted to be anemic (HCT 31).  His counts were followed and when his HCT dropped as low as 22 a Bone Marrow was done and showed myelodysplastic syndrome.  He was considered for a allogenic stem-cell transplant.  His major complaint is a dry cough that he has had since May 2073.   It is provoked by eating, drinking and lying down.  And only occasionally does he produce any sputum.  He has been on numerous antibiotics in the past four months for the cough and he also developed a periorbital cellulitis for which he was hospitalized at Educare-Fargo for which he received a 3 week course of Ceftriaxone, Nafcillin and flagyl (finished at the end of July).  In retrospect, he recognizes sinus pressure/congestion associated with periorbital cellulitis.  In August 2073 he had a questionable LLL PNA and was treated with cipro.  On pre-transplant work-up, CXR revealed increase    conspicuity of ill-defined LL zone opacity.      CT chest reviewed today revealed mutlifocal pneumonia with associated radiation-related changes.  \n\nThroughout this time period he has only had a few days of fever for which he was at KCGH and given abx and defervesced.  He recalls    nightsweats    as the fevers broke.  He does admit to maybe a 10 lb weight loss in the past 4 months.  He denies SOB (unless he   s severely anemic), orthopnea, sore throat, dysphagia, odynophagia, CP, palpitations, angina-like symptoms, acid-reflux, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, constipation, BRBPR, dysuria, frequency, nocturia, joint or muscle pain.

No pneumothorax is seen .\n      \nImpression:\n66 yo M with h/o IDDM, large cell lymphoma in 2066, and now with myelodysplastic syndrome who presents with fourth months of cough of unclear etiology.\n\nThe differential diagnosis is broad and includes both infectious and non-infectious diagnoses.  Our leading diagnosis is either radiation fibrosis or a primary interstitial lung disease, such as COP.  However, we also think that several infectious etiologies should be considered.  Endemic mycoses (histo, blasto and crypto), cryptococcal pneumonia, nocardiasis, aspergillus, mucormycosis and MAC are some diseases to consider in this patient.  While the clinical picture of granulomas on chest CT and cough is consistent with the diagnosis of mycobacterial disease, the patient is very low risk for this infection and his lack of fevers, progressive weight loss and systemic illness argues against this diagnosis.  \n\nI (AYX) have interviewed and examined Mr. Ware, and confirmed all of the findings documented in this note.   My highest suspicion is for an inflammatory process, such as radiation pneumonitis or BOOP/COP.  An occult infection is quite possible, such as pulmonary MAC or a mold (the lesion in his left lower lobe is especially suspicious).  Clinically he is unchanged over many months, so empiric antibiotics would not be indicated.    \n\n We recommend the following work-up:\n\n-Expectorated sputum for gram stain and culture\n-Induced sputum for\n-PCP\n-Modified AFB smear (looking for Nocardia)\n-Fungal stain and culture\n-Urine histo antigen\n-Serum cryptococcal antigen\n-Weekly monitoring of galactomannan and D-glucan\n-Nasopharyngeal swab for respiratory viral panel (RSV, Adenovirus, Influenza A and B, paraflu A and B) and viral culture\n\nIf the above work-up is unrevealing, please consult pulmonology for a bronchoscopy -- sooner rather than later.\n\nIt is reasonable to start is levaquin 500 mg QD now to treat empirically for typical and atypical pathogens (this medication is scheduled to begin in two days, per protocol).\n\nOur recommendations were communicated to Dr. Dalton and Dr. Robin Jeffery of the patient   s primary team.

The\n\npatient denies chest pain, palpitations, or syncope but does\n\ncomplain of bilateral lower extremity edema times several weeks. \n\nThe patient has been worked up for the symptoms as an outpatient\n\nand placed on Lasix for the past 2 weeks and had an\n\nechocardiogram today, which was remarkable for atrial\n\nfibrillation.  The patient was sent to the Emergency Department\n\nfor further evaluation.  Please see the written record for\n\nfurther details.\n\nPAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Insulin-dependent diabetes,\n\nmyelodysplastic syndrome, status post stem cell transplant.\n\nPAST SURGICAL HISTORY:  Basal cell resection.\n\nSOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient denies smoking, alcohol, or illicit\n\ndrug use.\n\nMEDICATIONS:  Lasix, vitamin D, Lantus, and acyclovir.\n\nALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.\n\nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  I have examined the patient and agree with\n\nthe physical as documented.  Of note, the patient is awake and\n\nalert, in no acute distress.

His post-tx course was unremarkable.  Peritransplant he devloped a multifocal PNA of unclear etiology. Pretransplant imaging showed peribronchial thickening, and post transplant a tree &amp; bud appearance with more focal areas of consolidation. Per the patient, he had a dry hacking cough with occaisional fevers and night sweats that lasted from April through November of 73 and resolved on their own.  He had several courses of quinolones (and other abx) during this period without significant relief, but ultimately his symptoms improved on their own.  His immune suppression was d/c'd 7/74.  He deveoloped iron overload (Ferritin 1356) and started phlebotomy 9/74.   \n\n\nMr. Ware did well from a respiratory standpoint until 11/74 when he noticed intermittent fevers approximately every 2 weeks.   At first they were in the 99 range and they would last 1-2days and be associated with malaise.  He also again experienced symptoms of a dry hacking cough that occurs with change in positioning (not necessarily lying flat).  By the end of November, the fevers were a bit higher (100.5).  He saw his PCP who thought he might have PNA.  He obtained a CXR and gave hime a course ofr azithromycin (5d). His fevers improved.  In early December, he began experienceing SOB with exertional dyspnea.  He saw his PCP again who rx avelox.  He got another CXR which showed some \"fluid\" and was strated on lasix.  He was also referred for echocardiogram, PFTs, and chest CT.  On arrival, he was found to be in AFB w/RVR. \n\n\nHe was admitted from 12/21-01/02. He was rate controlled and had minimal diuresis.  Cardiac MRI suggested constrictive pericarditis and possible areas of active pericarditis.  Right &amp; left heart cath which showed no evidence of cosntriction hemodynamically. He had 1 temperature to 101.4, and given his history he was seen by our service.  Blood cultures were negative. Induced sputum was negative for AFB x 3. He and influenza/rsv/paraflu/adnevorus nasal swabs which were also negative. Sputum cultures grew oral flora. CMV VL, glucan, and galactomannan were also negative. \n\n\nHe improved w/regard to SOB but cough persisted.  He was seen by Dr. Vann who was concerned for an immunologic process given his bilateral pleural effusions &amp; question of pericarditis. He had a URI syndrome in January that lasted 3 weeks then resolved.  On February 19th, he noticed the onset of low-grade temps (100.0-100.5) with malaise and mild chills.  These happened nightly through. He saw his PCP 2/23 who rx moxifloxacin. He had no change in his symptoms.  He had some mild rhinorrhea and mildly increased SOB.  He denies CP, abdominal pain, HA, N/V/D, joint pain, skin rashes, dysuria.  His son had a \"head cold\" prior to the onset of his symptoms.  No other sick contacts.

Our\n\nplan was to give adenosine, however, during the IV placement. \n\nPrior to giving adenosine, the patient converted to a normal\n\nsinus rhythm with mild tachycardia at around 100, but it was\n\nclear that there was T waves.  At this point, we decided to give\n\nher baseline metoprolol dose and she missed two doses.\n\nLABORATORY DATA:  Labs checked include sodium of 139, potassium\n\n3.7, chloride 104, bicarbonate 23, BUN 14, creatinine 0.81,\n\nglucose 268.  ALT 19, AST 18, CK 350, alkaline phosphatase 128,\n\ntotal bilirubin 0.5, CK-MB 5.2, troponin I less than 0.04,\n\ncalcium 9.1, and mag 1.9.  White blood cells 10.29, hematocrit\n\n42.7, and platelets 438, 000.  INR is 1.  UA is negative for\n\ninfection with trace blood present.\n\nPLAN:  Our plan is to check two more enzymes because the patient\n\nhad the left arm heaviness during the palpitations.  If both of\n\nthose enzymes are negative, we feel that she is safe to go home\n\nfrom the ED Observation Unit.  It is unclear the etiology of her\n\narrhythmia.  It did seem to be likely SVT, which broke\n\nspontaneously.  The patient is to follow up with her primary\n\ndoctor.\n\nDISPOSITION:  ED Observation Unit.\n\nCONDITION ON DISCHARGE:  Satisfactory.\n\nI confirm that I have interviewed and examined the patient,\n\nreviewed the resident's documentation, the patient's chart,\n\ndiscussed the evaluation, plan of care, and disposition with the\n\npatient.\n\n______________________________\n\nMARTIN, CONSTANCE M.D.\n\nD: 12/15/90\n\nT: 12/15/90\n\nDictated By: MARTIN, CONSTANCE\n\neScription document:8-4109370 BFFocus\n\n ******** Not reviewed by Attending Physician ********"}

Briefly, he was admitted 6/20/62 with DKA and MSSA bacteremia.  He was found to have perirectal abscess s/p CT-guided drains as well as L hip infected prosthesis and abscess s/p removal and drainage in OR on 7/07 and by IR 7/22, both sites positive for MSSA.  Hospital course c/b GIB and was found to have free air with perforated duodenum s/p ex-lap 6/22, gastrectomy with partial large bowel resection, splenectomy and primary anastamosis, with path positive for mucormycosis without clean margins.  He also had VRE/klebsiella LUQ abscess s/p IR drainage.  \n\nHe was initially treated with nafcillin and ambisome, but developed maculopapular rash on chest and arms thought to be secondary to nafcillin.  So he was switched to vanco/ambisome/linezolid/meropenem/amikacin for LUQ abscess.  After 6 weeks of high-dose ambisome, he was taken back to OR on 7/31 for re-exploration and was found to have some more necrosis around his esophageal-jejunostomy site that surgeons \"scooped out\" as much as they could, but were not able to get clean margins because of difficult anatomic restrictions. \nGiven the inability to completely en-bloc resect Mr. Ethridge's GI mucor despite a long-trial of Ambisome, he was started on an investigational drug, posaconazole, provided by Emcor on a compassionate use basis.  This has had 50% success of curing mucor as salvage therapy in small trials.  He was started on this drug on 8/28/62 and has tolerated it well despite some nausea, diarrhea.  \n\nHe has been at EDUCARE-FARGO reports increase in strength and improved ability to bear weight on his hip.  He walks with a walker.  He had repeat CT abd/pelvix 10/26 which showed no intraabdominal collection and stable L hip collection.  He had abd drains removed 3 weeks ago but continues to have L hip drain, without much output.  He was started on TPN 1 week ago due to maltrition, despite po intake.  He has been trying to eat, but reports some nausea and diarrhea, especially after he eats and since starting posaconazole.  He reports good glycemic control.

He is very slowly improving in terms of strength, no doubt in part due to nocturnal TPN.  Hard to tease out the cause of his nausea, although anatomic reasons are as likely as medication side effects.  On balance, if his labs are ok, I'd favor continuing the posaconazole given most recent OR findings.  ECG without QTc prolongation.  Abdomen is bening.  Left hip still sore, but more and more stable.  \n\n\n\nBrandon Gaines, MD\nRecord date: 2064-01-08\n\n \n\nInternal Medicine - Team 3 Intern Admit Note\n\n\n\nPatient Name: \tEthridge, Clayton\n\nMedical Record #: \t8381729\n\nDate of Admission: \t01/08/64\nAttending: \t\tDr. Burton\n\n\n\nCC/ID:\tclotted AV fistula / renal failure\n\n\n\nHPI: \tThe patient is a 55 year old male with a past medical history significant for chronic renal failure (secondary to diabetes & hypertension) and gastrointestinal mucormycosis who underwent an arteriovenous graft placement ten days prior to admission. The patient was doing well until a few days prior to admission when he noticed a swelling in his new graft and a decrease in the degree of its pulse. Then on the morning of admission when he noticed his graft was without a palpable pulse or thrill. The patient then presented to the EDUCARE-PULLMAN ER for evaluation and treatment. \n\n\n\n\tIn the ER, the patient was found to have an engorged AV graft without dopplerable pulse or bruit. The patient was seen by surgery and an ultrasound of the upper extremity revealed a clotted graft and so the patient was admitted to the medical service for further evaluation and treatment.\n\n\n\nOf note, the patient denies any pain  / numbness / coolness in his hand. He further denies any shortness of breath, increased swelling in his legs, or changes in his weight. He does indicate that he has suffered from decreased oral intake lately secondary to feeling tired and having a decreased appetite.\n\n\n\nPMH: \tDiabetes mellitus\n\nDiabetic neuropathy\n\nHypertension\t\t\n\nChronic renal disease\t\t- secondary to diabetes & hypertension, baseline Cr 4\n\nAnemia\t\t\t\t- baseline hematocrit mid 30s\n\nGastrointestinal mucormycosis\t- s/p GI surgery (see below)\n\n\n\nPSH: \tHip replacement\n\nTotal gastrectomy, gastroesophagojejunostomy, distal pancreatectomy, transverse colectomy\n\nSplenectomy\n\nLeft total hip replacement\n\n\n\nAllergies:  \tNafcillin - rash\n\n\n\nSH:  \tPatient lives in Kemmerer at the Chestnut Lodge Sanitarium.

The patient has a history of multiple problems with access (clots, stenoses), requiring frequent thrombectomies and revisions.   The patient first noticed a problem on July 23, and by the 24th he said that \"the access had collapsed.\" On July 25, interventional radiology attempted to thrombectomize the clot, with no success, requiring placement of a new tunneled catheter in left IJ to allow dialysis.  At present, patient is on the OR waiting list for tomorrow, for thrombectomy/revision.  \n\n\n\nOf note, patient was admitted in April of 2064 after a nurse at the McLaren Hospital detected a new cardiac murmur.  Pt was found to have a RA thrombus by echo, presumed to be a complication from a prior catheter, started on a heparin gtt and transitioned to coumadin.  \n\n\n\nROS: No fever/chills, HA, SOB, CP, N/V/D (though states that stomach sometimes \"sensitive\").\n\n\n\nPast Medical History: \n\nDM - Type 2\n\nHTN\n\nESRD on HD MWF, with h/o multiple problems with access, Cr baseline 4\n\ns/p extensive bowel resection for mucormycosis, June 2062 (gastrectomy, esophagojejunostomy, splenectomy, distal pancreatectomy, segmental transverse colectomy)\t\n\ns/p L THR    s/p resection arthroplasty of left femoral head and acetabulum for fungal infection (mucomycosis above, June 2062)\n\nR atrial thrombus by echo in 4/63\n\n\n\n\n\nAllergies: \n\nNafcillin- rash\n\nPenicillin- rash\n\n\n\nMedications (upon admission)\n\n      Remeron (MIRTAZAPINE)   15 MG (15MG TABLET take 1) PO QHS \n\n      Nexium (ESOMEPRAZOLE)   20 MG (20MG CAPSULE DR take 1) PO QD \n\n      TRAZODONE   50 MG (50MG TABLET take 1) PO QHS \n\n      Colace (DOCUSATE Sodium)   100 MG (100MG TABLET take 1) PO TID \n\n      Norvasc (AMLODIPINE)   10 MG (10MG TABLET take 1) PO QD \n\n      Diovan (VALSARTAN)   80 MG (80MG TABLET take 1) PO QD \n\n      Insulin Regular Human   SC  \n\n      NEPHROCAPS   1 CAPSULE PO QD \n\n      Renagel (SEVELAMER)   806 MG (403MG CAPSULE take 2) PO TID \n\n      Folate (FOLIC Acid)   1 MG (1MG TABLET take 1) PO QD \n\n      Calcium Carbonate (500 Mg Elemental Ca++)   1250 MG PO AC \n\n      Warfarin Sodium   2.5 MG (2.5MG TABLET take 1) PO QPM\n\n\n\nSocial History:  Patient is a native of Kazakhstan, who moved to the UKRAINE to study Electrical Mechanics at OpenMarket Inc.

The patient did not, however, present to the Internal Medicine as \nplanned.  She states that she has been \"too busy.\"  Her only complaint \ntoday is of some right leg pain, which she says is chronic and which is \nrelieved to some extent by acetaminophen.  \n \nEva continues to take Procardia XL 30 mg. PO q.day.  A noted in her \nambulatory record, the Procardia is prescribed as a b.i.d. drug, however, \nEva believes it gives her headaches and refuses to take it other than \non an almost p.r.n. basis.  \n \nReview of systems is essentially normal.  Specifically, she denies any \nheadaches, any chest pain, any shortness of breath.  She also denies any \nsymptoms or signs referable to her urinary tract.  She has no history of \ndysuria, of frequent urinary tract infection, or of hematuria.\n \nPhysical Examination:  She is robust appearing.  Vital signs are \nsignificant for a blood pressure of 140/100.  HEENT exam is unremarkable.  \nLungs are clear.  Cardiac exam reveals a regular rate and rhythm, a normal \nS1, S2.  No S3 is appreciated.  There are no murmurs or rubs.  Abdomen is \nslightly obese, nontender, and with normal bowel sounds.  No masses are \nappreciated.  Lower extremities are without edema and joint exam does not \nsuggest effusion or limitation of her range of motion.  Indeed, exam of \nher legs is entirely unremarkable.  \n \nLaboratory:  Will include a repeat creatinine, a urinalysis and urine \nsediment and a urine creatinine.\n \nAssessment and Plan:\n \n1.   Hypertension:  Eva has had persistently elevated blood pressure \n     on her Procardia.  I have asked her to stop taking Procardia, which \n     she blames for headaches and to begin taking taking atenolol, \n     beginning at 50 mg. PO q.day.  I will see her in a few days in order \n     to make sure that she is not having any difficulties with this drug \n     and also to check her blood pressure once again.\n \n2.   Right leg pain:  This would appear to be chronic and may well be \n     related to her work, which requires her to scuttle throughout the \n     hospital at fairly high speed (She is a Pulping Control Operator.)  I  have asked her to continue taking \n     Tylenol and we will re-evaluate her need for more powerful agents, \n     such as nonsteroidals if the need arises.\nPROMPTCARE INTERNAL MEDICINE ASSOCIATES          Rutledge, Eva\nPage 2                                        29195561\n                                              6-19-59\n \n \n \n3.   Elevated creatinine:  Unfortunately, Eva has not kept her Renal \n     appointment.  In order to prevent this from recurring a third time, I \n     have called and made an appointment for her with Dr. Eileen Xayavong.  \n     She is to see him on the 29th of this month at 1:00 p.m. and I have \n     also left a message on his E mail mentioning Eva to him.  \n     Hopefully, he can help ultrasound identify the etiology of this \n     elevated creatinine before there is further loss of her kidney \n     function.  \n \n4.   Health Maintenance:  The patient was scheduled to have a Pap smear \n     today, but again was \"too busy to stay that long.\"  She is to see me \n     again shortly, and a Pap smear will be done at that time.  Her \n     February mammogram was essentially not suggestive of malignancy and \n     will not be repeated until next year.  \n \n \n \n \n_________________________\nUlysses Quijano, M.D.\n \nTD:PX:4740\nDD:6-20-59\nDT:6-19-59\nDV:6-19-59\n ******** Approved but not reviewed by Attending Provider ********\nRecord date: 2066-10-08\n\n                                                       Patient Name: RUTLEDGE,EVA [ MRN: 37947241ZGJ ]\n\n                                                         Date of Visit: 10/08/2066\n\n\n                                      PROMPTCAREIMA Clinic Note\n\n\n\nMrs. Rutledge is a former patient of Dr. Xia's who comes in today to establish a new PCP and for follow-up of her hypertension, diabetes, chronic renal insufficiency (baseline creatinine 2.2), and GERD.  She is currently on procardia xl, losartan, and atenolol for her hypertension.  She takes a baby aspirin qd for cardiac protection.  Her diabetes is controlled by diet alone, and her GERD by zantac 150 qd or bid prn.  Her last HbA1C was 6.9, with a malb/cr ratio of 222.2 and trace protein on U/A.  She has had a prior cardiac work-up for atypical chest pain with a negative ETT/SPECT in 2062 and a negative ETT in 2064.  An echo in 2062 showed an EF of 65% with no valvular abnormalities.\n\n\n\nShe is currently well with no complaints.  She is being followed in opthalmology for possible glaucoma.  She does not check her blood sugars at home, although she has a glucometer.  When asked if her sugars are ever low, she states that she has the same symptoms with hypoglycemia that she does with hyperglycemia: dizziness and hot flashes.  She's not had this recently.  She also does not check her BP at home.  She denies any numbness or tingling in her fingers, or any chest pain.  She did pull a muscle in her shoulder last night and still feels tender in that area.  She follows a diabetic diet (avoids sweets), gets no regular exercise, but works in Electrical and Avionics Mechanics so does have physical activity during the day.\n\n\n\nPSHx: none\n\nPGynHx: G7 P4 SAB1 TAB2, still menstruating q month, no hot flashes, heavy periods but no clots; LMP 10/01/66\n\nAllergies: NKAD\n\nHabits: never smoked, very rare EtOH, no illicit drugs\n\n\n\nMedications:\n\nASA  81MG PO QD\n\nATENOLOL  100MG PO QD  (she has run out of this and did not take it today)\n\nPROCARDIA XL  30MG PO QD\n\nRANITIDINE HCL   150MG PO QD\n\nLOSARTAN  50MG PO 2 qd\n\n\n\nPhysical Exam\t\n\n================ Vital signs ================\n\n Blood Pressure:  --  136/76\n\n Pulse:  --  76\n\nWeight:  --  139  [Pounds]\n\nGeneral:  no acute distress\n\nHEENT:   PERLA, anicteric, O/P clear\n\nNeck:      no thyromegaly or LAN; no carotid bruits\n\nChest:     lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally with no crackles \n\nHeart:      regular rate and rhythm, S1 and S2 normal, no m/g/r  \n\nAbd:        soft, NT/ND.  +BS.

Diabetes.  Checking A1C off medication.  Would like to have patient check FS when she's feeling ill or if A1C is elevated.  Will refer to NP for review glucometer use, diabetic diet.  She has been tried on glucotrol XL in the past and was hypoglycemia.  This is also probably not a good choice due to her renal insufficiency.  May try glyburide if A1C elevated.  Being followed by opthalmology with upcoming appt.  Podiatry referral deferred.  Consider repeat referral to nutrition.  Lipids very good (LDL 82) last check off medication.\n\n2.  Hypertension.  BP borderline elevated today, but off atenolol.  HR also up.  Refilled all meds; will ask NP to check her pressure at next visit.  Will continue qd ASA for CAD/stroke prevention.\n\n3.  GERD.  Continue zantac bid as needed.  Also recommended that patient start using Tums for calcium supplementation and relief of intermittent dyspepsia.  She will try this and get back to me about the effect.\n\n4.  Chronic renal insufficiency.  Will get 24-hour urine to assess creatinine clearance and urine protein.  Checking chem 7 today for K and Creatinine.\n\n5.  Health maintenance.  Patient due to dT shot, requested today.  Normal mammogram in 5/66.

Trujillo, M.D.\n\nDepartment of Vascular Surgery\n\nLenox Care Center\n\n21 Tamworth Place\n\nGalena, MN  64864\n\n \n\nDear Dr. Trujillo:\n\n \n\nThank you for referring Mrs. Shirley Trent, a 68-year-old lady\n\nwith peripheral artery disease, on whom you plan to do\n\nrevascularization of the right leg.  Her history is well known to\n\nyou but I will repeat it for our records.  She has a long history\n\nof cigarette smoking with a 3-packet-per-day history for 30\n\nyears, stopping 15 years ago.  She has developed claudication,\n\nparticularly in the right leg, over the last year since her\n\nhusband died, which has all the typical symptoms and is relieved\n\nby rest.  This seems predominantly in the right calf but is also\n\nin the right thigh as well.  She had segmental leg pressures done\n\nwhich shows some mild diminution in the left leg but an\n\nankle-brachial index of 0.65 in the right leg.  An MR angiogram\n\nshowed stenosis, although I do not have the full report on this\n\nas yet.\n\n \n\nShe has intercurrent problems with insulin-dependent diabetes\n\nmellitus, which she has had for 10 years.  Her other cardiac risk\n\nfactors apart from cigarette smoking include a family history of\n\nmyocardial infarction in her father, and it is uncertain what her\n\ncholesterol level is.  She has no history of hypertension,\n\nalthough I am uncertain whether this has been checked in the\n\npast.  She has a past history of partial gastrectomy in 2059 for\n\na bleeding peptic ulcer and this has led to some difficulty in\n\nswallowing tablets and keeping them down.  She also has a past\n\nhistory of a right middle lobectomy in 2079 for adenocarcinoma\n\nthat had clear margins and did not require further adjunctive\n\ntherapy.  She also had a cholecystectomy in 2079, which was\n\nuneventful.\n\n \n\nSystems review reveal no chest discomfort, dyspnea, ankle edema,\n\npalpitations, syncope, cough, sputum, hemoptysis, GI bleeding,\n\nweakness down the arms, face, or legs, seizures or visual\n\ndisturbances, and all other systems are negative.\n\n \n\nShe lives alone, and her current medications include insulin\n\nonly.  She has no allergies.\n\n \n\nOn physical examination, she is alert and orientated without any\n\nsigns of jaundice, clubbing, or cyanosis.  Her heart rate was 85\n\nbeats per minute with a blood pressure of 160/85 in both arms. \n\nThe jugular venous pressure was not elevated, and her carotid\n\nupstrokes were reduced, but she had no bruits audible.  Her apex\n\nbeat was not palpable, and she had a normal first and second\n\nheart sound without added sounds, murmurs, or gallops.  Her chest\n\nwas clear to percussion and auscultation.  She had no\n\nhepatosplenomegaly and no abdominal masses or pulsations.  She\n\nhad the scars from previous operations present.  Her femoral\n\npulses were absent on the right side and reduced on the left side\n\nwithout bruits.  She had reduced but palpable dorsalis pedis and\n\nposterior tibial pulses on the left leg but no pedal pulses on\n\nthe right leg.  There were no trophic changes in her legs.  She\n\nhad reduced sensation to pinprick in both feet to the mid calf\n\nlevel in a stocking distribution.\n\n \n\nHer ECG showed sinus rhythm without abnormalities.\n\n \n\nAssessment:  This lady obviously has severe claudication and\n\nrequires revascularization, but is uncertain whether she has any\n\nmyocardial ischemia.  I therefore think a stress test is\n\nrequired.  She also has difficulty in swallowing medications and\n\nthis will prove a problem for the long-term management of her\n\natherosclerosis, which I would like to further evaluate.\n\n \n\nPlan:  I therefore organized a dobutamine stress test to assess\n\nfor myocardial ischemia and cardiovascular risk.  I have also\n\nasked her to start on a small dose of a beta-blocker for reducing\n\nher perioperative risk as well as treating her blood pressure,\n\nwhich is elevated.  I have also asked her to have a fasting blood\n\nlipid test today so we can assess her cholesterol level, as it is\n\nlikely that she would benefit from lipid-lowering therapy.  I\n\nplan to evaluate all these in approximately a month or so after\n\nher operation so that we can manage her in the long term.\n\n \n\nI will let you know the results of her stress test when they\n\nbecome available.  Thank you for allowing me to take part in this\n\nlady's care.\n\n \n\nYours sincerely,\n\n \n\nDictated By: James Patel\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n______________________________\n\nJames Patel, MBBS, PHD\n\n \n\n \n\neScription document:8-6022994 TFFocus\n\n \n\n \n\nCC: Rose Samuel Isaac-Ly M.D.\n\nInternal Medicine\n\n20 Tamworth Place\n\nGalena, MN 64864\n\n \n\nDD: 09/21/92\n\nDT: 09/21/92\n\nDV: 09/21/92\n\n ******** Not reviewed by Attending Physician ********\nRecord date: 2093-06-12\n\n\nDutch\n19 Tamworth Place                                        TRENT, SHIRLEY\nGalena, MN 64864                                      99210914\n(676) 312-7662                                           06/12/93\n\n\nHISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Ms. Trent is 69, a pleasant lady who is now a widow well known to me for her insulin-dependent diabetes and her poor compliance with treatment.  In the past, she also has experienced upper GI bleeding due to a peptic ulcer and has undergone cholecystectomy as well as lobectomy for carcinoma of the lung.\n\nCURRENT MEDICATIONS:  Humulin N 25 units in the morning.  She is supposed to be using 28 units in the morning and 8 units in the evening depending on blood sugars.  She also has been prescribed an ACE inhibitor and a beta blocker, which she has neglected to take.  Her last visit to the practice was in September of last year.\n\nAt the time of her last visit, I referred to vascular surgery because of claudication of the right leg.  She underwent a femoral public TL bypass in December and did well postoperatively.  She was discharged on simvastatin, Plavix, as well as atenolol and lisinopril.  She abandoned all tablets on her own and did not come for her followup appointment with us.  Today, she tells me that claudication in the right leg has disappeared completely but during the past two months, she has begun noticing pain in the left leg after 10-15 minutes of walking which forces her to stop.  An arteriogram carried out in September of last year showed mild diffuse disease involving the left common iliac, external iliac, and common femoral arteries.  She did not have symptoms on the left side at the time.\n\nThe patient denies chest pain, palpitation, shortness of breath, orthopnea, and ankle edema.  Prior to her bypass surgery on the right leg, she underwent a Persantine MIBI which showed only 1 mm ST depressions and was considered not diagnostic.\n\nMs. Trent has experienced some polyuria and mild polydipsia and has two times nocturia.  She denies dysuria.  The last hemoglobin A1c was 8.4 in September of last year.  At that time, her serum cholesterol was 238, HDL was 59, and triglycerides were 263.\n\nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Today, she is pleasant and talkative.  Her weight is 127-1/2 pounds, blood pressure 180/76, and heart rate is 96.  Oxygen saturation 100% on room air.  Random fingerstick glucose is 202.  Extraocular movements are full.  The thyroid is not enlarged.  The neck veins are flat.  The chest is clear to auscultation.  The breasts are free of masses.  There is no axillary lymphadenopathy.  The heart sounds are regular.  There are no rubs or gallops.  There is a midline abdominal scar which corresponds to an old operation for peptic ulcer.  There is also a right upper quadrant cholecystectomy scar which is surrounded by a mass, which has been present in the past that probably represents fibrosis under the scar.  No other masses are palpable.  The lower extremities are free of edema.  I do not palpate the pulse except in the dorsalis pedis area of the right side, but there are no trophic changes and the skin is warm and pink.\n\nASSESSMENT AND PLAN:  A 69-year-old widow lady with moderately controlled insulin-dependent diabetes and hyperlipidemia.  She has not been compliant with her medications.  She has suffered from peripheral vascular disease and claudication in the past underwent a bypass surgery on the right lower extremity in October of last year.  She now has mild symptoms of claudication on the left.  She continues to consume three or four beers a day.  The relationship to her vascular atherosclerosis is not clear.  Liver function in the past has been normal and she does not have significant proteinuria.  Today, I have repeated her hemoglobin A1c, comprehensive panel, CBC, and urine analysis.  I have spent 20 minutes speaking to her and to her daughter concerning the importance of compliance and explaining the rationale for the lisinopril.  I have prescribed Lipitor 10 mg p.o. q.d., lisinopril 10 mg p.o. q.d., and enteric-coated aspirin 81 mg p.o. q.d. She is also to take a multivitamin q.d.  I will see her again after the above test results to decide whether we need to adjust her medications.  I have increased her insulin to 28 units every morning.  She will come to see the nurse practitioner in three days' time to learn how to use a glucometer and to review diabetes care.  An electrocardiogram will be obtained and a consultation will be arranged with vascular surgery concerning the claudication now on the left leg.\n\n\n\n\n\n______________________________\nRose Irvin-Ly, M.D.\n\n\nDictated By: Rose Irvin-Ly\n\n\neScription document:0-2524422 EMSSten Tel\n\n\n\nDD: 06/12/93\nDT: 06/13/93\nDV: 06/12/93\nRecord date: 2093-11-24\n\n\n\nHistory of Present Illness\n\nAsked by Dr. Trujillo to comment on diabetes management for this patient.

The patient's grand-nephew is translating, initially, then joined by Dutch interpreter; history is challenging to obtain.  The patient reports that since she awoke in the AM on 12/07/94, she noticed that her RUE and RLE was weak and numb.  She apparently had come to the ED about 2 days ago for RLE numbness and pain which has been worsening over the past 1-2 months, but reportedly had good strength on neurological exam, and she was not admitted.  She was given  a 2-day course of Levaquin for UTI.  She states that despite the pain in the RLE 2 days ago, she was able to move her RLE whereas since yesterday she has not been able to move it as easily or bear weight.  She also noted that her RUE was weak, and she was unable to raise it very far off the bed.  She was unable to walk independently since yesterday, and required full assistance of her son to walk to the bathroom.  She has had no facial weakness.  She has never had weakness of this kind in her right arm or leg, but had similar weakness in the left arm and leg in 2089 which completely resolved.  She states that she has had a mild right-sided headache since yesterday AM.  Since this morning, she has had nausea and vomiting as well (did not have this yesterday), and has not had any fevers or chest pain.  She has had SOB today. She reports having frequent BLE spasms, usually at night, and her legs become quite restless.\n\n\n\nROS:  \n\nGen:  No fevers/chills/sweats, CP, palpitations, N/V, URI, cough, abd pain, dysuria, melena, BRBPR, rash, travel\n\n\n\nNeurological:  Recent RLE pain as above.

She has had numbness/tingling and shooting pain in the RLE for the past 1-2 months likely due  to disease in the lumbar spine seen on MRI (L5-S1).  She states that the current weakness in the RLE is new, as is the weakness in the RUE.  Additionally, she has new nausea/vomiting and SOB since this AM.  While in the ED, following her CT scans, she was tachycardic to the 150s and hypertensive to the 230s systolic.  She had persistent nausea and vomiting.  \n\n\n\nHer neurological exam was difficult with inconsistent findings.  She appears to have decreased spontaneous movement of the RUE, but when passively moved into shoulder flexion she was able to hold the position against gravity for several seconds.  Her RLE symptoms are likely confounded by her lumbar spine disease at L5/S1 as noted above.  She is hyperglycemic (serum glucose 313), has a mild leukocytosis, is iron deficient, and has new onset today of fairly severe nausea/vomiting and SOB of unclear etiology.  She appears to have vasculopathic changes/lacunes in the brain seen as hypodensities on the CT today, all appearing old.  She does not have any right facial weakness, no dysarthria, no aphasia, no flaccidity/spasticity, no gaze preference.  While stroke can not be ruled out, her exam does not clearly suggest a typical stroke syndrome.  Ddx includes seizure, infection or metabolic abnormality causing unmasking of stroke-like symptoms, migraine phenomena superimposed on current medical/metabolic abnormalities.\n\n\n\n\n\nRECOMMENDATIONS:\n\n1.\tMRI/MRA of the head and neck (stroke protocol), as well as MRI of C-spine given UE symptoms\n\n2.\tWe currently recommend admission to medicine given multiple medical issues (severe HTN, SOB as yet unexplained, N/V, hyperglycemia).\n\n3.\tBP control:  Labetolol to maintain BP less than 200 systolic; avoid large/rapid shifts to maintain cerebral perfusion pressure.  Would allow some degree of hypertension (max 200 SBP) until stroke protocol MRI/MRA obtained.\n\n4.\tGlycemic control-need to clarify home insulin regimen\n\n5.\tResend cardiac markers in setting of tachycardia to 150s\n\n6.\tF/u PE protocol CT (done in ED).\n\n7.\tPatient will be followed by the Neurology consult service.\n\n\n\nThis case was discussed with Dr. James Rosado MD, senior Neurology resident.\n\n\n\n\n\n________________________________\n\nAlex Waters, MD\n\nResident in Neurology\n\nPager #45445\nRecord date: 2096-02-22\n\n \n\n\n\n\nRE: TRENT, SHIRLEY\nLCC #99210914\n02/22/2096\n\n\nXitlalic Pearson, M.D.\nMartha Washington Hospital\n617 Comanche Street\nMilbank, MN 49757   \n\n\nDear Dr. Pearson: \n\nI had the pleasure of seeing Mrs. Shirley Trent in follow up this morning. Mrs. Trent is a 71 year-old right-handed woman with a history of a left corona radiata stroke in December 2094 complicated by a dense right hemiparesis. She presented today with her granddaughter, Ms. Carey Trent. Ms. Trent translated and provided supplemental interval history.\n\nInterval History\nMrs. Trent moved to the Eddie Bauer Nursing home approximately one month ago. She has continued to have a dense paresis of the right arm and leg, which has confined her to a wheelchair. She has had spasticity, in particular of the right leg, that has been painful at times and has contributed to sleeping difficulties. Baclofen was initiated and titrated to 20 mg TID, with some efficacy. According to Carey, another medication may have been used around the turn of the year. Gabapentin was initiated at a dose of 100 mg HS on 2/10/96. \n\nMrs. Trent related that she has had a depressed mood in recent months. A son with whom she was close died in August of last year from complications following an admission to the hospital with asthma. This was extremely difficult for Mrs. Trent. She has felt \"alone,\" but has enjoyed visits to the nursing home from Carey and from Carey's aunt, one of Mrs. Trent's daughters. Her other children have not maintained close contact.   \n\nMrs. Trent had increased weakness and slurring of her speech in early February, which may have been related to a urinary tract infection or sedating medication used at that time. Aside from that episode, Mrs. Trent reported no episodes of weakness, numbness, clumsiness, visual changes, slurred speech, dizziness, language difficulties, or other neurological symptoms concerning for stroke since her stroke in December 2094. \n\nPast Medical History\ntype 2 diabetes mellitus requiring insulin\nh/o peptic ulcer disease with GI bleeding \nhyperlipidemia \nperipheral arterial disease, bypass surgery on the right leg, mild symptoms of claudication on the left\nleft internal carotid artery stenosis\n\nMedications (confirmed)\nBaclofen 20 MG (10MG TABLET take 2) PO TID \nClopidogrel 75 MG (75MG TABLET take 1) PO QD \nGabapentin 100 MG (100MG CAPSULE take 1) PO QHS \nMetoclopramide HCL 10 MG (10MG TABLET take 1) PO AC \nMirtazapine 30 MG (30MG TABLET take 1) PO QHS \nMultivitamin WITH FOLIC ACID (MULTIVITAMINS) 1 TAB PO QD x 60 days\nNovolog (INSULIN ASPART) SC QAM, QPM and SS \nOmeprazole 20 MG (20MG CAPSULE DR take 1) PO QD \nToprol XL (METOPROLOL SUCCINATE EXTENDED RELEASE) 100 MG (100MG TAB.SR 24H take 1) PO QD \n\nAllergies\nNKA \n\nSocial History\nMrs. Trent is originally from Suriname. She is widowed, with six living children. A son died at age 42 in August, 2095. Mrs. Trent has a remote history of smoking. She does not consume alcohol. She has recently spent much of her time watching television (like soap operas in Dutch) and participating in group activities (such as Bingo) at the home.  \n\nReview of Systems\nNegative for chest pain, shortness of breath, visual changes, weakness, numbness, burning pain, paresthesias, difficulties speaking or understanding others, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, pain or burning on urination. Positive for frequent nighttime awakening. Appetite has been \"o.k.\"\n\nExam\nBlood Pressure 128/58     Heart Rate 76\nNeck: no carotid bruits\nLungs: CTA bilaterally\nHeart: regular rate and rhythm, II/VI systolic ejection murmur\nABD: soft, nontender, nondistended, bowel sounds present\nEXT: no edema\nMS: alert, pleasant, cooperative, good eye contact. Fatigued, mildly depressed looking affect. Oriented to \"LCC\" in \"Galena,\" \"March 2095.\" Speech fluent in Dutch. Followed 2-step verbal commands with left hand. Recalled recent events from soap opera episodes in detail. \nCN: pupils 4mm, round, LR to 2mm. EOMI. Mild right UMN facial weakness. Palate elevation symmetrical and tongue protrusion midline.\nMOTOR: increased tone with clasp knife phenomenon right arm and leg. Minimal movement of right arm (elbow flexion, index finger extension, finger flexion) and right foot (knee flexion, ankle flexion, toe extension). 5/5 strength in proximal and distal muscles of the left arm and leg. \nSENSORY: reduced sensation to temperature and vibration right arm and leg relative to the left. \nDTRs: 3 in the right biceps, BR, triceps, 2 on the left. Trace patellar and ankle reflexes bilaterally. Right plantar response extensor, left flexor.\nCEREB: no dysmetria left finger nose finger. \n\nMRI brain 12/10/94: small-to-medium sized stroke in the left corona radiata \n\nCTA head and neck 12/11/94: dense calcification at the carotid bifurcation, precluding a legitimate interpretation.\n\nCNIS 12/14/94: demonstrated 25 to 49% stenosis in the proximal left ICA; velocity of 143 in the proximal ICA versus 50 in the distal CCA suggests a possible moderate (50-70%) stenosis of the vessel\n\nEchocardiogram (transthoracic) 12/14/94: estimated EF of 55 to 60%, no regional wall motion abnormalities, mild left atrial enlargement, and no other significant abnormalities.\n\nImpression\nMrs. Shirley Trent is a 71 year-old right-handed woman who had a stroke in the left corona radiata in December 2094. Her stroke risk factors include history of diabetes mellitus, dyslipidemia, peripheral arterial disease, and left carotid stenosis with a calcified plaque. She has not had any clinical events suggestive of stroke in the interim between 11/94 and now. Mrs. Trent's current neurological and psychiatric problems include spasticity of the right arm and leg and depression. \n\nPlan\n1. We will obtain repeat carotid studies to assess for interval progression of the left carotid stenosis.\n2. We recommend continued management of vascular risk factors, with (1) target BP 120/80 or less, (2) target LDL < 100, (3) continued glycemic control. Continue clopidogrel as an antiplatelet agent.\n3. Regarding the spasticity, it is reasonable to utilize a higher evening dose of gabapentin and assess the efficacy. Other potential agents to consider for future use include cyclobenzaprine, tizanidine, and trihexyphenidyl. I will continue to follow and would be happy to discuss this management with you at any time. \n4. I agree with mirtazapine for antidepressant therapy given Mrs. Trent's poor appetite and impaired sleep. After her gabapentin has been appropriately titrated, one may consider increasing mirtazapine to 45 mg HS.\n5. Mrs. Trent will be scheduled for follow up in approximately 6 months.\n\nIt is a pleasure to participate in the care of Mrs. Trent with you. Greater than 50% of this 60 minute follow up visit was spent counseling regarding the above issues. Please do not hesitate to contact me with questions.\n\n\nSincerely,\n\n\n______________________________\nJames Rosado, M.D.\nNeurology\nLenox Care Center\n\n\n\ncc:\nMs. Carey Trent\n45 Hoyts Lane, Qpt. 0\nGalena, MN 64864"}

Dr. Rodriquez is a 77-year-old retired Electrician\nat Wells Fargo who by his report has enjoyed excellent\nhealth until the past year. He denies any prior history of\nhypertension, coronary artery disease, chest pains, significant\nchildhood illnesses or malignancy. He describes his usual baseline\nhealth as excellent. He is a religious walker, walking multiple\ntimes each week as well as a woodwind and singing enthusiast. Dr.\nRodriquez states that in approximately April or Mayof the past year he\nwas first diagnosed with hyperglycemia. This was treated with\nMetformin. Subsequently Hydrochlorothiazide and Zestril were added\napparently for hypertension (although the patient does not believe\nhe has been diagnosed with hypertension). He subsequently developed\ndiarrhea which he felt was related to Glucophage which was\nsubsequently reduced in dose. In June of the past year the patient\nwas noted to be anemic which was felt to be related to sulfa in his\nHydrochlorothiazide. At that time he also was found to have lower\nextremity edema which worsened with the discontinuation of the\nHydrochlorothiazide. The patient states in September of 2119 he\ntraveled to trinidad and tobago. While in trinidad and tobago he had a\nmarked increase in his lower extremity edema to the point that he\nfound it difficult to ambulate. He denied any difficulty with chest\npains or shortness of breath. He had no hemoptysis and no focal\nunilateral leg swelling despite the long period of immobility\nduring the trip. He was seen by a Trinidad physician who prescribed an\nethacrynic acid which reduced his lower extremity edema\nsignificantly. However, he subsequently developed diarrhea to this\nmedication and it was stopped. Subsequently his lower extremity has\nonce again worsened and has been treated with increasing doses of\nLasix and with the recent addition of Zaroxolyn. At the present\ntime Dr. Rodriquez states that he has no overt shortness of breath. He\nstill able to sing vigorously and to play woodwinds without any \n\nPage 2\nFreeman Faust, M.D. \nRE: Jacob Rodriquez, M.D. \nJanuary 18, 2120\n\n\nlimitation. He does find ambulating difficult due to the swelling\nin his lower extremities. He has no chest pain, has no cough, no\nsputum production, no hemoptysis. He has no fevers or chills. He\nbelieves his weight is increased by 35 pounds in the past several\nmonths. He believes this is entirely due to edema accumulation. He\ndenies any difficulties with disrupted sleep although he does note\nthat he's becoming increasingly fatigued during the day and is\noften napping in the reclining chair which is new for him. He\ndenies any history of snoring. He has noted no new joint complaints\nalthough he has had a pruritic eruption on the anterior surface of\nhis right lower extremity as well as on his left arm. This has been\npresent for approximately two or three months. Other than that he\nbelieves his bowel and bladder function is normal. Review of\nsystems is otherwise unremarkable. \n\nHis past medical history is significant for:\n     1. Type II diabetes as above. \n     2. An apparent diagnosis of labile hypertension noted in his \n        chart. \n     3. Anemia thought secondary to Hydrochlorothiazide. \n     4. Past history of right bundle branch block. He has no      \n        history of rheumatic fever. \n\nCurrent medications include Atenolol 25mg daily, folic acid,\nGlucophage 850mg bid, Lasix 120mg daily, Lisinopril 15mg daily,\ncompression stockings, Metolazone 2.5mg daily was added recently. \n\nDrug allergies include possible hemolytic anemia due to\nHydrochlorothiazide. \n\nFamily history is significant for diabetes mellitus. \n\nSocial history is assuming for the fact that the patient is an\nimmigrant from trinidad and tobago. He has been living in Haleyville\nsince the early 2059's. He is a Electrician at Wells Fargo. He\nhas minimal exposure to chemicals in his research towards his\nbachelor's degree but none since then. He is a non tobacco user. He\nuses alcohol minimally. He's never had any blood transfusions. He\nlives with his wife. They have no pets. He does not enjoy any\nunusual hobbies not noted above. He has been exposed to\ntuberculosis in the past and has a history of a positive PPD. \n\nOn physical examination today Dr. Rodriquez weighs 193 pounds. Blood\npressure is 136/90. Pulse 83 and regular. Respiratory rate is 20.\nTemperature is 96.8. Resting oxygen saturation is 98-99% with\nambulation in the hallway. This fell to a minimum of 97% with an\nincrease in his heart rate to 100. HEENT exam is significant for a\nclear oropharynx. Sclera are white. Conjunctiva are minimally pale.\nPage 3\nFreeman Faust, M.D. \nRE: Jacob Rodriquez, M.D. \nJanuary 18, 2120\n\n\nThe thyroid gland is normal. Jugular venous distention to\napproximately 10 cm. was noted. Neck was supple. Examination of the\nchest revealed diminished breath sounds bilaterally with dullness\nat both bases. There was no egophony and no wheezes. Otherwise the\nlungs were clear. Cardiac exam with a regular rate in rhythm,\nnormal S1 and S2, an intermittent S4 was appreciated. No RV heave\nor lift was appreciated. No pulmonary artery tap was appreciated.\nThe pontic component of S2 was moderately enhanced. No appreciable\nmurmurs were detected. The point of maximum impulse was in the\nanterior axillary line. Examination of the abdomen revealed a\nnontender abdomen with a palpable liver edge, three fingerbreadths\nbelow the right costal margin. This was nontender and smooth.\nMinimal splenomegaly was also appreciated as well. Normal bowel\nsounds were present. Examination of the extremities reveal three\nplus symmetric edema to the top of the thigh in the lower\nextremities, one plus edema was also present in both upper\nextremities. No clubbing was noted. There were no skin changes\nconsistent with collagen vascular disease. Multiple follicular\nlesions were noted on the anterior aspect of the right thigh as\nwell as on the left arm. Neurological exam was grossly nonfocal. \n\nObjective data include a CBC which most recently demonstrated a\nwhite count of 11.8, hematocrit of 32.1, platelet count of 250.\nDifferential was not remarkable. LVH is elevated at 599, AST is\nmost recently 22. A urinalysis on 12/07/19 was negative for\nprotein. No reportive cast was made. A CEA was notable for a level\nof 2.4 on 1/05/20. An echocardiogram obtained on 12/22/19\ndemonstrated normal LV size with mild concentric LVH and preserved\nLV function. The right ventricle was mildly dilated and\nhypertrophied with mild reduction in RV function. There was trace\nMR with moderate TR. A peak systolic artery pressure of 64 plus\nright atrial pressure was noted. \n\nIn summary Dr. Rodriquez is a 77-year-old gentleman with a clear cut\npulmonary hypertension. The etiology of this is not clear at the\nmoment. Differential diagnosis could include chronic thromboembolic\ndisease, occult underlying pulmonary disease (doubt), obstructive\nsleep apnea, and collagen vascular disease. In addition some\npatients develop a marked pulmonary artery hypertension in the\nsetting of stiff left ventricle even with preserved left\nventricular function although this I think would be a diagnosis of\nexclusion. The degree of his edema is quite striking and I agree\nwith increasing his diuretic regimen. I'm embarking on a course of\nevaluation to exclude the most likely causes. In specific he will\nbe having a CT with IV contrast to rule out chronic thromboembolic\ndisease this afternoon. This has already been arranged by Dr.\nFaust. In addition I'm sending serology including an ANA, an\nantidouble stranded DNA and an anti SCL70. I've also asked Dr. Rodriquez\nPage 4\nFreeman Faust, M.D. \nRE: Jacob Rodriquez, M.D. \nJanuary 18, 2120\n\n\nto undergo polysonography to exclude obstructive sleep apnea. He\nwill be following up with our pulmonary function lab to have formal\npulmonary function testing performed in addition to having an\narterial blood gas drawn. If this evaluation should be unrevealing,\nhe may require more invasive diagnostics. I've already consulted\nformally with Dr. Eddie Roy, the physician with most\nexperience in pulmonary hypertension at this hospital and he would\nbe able to assist us in the further evaluation of Dr. Rodriquez if our\nworkup is nondiagnostic.  \n\nDr. Faust, thank you again for referring Dr. Rodriquez for evaluation.\nI'll plan on seeing him in approximately three to four weeks after\nhis diagnostic tests have been performed. Please do not hesitate to\ncall me with any further questions or concerns. \n\nSincerely, \n\n\n\n\nJose Church, M.D.\n\n/ray\n\nDD: 01/18/20\nDT: 01/19/:0\nDV: 01/18/20\nRecord date: 2120-09-08\n\n                     MARY EMERGENCY DEPT VISIT\n\n \n\nRODRIQUEZ,JACOB   863-35-65-5                       VISIT DATE: 09/08/20\n\nI saw and examined the patient personally.

The wound has not \n\nhealed and then got infected.  He was started on Keflex, then when \n\nthe initial cultures came back showing resistance to Keflex so he \n\nwas switched to Cipro, however, his final cultures showed MRSA.  He \n\ncomes in with increasing redness and pain.  \n\nPAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Hypertension, diabetes, peripheral vascular \n\ndisease, mitral regurgitation, anemia, sleep apnea and pulmonary \n\nhypertension.   \n\nMEDICATIONS:  Documented on the chart.\n\nALLERGIES:  Documented on the chart.  \n\nSOCIAL HISTORY AND FAMILY HISTORY:  He is a Electrician.

GENERAL:  The patient was awake, alert in no distress. \n\nHe does not look toxic.  HEART:  He had a small heart murmur.  \n\nLUNGS:  Clear to auscultation.  ABDOMEN:  Soft and nontender.  \n\nEXTREMITIES:  He had multiple ulcers on his left foot, stage two or \n\nthree, an ulcer on his heel as well as the distal third and fourth \n\ntoes.  There was some mild surrounding cellulitis.  He had 3+ pedal \n\nedema.  The casts were symmetric and nontender.  There is no \n\nadenopathy.  \n\nLABORATORY EVALUATION:  The patient had a white count of about 16, \n\nmildly elevated but no bandemia.  His BUN and creatinine were 50 \n\nand 1.8.  Blood cultures were sent. \n\nTHERAPY RENDERED/COURSE IN ED:  He was given a dose of Vancomycin.  \n\nSurgery was consulted.  The primary came and saw the patient as \n\nwell and he was admitted to the hospital.   \n\nFINAL DIAGNOSIS:  Diabetic foot ulceration with cellulitis, rule \n\nout osteomyelitis.  \n\nDISPOSITION (including condition upon discharge):  Condition is \n\nstable.  \n\n___________________________________                    TT554/9917 \n\nCHRISTOPHER QUIGLEY, M.D.       CQ03                           D:09/09/20 \n\n                                                       T:09/09/20 \n\nDictated by:  CHRISTOPHER QUIGLEY, M.D.       CQ03 \n\n ******** Not reviewed by Attending Physician ********\nRecord date: 2120-12-15\n\nChief Complaint\t\n\nThis is a visit for this patient  with a chief complaint \n\n1.diabetes management, difficulty getting in control.Also to monitor for potential complications of treatment and complications of the disease.\n\n \n\n2. followup of ulcers on feet\n\n\n\n3. edema\n\n\n\n4. hypertension\n\n\n\n5. pulmonary hypertension\n\n\n\nProblems\t    \n\nVenous insufficiency\t      \n\nEdema\t      \n\nMitral regurgitation\t      \n\nAnemia\t      \n\nHypertension\t      \n\nBundle branch block\t      \n\nPulmonary hypertension\t      \n\nDiabetes mellitus\t      \n\nSleep apnea\t      \n\nLower extremity ulcer\t      \n\n\n\nHistory of Present Illness\t\n\nDiabetes= on oral agents- just glyburide one 2.5 mg qd\n\nTrying to keep diet - reviewed\n\nweight:stable\n\nKeeps track of sugars-\n\nDoes not Bring in book to review - but says that sugars are running about 200 past two weeks\n\nNo hypoglycemic episodes\n\nno polyuria,polydipsia,no fevers, no weight loss\n\n\n\n \n\n2. followup of ulcers on feet- ws to have started on antibiotics wednesday, but the prescription was not delivered.

Ishikawa, M.D.\nSurgery\n03 Greenwood Drive\nDyersville, WI  69617\n\n\nDear Hicks,\n\n\nI had the pleasure of seeing Hannah Hendricks in Internal Medicine today.  She was seen alongside my attending, Dr. Heidi Erik-Roy.  As you know, she is a lovely 52-year-old female in whom you have found a left lower extremity bypass surgery.  She comes in today for perioperative risk assessment.  Ms. Hendricks tells me that she has longstanding type 1 diabetes, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and peripheral arterial disease.  She in fact has undergone lower extremity bypass grafting in both her left and right lower extremities.  Specifically, she is status post a right fem-pop bypass in 2066 and a left fem-DP bypass also in 2066.  It appears that her right graft has been functioning well, but her left graft was noted to be occluded many years ago.  She comes in now with a nonhealing ulcer and gangrene in her left toe.  You have planned a redo bypass for this upcoming Saturday.\n\n\nMs. Hendricks tells me that she has never had any history of coronary artery disease.  She has never had any chest discomfort, shortness of breath, orthopnea, PND, lower extremity edema, palpitations, lightheadedness, or syncope.\n\n\nShe does have a strong family history of coronary artery disease with a brother who had several myocardial infarctions and died at the age of 48 of an MI.  She has a report of a prior EKG with suggestion of an old anteroseptal MI.  She has never had any evaluation for underlying coronary artery disease nor has she had any symptoms referable to CAD.\n\n\nIn terms of her functional capacity, she tells me that up until a year ago, she was doing spinning classes without any chest discomfort or shortness of breath whatsoever.  Because of increasing discomfort in her left lower extremity, she had to reduce her exercise and of late has only been able to do weightlifting without aerobic exercise.  She is however able to climb stairs in her home without any discomfort in her chest or any shortness of breath.  She is unfortunately limited significantly by foot pain.\n\n\nHer past medical history is as noted above including type 1 diabetes for which she uses an insulin pump, peripheral arterial disease, status post bilateral lower extremity bypass, hypertension, and hyperlipidemia.\n\n\nHer current medications include aspirin 325 mg, which she started a few days ago, Lipitor 10 mg once daily, Diovan 160 mg twice daily, vitamin C, vitamin B and folic acid supplementation.\n\n\nShe has no clear drug allergies, but does get nauseous and vomiting with Percocet.\n\n\nShe is a past smoker and had smoked for approximately three years, one pack per day in her early 20s.  She works as a Senior Manager of Broadcasting at giant food in Albemarle.\n\n\nAs I mentioned previously, her family history is notable for a brother who died of an MI in his late 40s.\n\n\nOn physical examination, her blood pressure is 135/79, heart rate is 97 and her weight is 137 pounds.  In general, she is very well appearing and in no apparent distress at rest.  She has a jugular venous pressure of approximately 5 cm of water.  She has 2+ carotids with no audible bruits.  Her upper extremities demonstrate 2+ brachial and radial pulses bilaterally.  Her chest is clear to auscultation bilaterally.  Her cardiac exam reveals a regular rate and rhythm, normal S1 and S2, and a soft 2/6 systolic ejection murmur best heard at the left sternal border.  Her abdomen is benign.  She has no abdominal bruits and no significantly palpable aorta.  Her lower extremity exam is notable for a hyperemic left foot with a bandage, which is covering what is reportedly a gangrenous toe.  Her left lower extremity pulses are 1+ in the femoral, absent popliteal and absent distal pulses.  In her right lower extremity, she has 1+ femoral, with no bruit, 2+ popliteal, 2+ DP and 1+ PT.\n\n\nAn EKG done in our clinic today demonstrates a normal sinus rhythm at a rate of 97 beats per minute with a left axis deviation.  There is left atrial enlargement and Q-waves in V1 through V3 suggestive of an old anteroseptal MI.  There are also Q-waves in lead III and aVF, which raises suspicion of an old inferior MI.\n\n\nIn summary, Ms. Hendricks is a lovely 52-year-old female with longstanding diabetes, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and peripheral arterial disease who comes in today for perioperative risk assessment in light of an anticipated redo left lower extremity bypass graft.  She appears to have an excellent functional capacity up until several months ago.  However, I am concerned by her electrocardiogram, which raises the suspicion of underlying coronary artery disease given the findings of a probable inferior and old anteroseptal myocardial infarction.  As such, I think that it would be wise to better delineate her burden of coronary artery disease by way of a stress test prior to her surgery.  Given that her functional status has been so good up until recently, I do not think that we need to delay her surgery.  However, I would start her on a beta-blocker and as such, I have given her a prescription for atenolol 25 mg once daily, which she will start today and continue up to and beyond the perioperative period.\n\n\nDuring the perioperative period, we would recommend that she has tight control of her blood pressure and heart rate with a goal blood pressure less than 120/80 and a goal heart rate less than 60.  I would also make sure to obtain a postoperative EKG to ensure there has not been any changes.\n\n\nWe will try to arrange for an exercise test with arm ergometry and MIBI imaging for tomorrow morning.  If we are unable to do arm exercise, we will obtain an adenosine MIBI.  I will follow up with the results tomorrow after the study is performed.  As I mentioned because her functional capacity is good, I do not anticipate that we will need to make any changes in the surgical scheduling based on the test results.  This is more in order to give us a sense of the underlying burden of coronary artery disease.\n\n\nIt was a pleasure seeing Ms. Hendricks in clinic today.  We are certainly available during the perioperative period if any cardiovascular issues are to arise.  Please feel free to contact me with any questions.\n\n\nSincerely,\n\n\n\n\n______________________________\nFatima K Baird, M.D.\n\n\n\n\n\n\neScription document:0-1465457 IFFocus\n\n\nCC: Trevon Schmidt M.D.\n54 Clinton Street\nDecatur, WI 96857\n\n\n\n\nDD: 05/01/78\nDT: 05/02/78\nDV: 05/01/78\nRecord date: 2078-05-08\n\n\nED Surgery Consult                 Date/Time: 5/8/78   4:56PM\n****************************************************\nName:  Hendricks, Hannah\nMRN# 75322175\nResident: Xavier G.

As you know, she is a 52-year-old woman with a history of peripheral vascular disease.  She underwent a redo left femoral to anterior tibial bypass graft using basilic and cephalic vein from her right arm on May 3, 2078.  She has done well since the procedure.  She is now comes here complaining of left foot pain.  She had an ultrasound in the vascular lab to rule out a DVT, which it did.  She explains the discomfort as pain and burning in the bottom of her foot as well as her arch and over the dorsum of the foot.  \n\n\nOn exam, she is a well appearing female in no acute distress.  She is alert and oriented x3.  She appears grossly neurologically intact.  Her lower extremity exam reveals easily palpable bypass graft pulse in her left leg.  Her left foot is warm and well perfused and she has a very small pinhole ulcer over the plantar aspect of her left great toe.  This does not appear infected and I cannot probe to bone.  It remains superficial.  She has no other ischemic skin changes noted. \n\n\nI have discussed with Hannah that her discomfort most likely is due to peripheral neuropathy due to her diabetes.  She also experienced this discomfort prior to her surgery.  She is enquiring about starting Neurontin.  I have said she would be able to try either Neurontin or Lyrica to help with the peripheral neuropathy.  She will return next week for her postoperative graft scan to assess her circulation.  She knows to contact us sooner if thing worsen. \n\n\nIf I can be of further assistance in her care, do not hesitate to contact me.\n\n\nSincerely,\n\n\nHunter Shea, MD\n\n\nDictated by: Quanisha Logan, PA-C\nRecord date: 2078-09-26\n\n\nDate 09/26/2078                                 Surgery ADMISSION NOTE\n \n\n\nPATIENT: Hendricks, Hannah\n\nMRN: 75322175\n\nAttending: Shea\n\n\n\nCC: L foot pain\n\n\n\nHPI:  52 y/o F with Hx of HTN, hyperlipidemia, PVD, s/p R fem-pop bypass and L fem-DP bypass, both in 2066.  She was doing well until April 2078, when she presented with a non-healing ulcer and gangrene in her L third toe and subsequently underwent a redo L fem-anterior tibial bypass using R basilic and cephalic veins on 5/3/78.  On 6/11/78 she had graft scanning, which indicated a widely patent left leg graft and ankle-brachial indices at that time were normal bilaterally.  However, she presented on 9/17/78 c/o L foot pain.  On physical exam, she was noted to have a very small pinhole ulcer over the plantar aspect of her left great toe.  She now presents with increasing pain, &#8220;32&#8221; on scale 0-10 that is constant in nature, with occasional sharp spikes in intensity.  She also confirms loss of sensation and motor strength in the L foot, but there is no paresthesia.  She denies CP, SOB, N/V, flank pain, or any urinary Sx and has no history of cardiac disease.\n\n\nPMH: \n\n- diabetes type 1 since age 10\n\n- PVD\n\n- HTN\n\n- hyperlipidemia\n\n\n\n\nPSH:\n\n- L fem-anterior tibial bypass - 5/3/78\n\n\n- Right fem-pop bypass - 2066\n\n- Left fem-DP bypass &#8211; 2066 \n\n\n\nMEDS: \n\n- Atenolol 25mg PO QD \n\n- Valsartan 160mg PO BID\n\n- ASA 325mg PO QD \n\n- Oxycodone 5-10mg PO Q3H PRN pain\n\n- Vitamin C 500mg PO BID\n\n- Folic Acid 1mg PO BID\n\n- Colace 100mg PO BID\n\n- Neurontin 300mg PO TID\n\n\n\nALL: Percocet - nausea  \n\nFH: Brother died of heart attack at 48, father had MI x3; no one else in the family has had either DM type I or PVD\n\n\n\nSH:\n\nLives in Morehead, WI with her partner.

She was recently treated\n\nat an outside hospital for bilateral lower extremity cellulitis,\n\nhad a 2-day hospital stay, and was discharged home on Keflex. \n\nShe felt that she did have some improvement but over the past 48\n\nhours has had worsening erythema in lower extremities.  She has\n\nalso been having some emesis, myalgias and fatigue, but has not\n\nhad any hematemesis, abdominal pain, constipation, diarrhea, or\n\nother symptomatology.  She has also not noticed any urinary\n\nsymptoms of frequency.\n\nPAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Peripheral vascular disease, hypertension,\n\nhyperlipidemia, and diabetes.\n\nPAST SURGICAL HISTORY:  Amputation to the left second, third and\n\nfifth toes, bilateral fem-pop bypasses right in 2061, left in\n\n2066 and anterior tibial bypass graft in 05/2078.\n\nSOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient works as a Senior Manager of Broadcasting and denies\n\ntobacco, alcohol, or drugs.\n\nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Blood pressure 146/66, pulse 98,\n\nrespiratory rate 20, temperature 101.2, and O2 saturation 99% on\n\nroom air.  General:  This is a well-appearing woman in no\n\napparent distress.  Respiratory:  Clear to auscultation\n\nbilaterally, no rales, rhonchi, or wheezes.  Cardiovascular: \n\nRegular rate and rhythm, no murmurs, rubs, or gallops.  GI:  The\n\nabdomen is soft.  The patient does have insulin pump in place,\n\nbut has no erythema or fluctuance over the pump.  Skin is warm,\n\ndry, and intact with the exception of the left lower extremity,\n\nwhich is erythematous, warm and slightly swollen compared to the\n\nright lower extremity.  This erythema stops at the ankle and does\n\nnot extend up above the knee.  The patient also has an open\n\nchronic nonhealing wound on the plantar surface of her left foot\n\nas well.  There is no erythema surrounding this wound Neurologic:\n\n Awake, alert, and oriented x3 except for some decreased\n\nsensation in her left foot, which is chronic.\n\nEMERGENCY DEPARTMENT COURSE:  The patient was seen and evaluated\n\nby me and the resident.  I confirm that I have seen and evaluated\n\nthe patient, reviewed the resident's documentation on the\n\npatient's chart, and discussed the evaluation, plan of care, and\n\ndisposition with the patient as well as the resident.\n\nThe patient had a CBC and metabolic panel.  CBC showed white\n\ncount of 14 with shift.  LFTs were within normal limits.  X-ray\n\nof her left foot showed no osteomyelitis seen on x-ray and x-ray\n\nof her tib-fib continued to show no osteomyelitis.  Given the\n\nerythema and swelling, I was concerned about a cellulitis in this\n\nvasculopathic who was also diabetic and so we gave her a 1 g of\n\nvancomycin (especially given the fact that she has failed\n\noutpatient therapy with oral antibiotics) and we are admitting\n\nher to the Medicine Service for cellulitis.  The patient's\n\nerythema and swelling does not extend to her foot and would be\n\nextremely atypical for a DVT.  We also notified the Internal Medicine resident of the patient's admission to Medicine as she is\n\nfollowed closely by Surgery and this notification was\n\nmade at 8:30 p.m.\n\nGiven the fact that she does not have osteomyelitis at this point\n\nwe have not discussed the PICC line and given the fact that she\n\ndoes not have any ____ abnormalities, I did not believe that she\n\nneeds pressors or aggressive hydration and we are starting her on\n\nmaintenance fluids, antibiotics, and admitting her to the\n\nhospital.\n\nDIAGNOSIS:  Left lower extremity cellulitis.\n\nCONDITION:  Stable.\n\nDISPOSITION:  Admit to hospital.\n\n______________________________\n\nFAULKNER, GABRIAL MD\n\nD: 08/05/79\n\nT: 08/05/79\n\nDictated By: FAULKNER, GABRIAL\n\neScription document:7-11192535 BFFocus\n\n ******** Not reviewed by Attending Physician ********"}

Hyperlipidemia.  Fasting lipid analysis one year ago showed total cholesterol 225, triglycerides 265, LDL 161, and HDL 40.  He has not been treated.\n\n3.  Hyperparathyroidism.  PTH level one year ago was 143.  He is on calcium replacement.\n\n4.  IgG monoclonal gammopathy.  This was noted on immunoelectrophoresis.  It was at very low levels.\n\n\n\nMEDICATIONS:  Aspirin 81 mg q.d., Nephrocaps one q.d., and PhosLo 2001 mg t.i.d. by his report.\n\n\n\nREVIEW OF SYMPTOMS:  He states he was told he was hypertensive at last dialysis. No significant weight change, febrile signs or symptoms, headache, blurred vision, tinnitus, chest pain, cough, shortness of breath, nausea, abdominal pain, nightsweats, diarrhea, skin rash, bruising, joint pain, or focal weakness.  \n\n\n\nALLERGIES:  No known allergies.\n\n\n\nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  The patient appears well.  Blood pressure on multiple measurements range from 150-160/78-82, weight 144 pounds, and heart rate 72 and regular.  Chest: Clear to percussion and auscultation.  Cardiovascular exam:  No extra sounds or murmurs.  Abdominal exam:  No masses, tenderness, or organomegaly.  Extremities: No edema.  Skin: No rash.  Musculoskeletal exam: Grossly intact.\n\n\n\nASSESSMENT/PLAN:\n\n1.  Chronic renal failure.  The patient will continue on dialysis.  I have requested screening blood tests.\n\n2.  Hyperlipidemia.  This needs to be treated.  I have asked him to return for reestablishment of baseline.\n\n3.  Hyperparathyroidism.  Secondary to chronic renal failure.  He is on calcium replacement.\n\n4.  Low-grade IgG monoclonal gammopathy. Will recheck values and follow.\n\n5.  Hypertension.  A degrees systolic hypertension warrants therapy.  He is due for dialysis tomorrow, however.  I gave him a prescription for atenolol 25 mg p.o. q.d.\n\n6.  Adult health maintenance.  I gave him a prescription for aspirin, which he should be taking and asked him to return in two weeks for a full annual review.\n\n  I instructed him to show renal staff the prescriptions tomorrow at dialysis.\n\n\n\n\n\n______________________________\n\nXavier T Mccoy, M.D.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\neScription document:4-4113812 EMS\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDD: 03/16/95\n\nDT: 03/16/95\n\nDV: 03/16/95\nRecord date: 2095-09-19\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\nKEKELA INPATIENT DIALYSIS ADMIT NOTE\n\n\n\n\n\nNAME: Marsh, Carl\n\nMRN: 99579205\n\n\n\nPrimary Care MD: Xavier T.

The patient was in his otherwise good state of health when he went to his normal dialysis session yesterday.  The session was uneventful, and he finished dialysis around 7:30 pm.  Around 9 pm, he started noting un-controlable jerky movements of his jaw, arms, and legs.  He was unable to stand by himself, and had difficulty with any motor activity.  It was so bad that he was unable to feed himself, and needed help from his wife to do so.  The jerking continued throughout the night without getting better, and his daughter called his PCP's office today, at which time he was instructed to proceed to the KEKELA ED.  He has had a similar episode like this before in January of 2092, when he developed the exact same jerking movements after a long three day weekend when he went without dialysis (see note in LMR by neurology consultant).  It was deemed at that time that his myoclonus was due to    electrolyte disarray,    and he was admitted to EDUCARE-FARGO and received dialysis the same day with complete resolution of symptoms.  He has been symptom-free since that time.\n\n\n\nHe reports no other new events.

His medical\nhistory includes:\n1.  Hypertension.  He is currently on hydrochlorothiazide 25\nmg q.d. and aspirin q.d.\n2.  Hypercholesterolemia.  The patient is on 30 mg q.h.s. of\nsimvastatin.  His last lipid panel in April of this year\nshowed total cholesterol of 196, triglycerides 169, HDL 52,\nand LDL of 110.  He has no LFTs on file.\n3.  Psychiatry.  According to the patient, he carried a\ndiagnosis of major depression with paranoid features.  He is\nbeing followed by Dr. Uhler, psychiatrist at Marshfield Clinic as well as Betty Villasenor, a therapist at Marshfield Clinic.  He is currently on Depakote, Tegretol, Risperdal,\nand Paxil although he does not know the doses of his\nmedications.  He still feels depressed but his paranoid\nsymptoms have subsided.  He has no manic or hypermanic\nepisodes.\n\nMEDICATIONS:  Aspirin 325 mg q.d., Paxil, Risperdal,\nTegretol, Depakote doses unknown, simvastatin 30 mg q.h.s.,\nHCTZ 20 mg q.d.\n\nALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.\n\nSOCIAL HISTORY:  No tobacco, alcohol, or recreational drugs.\n He quit drinking alcohol 16 years ago.  He has not been\nsexually active for 16 years and is currently not\ninterested.  He lives by himself in  Denver Drive, walks\nabout 20 minutes per day, and is from Louisa originally.\n\nFAMILY HISTORY:  Mother and father died of MIs in their 70s.\n There is no history of sudden cardiac death.  No cancer,\nliver, kidney, or thyroid disease in the family.\n\nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Blood pressure 132/84, heart rate 84,\nand weight 202 pounds.  The remainder of the exam is\ndeferred.\n\nASSESSMENT AND PLAN:\n1.  Hypertension.  The patient is well controlled on his\ncurrent regimen.  I will therefore not change anything\ntoday.\n2.  Hypercholesterolemia.  The patient is at his goal LDL\nlevel.  I will continue to follow his lipid panel yearly.  I\nwill also check LFTs today, given that he had a statin.\n3.  Psychiatry.  The patient will follow up with his\npsychiatrist and therapist.  He will let me know his actual\nmedication and medication doses at his earliest convenience.\n Also, I will recheck an LFT as stated above, given that he\nis on possibly hepatotoxic psychoactive medications.\n4.  Healthcare maintenance.  I have emphasized to the\npatient the benefits of weight reduction as well as\nincreasing his exercise.  He is not interested in any\nexercise as in walking and I have therefore counseled him to\nwalk longer and faster.  He had a negative flexible\nsigmoidoscopy in November 2083 and I will give him stool\ncards today.  His last tetanus was 10 years ago and he is\nnot interested in the booster today.  His immunizations are\notherwise up to date according to him and he will need the\nremainder of the history and a full physical exam at the\nnext visit in 3 months' time.\n\n\n______________________________\nWyatt Yeo, M.D.\n\n\neScription document:0-726841 CFFocus\n\nDD: 08/21/85\nDT: 08/22/85\nDV: 08/21/85\n\n\n\n========================== Preceptor's Note ==========================\n\n\n\n\n\nAugust 21st\n\n\n\nDr Yeo  Mr Wilkerson\n\n\n\n61 year old man  Hx hypertension.Hx elev cholesterol, on zocor.

I have seen and\n\nexamined the patient personally, reviewed the written\n\ndocumentation and agree with the assessment and plan.\n\nHISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Mr. Wilkerson is a 68-year-old\n\ngentleman without significant past medical history, who is\n\nactually being seen here by his primary care physician who\n\nhappens to be a resident rotating ____ normally sees him in MIMAIMA\n\nClinic.  According to Dr. Caldwell, his PCP, he generally does\n\nnot have very much past medical history, but when he gets\n\ninfected, he gets confused.  He presents today with confusion. \n\nHis visiting nurse today noticed that he has been having weakness\n\nand fatigue over the last few days, but today, he was confused as\n\nhe has been when he has been ill in the past.\n\nPAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Dementia, SVT, hypertension, and diabetes\n\ntype 2.\n\nSOCIAL HISTORY:  He is a former smoker.\n\nPAST SURGICAL HISTORY:  Otherwise, negative.\n\nREVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  Otherwise negative except as previously\n\ndictated.\n\nMEDICATIONS:  Lisinopril, hydrochlorothiazide, omeprazole,\n\nRisperdal, Tegretol, verapamil, and Tylenol #3.\n\nALLERGIES:  He has no known drug allergies.\n\nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  He is a healthy, well-appearing Caucasian\n\ngentleman who nevertheless is disoriented to time.  He knows\n\nplace and name.  His heart rate is 101, respiratory rate is 20,\n\nblood pressure is 121/92, and oxygen saturation is 96% on room\n\nair, and his temperature is 101.5.  He had left lower lobe\n\ncrackles in his lung exam.  The remainder of his physical exam\n\nwas otherwise normal.  Mucus membranes were moist.  Abdomen was\n\nsoft.  Extremities had no clubbing, cyanosis, or edema.\n\nLABORATORY DATA:  The patient had a normal chest x-ray, negative\n\nurinalysis.  White blood cell count was 7.12.  He had a\n\ncreatinine of 1.24, up from his baseline and a lactate of 3.8. \n\nHis chest x-ray showed no acute process.\n\nIMPRESSION:  My impression is that the patient has severe sepsis\n\nby virtue of evidence of change in his mental status and his\n\ncreatinine, he was given a liter of normal saline in the\n\nEmergency Department as a bolus.  Given that pneumonia and\n\nurinary tract infection were highest on the list, we decided to\n\ntreat him with Rocephin and azithromycin.  He will be admitted to\n\nthe Medical Service.\n\n______________________________\n\nHODGES, CHAD M.D.\n\nD: 01/17/93\n\nT: 01/17/93\n\nDictated By: HODGES, CHAD\n\neScription document:0-50096032 BFFocus\n\n ******** Not reviewed by Attending Physician ********\nRecord date: 2093-04-11\n\nMEDIQUIK Neurology Consultation \n\nEdward Wilkerson\nMRN: 37199514\nPlease refer to Student Doctor Nicky Li for HPI, ROS and past medical history. \n\n\n\n\nBriefly, 68 yr old male w a h/o HTN, HL, DMII, peripheral neuropathy, schizoaffective disorder, Borderline Personality Disorder s/p SVT ablation on 4/10 who post-operatively has been confused with gait disturbance.

She notes that she is still having occasional sweats at \nnight. She is using the clonidine but she can't take it two times a day, \nit makes her too sleepy, so she takes it about 3:30 towards the end of \nher workday and then again before she goes to bed. She is having some \nright lower back pain and otherwise is feeling well.\n\nREVIEW OF SYSTEMS: Negative except as noted. She is also taking the \nCozaar which she had been taking before. \n\nShe was called back in today as a result of labs which were done \nrecently which showed hemoglobin A1C of 8.7, an elevated urine \nmicroalbuminuria and hypertension which needed follow up.\n\nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION: On exam today, she is well developed and well \nnourished in no acute distress. Blood pressure 158/116, pulse 80, weight \n166. Pupils are equal and equally reactive to light. Lids and \nconjunctiva normal. Retinal fields normal. Disks sharp. Mouth and \npharynx without erythema or exudate. No adenopathy or tenderness in the \nsubmandibular, cervical, posterior cervical, supraclavicular areas. \nHeart sounds: S1, S2, with a II/VI systolic murmur heard best at the \nright sternal border. No rub or gallop. Her chest was clear to \nauscultation anteriorly and posteriorly with no rales, wheezes or \nrhonchi. She was clear to percussion. She has normal bowel sounds. Her \nabdomen was soft and nontender, no mass, organomegaly, and no guarding, \nno rebound. Her extremities are without edema, cyanosis or clubbing. She \nhas no spine or flank tenderness. Her neck is supple, no bruits. Her \nskin is essentially quite dry and itchy. She has multiple dark, \nhyperpigmented, post-inflammatory scarring on her lower extremities. Her \nmouth and pharynx are without erythema or exudate. \n\nIMPRESSION/PLAN:\n1. Hypertension. Her blood pressure is really not well controlled. I \nwill add atenolol to her regimen 50mg PO q.d. She drinks one cup of \ncoffee a day and rarely has alcohol although she notes that she will \noccasionally have one, a scotch, on Friday or Saturday. She does not do \ndrugs. She will return in three week for follow up of her blood \npressure and at that time for a physical exam for which she will be due. \n\n2. Diabetes. The patient had been told in the past that she had diabetes \nbut she was told she did not need any sort of treatment for it. Her \ncreatinine was 0.8 last month and I explained to her that with her \nelevated hemoglobin at 8.7 she needs treatment. We will start her on \nGlucophage 500mg PO b.i.d. I expect we will need to increase this and if \nshe tolerates this she should increase it to 1000mg over the next week. \nI also explained to her that if she does not eat or she is unable to eat \nor if she is NPO she needs to stop taking this medication. I suggested \nshe actually take it with food to insure that she only takes when she is \neating. I gave her a referral to Ophthalmology and to Podiatry. She also \nrequested a glucometer machine and this was ordered for her along with \n\nCAROLYN HUNTINGTON BAILEY HEALTH CENTER\n592 Kristina Street                                Xia, Jean\nNorth East, AL 81699                       CHB9278143\n(687) 396-2722                                12-16-72\nPage 2\n\n\nlancets, alcohol wipes and test strips and again she will return in two \nweeks for follow up.\n\n\n______________________________\nYolanda Osburn, M.D.\n\nCP:FO:3549 ; DD:12-16-72 ; DT:12-16-72 ; DV:12-16-72\nRecord date: 2076-04-23\n\n\n\nCarolyn Huntington Bailey Health Center\n\n592 Kristina Street                                        XIA, JEAN\n\nNorth East, AL 81699                            58269151\n\n(375) 512-0897                                            04/23/76\n\n\nSUBJECTIVE:  The patient comes in today for followup of various problems.

She has been having a lot of headaches.  She has had pain in her right thumb that goes to her right lateral side area.  She has been having hot flashes but no fevers, sweats or chills.  Her sugars have been okay in the 99-120 range, the highest was about 135-140.  She does not really understand why she is feeling so bad with these headaches and other problems.\n\n\n\nREVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  Conducted in detail and was otherwise negative.\n\n\n\nMEDICATIONS:  She has not taken any medications for the last two days.  She does have her diabetes medications but no blood pressure medication.  She usually takes Cozaar 100 daily, Glucophage 1000 b.i.d., Glucotrol XL 5 daily, Lipitor 20 daily, Norvasc 10 daily.  She has not been needing Nexium of late.\n\n\n\nALLERGIES:  Clonidine caused sleepiness and codeine rash.\n\n\n\nSOCIAL HISTORY:  She does not smoke or use street drugs.  She does have a little bit of white wine when she has guests on occasion.\n\n\n\nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  On exam, well developed, well nourished, no acute distress.  Blood pressure 152/120, pulse 76, temperature 97.2, weight 166.  Pleasant, articulate in English, she appears comfortable.  Pupils equal, equally reactive to light.  Retinal fields have sharp disks.  Mouth and pharynx without erythema or exudate, no adenopathy or tenderness in the submandibular, cervical, posterior cervical, supraclavicular areas.  Thyroid nontender, non-nodular.  Neck supple, no spine or flank tenderness.  No bruits, no stridor.  Heart sounds S1, S2, regular rate and rhythm, no murmur, rub or gallop.  Chest is clear to auscultation anteriorly and posteriorly with no rales, wheezes or rhonchi.  She is clear to percussion.  Normal bowel sounds.  Abdomen soft, nontender, no mass, organomegaly, no guarding, no rebound.  Extremities are without edema, cyanosis or clubbing, no calf tenderness.  Sensation is intact to microfilament testing bilaterally on her feet.  Pedal pulses are present.  Feet are warm.  There is no rash, maceration, or lesion on her feet.\n\n\n\nLABORATORY DATA:  Hemoglobin A1c from October was 7.2.  LDL from last May was 164.\n\n\n\nIMPRESSION AND PLAN:\n\n1.  Diabetes.  Her diabetes has been near goal.  We will recheck glucose, hemoglobin A1c, UA, and microalbuminuria and see how she is doing today.\n\n2.  Elevated cholesterol.  Her cholesterol was nowhere near our target of 100.  She is on an increased Lipitor.  We will check cholesterol, see how she is doing at this point, and an OT, PT to make sure she is tolerating the medication.\n\n3.  Hypertension.  All of her symptoms today are most likely due to her hypertension.  I explained at great length that the reason for all of her symptoms is the fact she stopped taking her medication.  She seemed surprised that it would have such an immediate and strong effect and I explained to her that it does.  She has to take her medication every day.  I told her she had to leave the Carolyn Huntington right now, go immediately to the drugstore to pick up the medication and she said she would do that.

She states that her pain started about three weeks ago when she was bending and picking up a pot. She states she had a pain in her back that radiated around her right side down her groin into her medial leg, not past the knee. She states that it went away at that time. The next day she felt worsened and had difficulty working and saw her physician.  An MRI was ordered. Since then, she feels about 60-75 percent better. She states that her pain is constant and describes it as a sharp pain. She does state she feels weak and her knee would buckle. She does not have any numbness or tingling. She states she uses a walker to get to her bathroom, however, otherwise stays in the recliner. Her symptoms are increased with lying down and standing and decreased with sitting.  \n\n \n\nTherapeutically, she has not received any physical therapy or occupational therapy. She is currently taking Darvocet, however, less frequently, and Celebrex for arthritis. Diagnostically, she has had an MRI scan in April 2092 that showed multi-level spinal stenosis, most prominent at L3/L4, especially on the right side, secondary to facet arthropathy and ligamentum flavum infolding, as well as possibly a mild disk bulge. Her mammogram was done in 2091 which was okay. She has not had a bone mineral density at this time.  \n\n \n\nMEDICATIONS: Currently, the medication she is on is Celebrex, Hyzaar for her blood pressure, and Darvocet for her pain.   \n\nALLERGIES: She states that taking Tylenol With Codeine gives her toes a burning sensation, and ibuprofen causes tinnitus.   \n\nPAST MEDICAL HISTORY: She has got high blood pressure and shoulder arthritis.  \n\n \n\nPAST SURGICAL HISTORY: She had a left breast biopsy which she states was not cancerous.  \n\n \n\nSOCIAL/FUNCTIONAL HISTORY: She is functionally currently not working. She is taking sick time. She has not worked for the past three weeks. She is a Head Nurse and worked at The Library Corporation for the last 35 years. She states her job is medium as far as intensity of work. Functionally, her activities of daily living are limited, and she uses an assistive device.  \n\n \n\nSOCIAL HISTORY: She is widowed and she has four healthy children, ages 51, 50, 48, and 46. She does not smoke or drink.   \n\nFAMILY HISTORY: She has aunts with diabetes and brother that had an myocardial infarction at 59.  \n\n \n\nREVIEW OF SYSTEMS: On review of systems, no fevers, chills, recent infections, bladder, thyroid problems, rash, shortness of breath, palpations, chest pain, nausea, abdominal pain, diarrhea, or bowel or bladder or sexual problems or urination difficulty.  She does have some joint pain and swelling in her shoulders and her feet occasionally. She does not have any numbness or tingling. She does have some trouble walking secondary to the pain. She does not feel fatigued and her appetite is okay and she does not feel anxious or stressed. She does have some mild trouble with sleeping, however, this has improved over the last few days.  \n\n \n\nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION: On physical examination, well-developed, well-nourished, well-groomed, normal mood and affect, but slightly anxious with movement, female in no acute distress at this time. On musculoskeletal examination of lumbar spine, flexion was within normal limits. Extension she had her type of pain at about 10-20 degrees. Side-bending was unremarkable. On hip examination she had some decreased internal rotation on the right when compared to the left. Straight leg raise bilaterally was negative, however, supine, slight guarding on the right.  Femoral stretch was positive on the right but not on the left. On neurological examination, as far as motor examination, there is some slight decrease, half a grade, quadriceps and hip flexors; however, this was functional; otherwise unremarkable on the right or the left. Her reflexes were 2 plus in the achilles. Babinskis were downgoing, 1 plus at the patella on the right, and 2 plus on the left. Sensory examination slightly decreased at L3 on the right; however, normal throughout; otherwise, gait was antalgic on the right and she did not want to bear weight.  \n\n \n\nIMPRESSION:  \n\n1. Right L3 acute radiculopathy secondary to herniated disk and facet arthropathy.  \n\n2. Functional limitations secondary to pain, causing her functional weakness.  \n\n \n\nRECOMMENDATIONS:  \n\n1. Transforaminal epidural steroid injection at L3 and L4 on the right.  \n\n2. Physical therapy after her injection.  \n\n3. Continue her medications of Darvocet and Celebrex.  4. Keep her out of work until she is able to receive the injection, as well as continue with her physical therapy to improve her strength, given her acute radiculopathy.   \n\nThe patient was seen and examined with Dr. Xayasane, who agrees with the plan above.  \n\n \n\n \n\n_______________________________ \n\nEdward Xayasane, M.D.  \n\ncc: David Utterback, M.D.  \n\nDD:05/06/2092 \n\nDT:05/09/2092 \n\nTL:95468     :423\nRecord date: 2097-06-03\n\n Time of visit: 6/03/2097, 1330 hours\nTime of note: 1630 hours\n\nPatient seen and examined with the team.  Note of Dr. Ellis reviewed, findings confirmed.  Available electronic notes reviewed, X-rays reviewed, labs reviewed.  \n\n73 y. o. woman who has worked as a nurse at TLC for 40 years.  Nonsmoker.  History of hypertension treated with Hyzaar.  Current illness began 5-6 months ago with fatigue, dyspnea on exertion that has progressed to the point that she has to stop to catch her breath after walking up only 4-5 steps in a stairwell.  She finds it difficult to get started on her work because of fatigue.  She has had a cough that initially produced yellowish, \"slimy\" sputum, but more recently has been dry.  She notes occasional wheezing.  She also noted muscle and joint pain involving the shoulders and lower extremities over the past 5-6 months that she attributed to \"arthritis\".  No polyuria, but has noted nocturia X2 for the past 5-6 months. During the same period of time, has noted very dry mouth. No abdominal pain, but some difficulty with constipation for the past two weeks.\n\nAppetite diminished and she lost about 30 pounds.  She noted a nodule on the extensor surface of the left elbow that her PCP \"cut into\" recently.  She has also noted a nodule on the dorsal surface of the right foot that seems to \"get larger\".  \n\nShe experienced substernal chest pain with radiation to the back that lasted several hours, prompting her to come to the ER.  No associated diaphoresis, nausea.  Pain somewhat better with sitting up.  \n\nOf note, she has known of having a cardiac murmur for many years.  \n\nExam:  Pleasant black woman in no distress.  BP 158/79, Pulse 80, regular; O2 sat 98% on room air.  Afebrile.  Skin darkly pigmented nodule left elbow extensor surface, similar nodule right dorsal foot just proximal to 4th/5th toe.  No other rashes.  HEENT:  pale conjunctivae, anicteric.  No nasal findings, no facial skin findings (specifically, no lupus pernio).  Dry mucous membranes.  Neck: small, soft, mobile 0.5 cm node left anterior cervical chain.  Chest:  inspiratory crackles at both bases.  Cardiac: No JVD.  Regular rhythm.  III/VI (I do not feel a thrill) harsh nearly holosystolic murmur heard throughout the precordium, but especially prominent at the RUSB with radiation to the clavicles, neck.  Also heard at the apex and radiates to the left mid-back (?same murmur).  The murmur intensifies when she stands.  No gallops.  No rub.  Abdomen soft and nontender.  No spleen tip.  Liver edge not palpable.  \nLymph nodes:  fullness below the left axilla, although not confident of discrete nodes.  \n\nData:  There is considerable testing available to us from her recent visits to the Walk-In Clinic and to Dr. Utter.  \n\nA CXR from 5/2097 shows bilateral hilar adenopathy, mediastinal adenopathy, and interstitial infiltrates.  \n\nCreatinine 1.7\n\nDate/Time         CA             ALB            \n06/03/2097        12.3 (H)       3.4            \n06/02/2097        12.8 (H)       3.5            \n05/28/2097        11.8 (H)       3.5            \n\nDate/Time         ALT/SGPT       AST/SGOT       ALKP           TBILI          \n06/03/2097        41 (H)         41 (H)         67             0.7            \n\nDate/Time         NT-BNP         CK             CK-MB          CKMBRI         \n06/03/2097                       135            9.6 (H)                       \n06/03/2097                       126            8.6 (H)        6.8 (H)        \nE                      \n06/02/2097        4285 (H)[1]                                                 \n06/02/2097                                      NEGATIVE                      \n\nDate/Time         TROP-I         TROP-T         \n06/03/2097                       0.12 (H)       \n06/03/2097                       0.12 (H)       \n06/02/2097        NEGATIVE                      \n06/02/2097        NEGATIVE                      \n\nDate/Time         FE             TIBC           FER                         \n05/28/2097        33             237            130                           \nDate/Time         WBC            RBC            HGB            HCT            \n06/03/2097        6.4            3.98 (L)       10.2 (L)       30.4 (L)       \n\nDate/Time         MCV            MCH            MCHC           PLT            \n06/03/2097        76 (L)         25.5 (L)       33.5           198                  \n\nDate/Time         DIFFR          METHOD         %NEUT          %LYMPH         \n06/03/2097        RECEIVED       Auto           71 (H)         20 (L)         \n\nDate/Time         %MONO          %EOS           %BASO          \n06/03/2097        6              3              0              \n\nDate/Time         RETIC          \n06/03/2097        1.7            \n\n\nSerum angiotensin converting enzyme 68 (7-46 U/L)\nLDH 354\n\nEKG:  ST elevations V1-3.\n\nProblems:\n\n1.

Changes with maneuvers suggest this may be secondary to hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy.  There was evidence to suggest this on an echo from 2085, but obviously, need more recent data.\n7.  Minimally elevated troponins.  Uncertain significance.\n8.  Anemia, mildly microcytic.\n9.  Elevated LDH.\n10.  Renal insufficiency, likely secondary to uncontrolled hypercalcemia.\n11.  History of hypertension.\n\nDiscussion:\n\nSarcoidosis, until proven otherwise.  She is obviously older than typical presentation of sarcoidosis, but she had previous lymphadenopathy that may have been a first presentation of the illness with spontaneous remission.  The lung findings, systemic symptoms, hypercalcemia, anemia, abnormal serum ACE level are all suggestive of this diagnosis.  \n\nHer hypercalcemia is symptomatic and should be treated with volume repletion.  She should not receive diuretics at present.  Long term treatment will be dependent on the underlying diagnosis and its treatment.  I think she will need corticosteroids for her sarcoidosis and I expect this will improve the hypercalcemia, but we need definitive diagnosis first.  \n\nThe cardiac murmur is impressive, but likely unrelated to the pulmonary disease.  We need echocardiogram to better define valvular function.  The minimally elevated troponins are not felt to be of clinical significance at this point.  Appreciate Cardiology input on this finding.  \n\nSuggest:\n\n1.  Stop HCTZ,avoid diuretics until fully volume repleted.\n2.  IV normal saline.  May need rates in the 150-200 range to control her hypercalcemia acutely, but she has had this for some time, so can be conservative with fluids approach.\n3.  Agree with check PTH, vitamin D levels.\n4.  Follow lytes, creatinine, calcium, Hct.\n5.  Agree with check echocardiogram.\n6.  We should ask the Pulmonary Service to see her in consultation.  Bronchoscopy with biopsy may be the best way to obtain confirmatory tissue for diagnosis of sarcoidosis.\n\n\n\n\n\n_____________________________________________\nEdmond I.

At that time, the patient noted that 3-4 mo PTA she had experienced worsening fatigue and dry mouth, as well as poor oral intake with associated 30 lb weight loss. \n\nIn early May, she presented to the walk-in clinic with these complaints and a CXR showed increased interstitial markings and mediastinal lymphadenopathy subsequently confirmed by CT. A PET CT showed FDG avidity in multiple enlarged thoracic and axillary nodes. The patient was seen at the lymphoma center by Dr. Utter, and concern was raised for multiple processes including sarcoid, lupus-like syndromes, Castleman's, and indolent lymphoma. Labs drawn at different times in recent past were notable for a Ca of 11.8 with Alb of 3.5, a mild tranaminitis in the 40s, LDH of 354, ACE of 68, normal TSH, HCT of 30.2, ESR of 85, SPEP with diffuse gamma globulin increase, positive ANA at 1:2560 with nuclear pore staining (highly specific for biliary cirrhosis), elevated B2MG at 17.5, and elevated kappa and lambda free light chains at 66 and 83.5, respectively and negative HIV. The patient   s hypercalcemia was treated with IVF, lasix at times, and a dose of bisphosphonate, which led to a decrease in Ca to 10.1.\n\nAxillary lymph node biopsy 6/08/97 revealed non-specific follicular hyperplasia, though to be consistent with a reactive process. Oncology was consulted, and a lymphoma work-up was pursued; flow cytometry revealed polyclonal CD19+ B cells, CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, with no evidence for a monoclonal B or unusual T cell population. Repeat CT examination of the chest revealed no change in the bilateral axillary, mediastinal, and hilar lymphadenopathy and offered no further clues to diagnostic possibilities.  The patient underwent pulmonary function testing, which showed a reduction in the FEV1, FVC, and FEV1/FVC ratio; total lung capacity and subdivisions were normal, resistance and specific conductance were normal, and single breath diffusion capacity was reduced. On 7/19/97, a bronchoscopy was attempted, but the patient was unable to tolerate the procedure, and it was not performed. Thoracic surgery was consulted and recommended that the patient be evaluated in the outpatient setting for biopsy under general anesthesia. Fungal antibodies were sent, and a trial of steroids was not attempted during hospitalization. \n \nSince discharge, the pt reports that she continues to feel very fatigued, and has not    felt like eating.    She reports significant acid reflux, saying    only water goes down    and a lack of appetite with very dry mouth. She notes continued weight loss of 15lbs since leaving the hospital, tolerating little more than 1-2 cans of Ensure/day per her family. She further denies N/V, diarrhea, fever/chills/dizziness or recent infection. Of note, she has been drinking little, but urinating 9-10 times a day, clear urine with large volumes. She has not had a bowel movement for several days. She has continued her medications as instructed at the time of discharge.\n\nIn addition, her family notes a dramatic change in her mood and activity level since prior to hospitalization. She used to be very active, working nearly every day and keeping up her household.

She had an IVC filter placed and was started on anticoagulation and discharged again to Harton Center on 12/1 and now presents with nausea, vomiting, and several days of poor PO intake.  This is actually her fifth admission to MEDIQUIK this year &#8211; first in June when she was diagnosed with HOCM and then in July when she was started on empiric steroids for sarcoidosis.  She says her appetite has never returned to normal since her surgery (although her July admission note also documented malaise and poor appetite) and that she has had some mild nausea on a daily basis since her surgery.  The nausea and her fatigue became worse four or five days prior to admission and since then she has been vomiting many times a day.  The nausea is not related to meals and she has not noted any blood in the emesis.  She has had poor intake as a result of the nausea and has only had broth over the last few days.  She denies fevers, chills, headaches, cough, abdominal pain, or change in the character of her colostomy output.  \n\n\nED COURSE:  \nOn arrival to the ED, vitals were as follows: 98, 164/84, 84, 24, 98%/RA.  Her abdomen was non-tender and minimally distended.  CT of the abdomen was concerning for a distal small bowel obstruction although no focal transition point was identified.  She was seen by surgery and an NGT was placed.  She was given 2L of IVF and morphine 2mg IV x2.   \n\n\nROS\nAs above, otherwise reports baseline blurry vision (has been told of cataracts in the past). Denies SOB, cough, CP, chest pressure, orthopnea, palpitations.\nFoley catheter in place but denies suprapubic tenderness.  \n\n\nMEDICAL HISTORY\n-          PE: saddle embolus 11/17, s/p IVC filter, on coumadin\n-          lupus anticoagulant positive\n-          HTN\n-          HOCM: diagnosed 6/97\n-          Sarcoidosis: empirically started on prednisone 7/97 in the setting of hypercalcemia\n-          PBC: +AMA, not confirmed on biopsy\n-          Urge incontinence, rectocele, bladder prolapse \n-          H/o PAF \n-          DM\n\n\nSURGICAL HISTORY\n-                 10/18/97: Perforated diverticulitis, s/p ex lap, hartmanns procedure, small bowel resection and mobilization of left colon \n-                 Multiple LN biopsies\n\n\n\n\nFAMILY HISTORY \nThree children with DM.\n\n\nSOCIAL HISTORY\nOriginally from .

Lactate was within normal limits so small bowel ischemia unlikely.  Also abdominal exam remains benign at this time.  \n\nAppreciate surgery input\nNGT to low wall suction\nNPO except meds for bowel rest\nSerial abdominal exams\nCheck colostomy output guaiac\nAcute renal failure: Her creatinine was up from a baseline of 1.0 to 2.1 on admission.  With IVF hydration in the ED it has already started to come down to 1.8 so it was likely pre-renal in the setting of poor intake and vomiting.  \n\nContinue IVF while NPO\nWill trend Cr and pursue further ARF work-up if not down on AM labs\nAnemia: Baseline hematocrit in low 30s, last 32.6 prior to discharge on 11/30.  She does not appear to have an active source of bleeding and her bilirubin is within normal limits so she is unlikely to be hemolyzing.  She likely either has iron-deficiency anemia (although she has been taking iron supplements) or anemia of chronic disease &#8211; or a combination thereof.  Her RDW is only mildly elevated which likely indicates inappropriately low hematopoiesis.  \n\nTransfuse 1U PRBCs\nCheck colostomy guaiac\nCheck iron studies, reticulocyte count\nElevated INR/hypercoagulability: She is baseline hypercoagulable with lupus anticoagulant and has had the recent large DVT/PE s/p IVC filter placement.  She comes in with an elevated INR and is likely supratherapeutic on her coumadin.  She does not need to be reversed as she does not seem to be actively bleeding.\n\nHold Coumadin for now\nFollow up INR, goal 2-3\nHOCM/HTN: \n\nContinue lopressor, verapamil\nSarcoid:\n\nContinue Prednisone at 5mg daily\nPAF\n\nContinue Amiodarone &#8211; follow-up with PCP regarding indication for Amio\n\n\nF/E/N:  NPO\nPPX: coumadin, PPI, bowel regimen\n\n\nCODE:  Full\n\n\n\n__________________________________\nAntoinette S Delaney, MD, Pager #63784\nRecord date: 2098-08-03\n\n\n\nInternal Medicine G Intern Admission Note\n\nPATIENT:  Wilhelm, Goldy\n\nMRN: 9543443\n\nADMIT DATE: 8/2/98\n\nPCP:  Dr. Casey Frey\n\n\n\nHPI: 74F with sarcoidosis, HTN, CHF, HOCM, PE s/p IVC filter now on coumadin, PVD s/p L BKA, and DM who presents from her rehab facility with failure to thrive and increasing lethargy for several weeks. Of note, pt had recent admission to MEDIQUIK (6/29-7/05) at which time she presented with similar complaints of fatigue/lethargy and routine CBC demonstrated an elevated WBC (15) and low Hct (23). She was ultimately found to have an Enterococcus bacteremia and intra-abdominal abscess that grew out E. coli. She underwent IR drainage of the abdominal collection and completed a course of Vanc/CTX. Outpatient f/u abd CT (7/18) showed near complete resolution of the intra-abdominal collection. Since that time, however, pt&#8217;s sons report increasing lethargy at her nursing facility. Patient has no complaints. Specifically, she denies fatigue, chest pain, shortness of breath, dizziness, motor weakness and fevers and chills. However, given concern on the part of her sons, pt was taken to the MEDIQUIK ED. \n\n\n\nIn the MEDIQUIK ED, she was afebrile with HR 70, BP 150/74, RR 24, and Sa02 100% RA. \n\n\n\nPMH: \n\nHypertension\n\nHistory of Congestive heart failure, HOCM(EF =77%)\n\nPulmonary embolism (11/97) s/p IVC filter now on coumadin\n\nPeripheral vascular disease \n\ns/p left BKA 4/29/98 due to ischemic gangrene of left foot.\n\nDiabetes mellitus (HbA1C = 6.3mg/dL  - 1/98)\n\nSarcoidosis\n\nBreast mass w/ axillary lymphadenopathy\n\nPerforated small bowel diverticulitis s/p sigmoid resection w/Hartmann procedure with diverting colostomy by Dr. Joshi in 10/97 (removed  9\" of jejunum)\n\nHeterozygous hemoglobin S - on 6/20/2085 Hb electropheresis\n\n\n\nMeds: \n\n  1.

Gallbladder wall calcifications.\n\n\n\nA/P: 74F with sarcoidosis, HTN, CHF, HOCM, PE s/p IVC filter now on coumadin, PVD s/p L BKA, and DM who presents from her rehab facility with failure to thrive and increasing lethargy for several weeks. \n\n\n\n1. Failure to thrive / lethargy: The etiology of this pt&#8217;s lethargy is unclear. It is notable, however, that her presentation on this admission is very similar to her presentation in July at which time she was found to be bacteremic with an additional intra-abdominal bacterial collection. At present, there is no clear source of infection, although her urinalysis is suspicious for a UTI. Elevated WBC in someone on chronic steroids is concerning for infection, but pt is hemodynamically stable and afebrile. In addition to bacteremia, UTI and re-accumulation of an intra-abdominal collection, other possible causes of her lethargy include toxic/metabolic causes (such as uremia), anemia, or depression. \n\n                - F/u blood,  urine, and respiratory cultures\n\n                - Will hold off on empirically starting abx based on urinalysis (If we were to start abx, would \n\n                 recommend vanc/cefepime given micro history)\n\n- Culture if spikes\n\n                - Consider repeat abd imaging if pt continues to have a leukocytosis and doesn&#8217;t clinically \n\n                 improve\n\n\n\n2. Anemia &#8211; Source of anemia has been unclear in the past. During last admission, pt was found to be guaiac positive on rectal exam but guaiac negative out of colostomy. GI at that time had deferred colonoscopy. It is possible that her anemia may be responsible for her failure to thrive. \n\n                - Type and screen\n\n                - Will transfuse 1 unit of pRBCs and monitor for clinical improvement\n\n                - Check post-transfusion Hct \n\n\n\n3. HTN &#8211; pt has long-standing refractory hypertension despite numerous anti-hypertensive agents\n\n                - Per pharmacy recommendations, holding propranolol given h/o SOB\n\n                - Continue clonidine, verapimil and hydral (titrate as needed)\n\n4. Elevated INR &#8211; pt has a supratherapeutic INR. Given that pt is near discharge Hct from previous admission, do not feel that she is actively bleeding. As such, do not feel the need to actively reverse her. \n\n                - Monitor daily INRs\n\n                - Hold warfarin overnight\n\n\n\n5.

The patient was counseled regarding smoking\n\ncessation.\n\nMEDICATIONS:  Hydrochlorothiazide and Coumadin.\n\nALLERGIES:  None.\n\nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  The patient is awake and alert in no acute\n\ndistress.  Vital signs are within normal limits as documented. \n\nFor full physical exam findings, please see the resident's\n\nwritten note.  Specifically, HEENT, neck, respiratory, cardiac,\n\nrectal, and abdominal exam are within normal limits as\n\ndocumented.  Skin exam is remarkable for erythematous changes in\n\nthe groin where the patient has significant skin fold due to\n\nobesity.  Musculoskeletal exam is otherwise unremarkable.  Range\n\nof motion is full.  Strength and tone is normal.  The patient\n\ndoes have a positive straight leg raise on the left, reproducing\n\nher back pain.  Neurologically, the patient has a flat affect but\n\nis oriented with intact cranial nerves and no focal neurologic\n\ndeficit in either motor or sensory distribution.  She does,\n\nhowever, walk with a limp, which is chronic for her.\n\nLABORATORY DATA:  White blood count is slightly elevated at 11.3.\n\n BUN and creatinine is also significantly elevated at 26 and 1.1,\n\nrespectively.  Potassium is also quite low at 2.9.  Urinalysis is\n\npositive with 35-40 white blood cells, 15-20 red blood cells, and\n\n2+ bacteria.\n\nEMERGENCY DEPARTMENT COURSE:  My chief concern for this patient\n\nis her inability to care for self at home.  It is apparent that\n\nher son is interested in helping her and do so, but the patient\n\non physical exam has some obvious lack of hygiene and I am\n\nconcerned that potentially the patient has either an underlying\n\nneurologic or psychiatric issue that is preventing her from\n\nthriving at home.  Psychiatry initially was consulted.  Their\n\nimpression was that the patient may have neuro behavior problem\n\nthat needs further outpatient workup, and she was referred to a\n\nspecific providers within the next 2 weeks.  The patient was\n\ntreated with potassium chloride for her hypokalemia.  Care\n\ncoordinator and social services were consulted.  The patient will\n\nhave a home safety evaluation and will be referred for primary\n\ncare services, was discharged with a cane for ambulation, and\n\nwill likely also receive VNA Services to help her with medication\n\ncompliance and other ADLs.\n\n ******** Not reviewed by Attending Physician ********\n\nDIAGNOSES:\n\n1.  Chronic low back pain.\n\n2.  Hypokalemia.\n\n3.  Urinary tract infection.\n\n4.  Failure to thrive.\n\nDISPOSITION:  Discharged.\n\nCONDITION ON DISCHARGE:  Satisfactory.\n\n______________________________\n\nIP, CARRIE MD\n\nD: 01/13/93\n\nT: 01/13/93\n\nDictated By: IP, CARRIE\n\neScription document:1-1843613 BFFocus\nRecord date: 2093-02-28\n\n\n\nPersonal Data and Overall Health\n\nMrs. Barr is a 57  years old lady with multiple significant medical problems new to KEKELA.\n\n\n\nChief Complaint\n\nShe is here today for a Physical  Exam\n\n\n\nHistory of Present Illness\n\nPatient has HO HTN for years and CVA.

After speaking for her for 20 minutes she tells me that at age 28 she had a miscarriage of her twins. She was jumping rope and after coming back home her husband told her if she was trying to kill the twins. That night she had a miscarriage and one baby was born in the toilet and the otherone was taken by the EMTs. She was 4 months pregnant. She had therapy then and meds and felt a little better. Her husband died 6 years ago and before he died he reminded her that she had killed his twins. She felt bad and has felt bad since.

At the time, he sustained an injury to his \n\nright knee which healed and then began to break down, and he \n\ndeveloped a large wound which began draining and had foul odor.  \n\nThe patient had continued difficulty ambulating and presented to \n\nthe emergency department for evaluation.  The patient denies having \n\nany hardware in his knee.  No history of osteomyelitis.  No \n\nhardware.  No history of peripheral neuropathy.  \n\nREVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  Patient denies any fevers or chills.  No nausea \n\nor vomiting.  No abdominal pain.  No chest pain or shortness of \n\nbreath.  Patient is only complaining of difficulty ambulating \n\nsecondary to the pain.   \n\nPAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Two patellar tendon repairs at EDUCARE-PULLMAN in 2083, \n\nrepair of a patellar fracture.  Recent diagnosis of diabetes, \n\natrial fibrillation.  Hypertension, high cholesterol, and positive \n\nPPD.  \n\nMEDICATIONS:  Please see nurses note for list of medications. \n\nALLERGIES:  PENICILLIN (rash). \n\nSOCIAL HISTORY AND FAMILY HISTORY:  The patient is a smoker.  He \n\ndoes not drink alcohol.  He works in engineering, and lives alone. \n\nFamily history is noncontributory. \n\nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  GENERAL:  Patient is awake, alert, talking \n\nin full sentences, in mild distress secondary to pain.  VITAL \n\nSIGNS:  Afebrile, temperature 99.3, respiratory rate 20, blood \n\npressure 161/96, pulse 95.  HEAD:  Atraumatic.  NECK:  Supple.  \n\nLUNGS:  Clear to auscultation.  No wheezes, rales or rhonchi.  \n\nHEART:  Regular rate.  No murmurs, gallops or rubs.  ABDOMEN:  \n\nSoft, nontender.  SKIN:  A large ulcer to the right knee, right \n\nover the patella, with significant amount of break-down necrotic \n\ntissue and purulent discharge with a foul odor.  The depth of the \n\nwound is difficult to assess.  Intact motor function and sensation. \n\nFull flexion and extension of the knee, and evidence of well-healed \n\nmidline scar above the ulcer.  NEURO:  Intact with good pulses \n\npalpable throughout.  \n\nLABORATORY EVALUATION:  Plain film of the right knee, CT of the \n\nright knee, and laboratory values done.  Laboratory values \n\ndemonstrated a white count of 14, ESR of 13, ESRP of 2.1.  Rest of \n\nthe labs were normal except for an elevated glucose to 226.  Film \n\nof the knee shows patellofemoral arthritis with no evidence of \n\nosteomyelitis, no hardware seen.  CT of the knee showed a \n\nsuperficial ulcer to the depth of the patellar tendon but the \n\npatellar tendon itself was intact.  \n\nTHERAPY RENDERED/COURSE IN ED:  The patient was initially seen by \n\northopedic who felt that the ulcer was over the patellar tendon, at \n\nthe site of prior surgeries, with no effusion or joint pain, and \n\nnormal range of motion with joint involvement unlikely.  We are all \n\nvery hesitant to tap this knee and it will not be done at this time \n\nfor fear of introducing infection into the joint.  The patient is \n\nawaiting consultation by general surgery for probable admission and \n\ndebridement in the operating room.  The plan at this time was to \n\nhold off on antibiotics.  Blood cultures were sent.  The patient is \n\nreceiving IV fluids. \n\nCONSULTATIONS (including PCP):  Orthopedics, general surgery.\n\nFINAL DIAGNOSIS:  Knee ulcer.\n\nDISPOSITION (including condition upon discharge):  The patient was \n\nadmitted and transitioned to ED Obs, awaiting evaluation by the \n\nsurgical service for probable admission.  The patient is currently \n\nin stable and satisfactory condition, in Obs awaiting surgery \n\nevaluation.\n\n___________________________________                    VN983/2356\n\nSHERRY PERKINS, M.D.  SP79                          D:04/03/95 \n\n                                                       T:04/04/95 \n\nDictated by:  SHERRY PERKINS, M.D.  SP79 \n\n ******** Not reviewed by Attending Physician ********\nRecord date: 2096-02-13\n\nSaint John Valley Health Center\n\n707 Newburgh Street\n\nSulphur, AR. 26822\n\n859-168-0145\n\n\n\nCC: f/up of RLE ulcerations\n\n\n\nHPI: 55 yo male with f/up for RLE ulcerations reporting\n\na temp this past Wednesday AM to 101.2.

However, BP was reportedly as high as 190/106 (and wife says she&#8217;s measured it this high at home at least once in past 2 weeks), and blood glucose 400s. I see no LMR note about the visit, but am told that he was given some medication for his BP, given some insulin and a Rx for insulin, and instructed to see his PCP the next day, and discharged. Friday he did see his PCP, who told him not to take insulin but to take oral DM meds instead, and told him to return to the ED b/c he still had a terrible HA, so he came back to the EDUCARE-PULLMAN ED tonight. He was given caffeine, ibuprofen, Tylenol, and compazine, reported that his HA was gone. However, a staff physician in the ED on exam noted a wide based gait.

Neurology was specifically consulted for his gait, which does appear a bit wide-based, but he and wife confirm that this is chronic, and I strongly doubt any relation to his current HA problems. Most obvious medical issues to focus on here are his poorly controlled HTN, which I suspect is the primary cause of his HA, and his uncontrolled DM, of which he obviously does not yet understand the import and does not seem likely to comply with insulin treatment without further education. \n\n\n\nIn any case, I find no acute neurological issues. \n\n\n\nRecs: \n\n-BP management\n\n-DM management. \n\n\n\nThanks for this interesting consult. \n\nCase/plan discussed w/ KEKELA neurology attending by phone, Dr. Ivan Guy. \n\nCall w/ questions 86383. \n\n\n\nKeith Gilbert, MD, PhD, \n\nNeurology resident PGY3\n\n\n\nAddendum: \n\nHe did not mention this when I questioned him and wife about PMH, but digging through prior LMR notes I find this addition to his PMH: \n\nA note from Dr. Robert Irish, neurosurgery, from 3/2099 notes that he is s/p &#8220;cervical laminectomy and foramen magnum resection followed by removal of an intramedullary tumor near his foramen magnum.  He is doing much better today.  He states that his headaches are considerably better, and the left hemibody dysesthesias are much better tolerated since the initiation of Neurontin.&#8221;"}

The \n\npatient had onset of her symptoms approximately two hours prior to \n\narrival.  The patient denies any change in sensation but she \n\ndefinitely did notice weakness with decreased ability to control \n\nher left side extremities.  The patient states that her left arm \n\ncontrol was regained after approximately one or two hours.  Her \n\nleft leg control is better but still is not back to baseline.  \n\nReview of systems, family history and social history as per the \n\nresident's note.\n\nPAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus, \n\nhypertension.\n\nMEDICATIONS:  Insulin, Diltiazem, labetalol.\n\nALLERGIES:  TETANUS.\n\nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  This is a well-developed, well-nourished \n\nfemale, in mild distress, appears concerned.  Temperature is 96.9 \n\ndegrees, pulse 65, respiratory rate of 18, blood pressure is \n\n163/104.  Repeat blood pressure is 174/80.  Oxygen saturation is \n\n97% on room air.  HEENT:  Normocephalic, atraumatic.  Pupils are \n\nequally round and reactive to light and accommodation.  Extraocular \n\nmotions are intact.  No nystagmus.  NECK:  Supple with full range \n\nof motion.  2+ carotids, no bruits.  CARDIAC:  Regular rate and \n\nrhythm.  EXTREMITIES:  No clubbing, cyanosis or edema.  Extremities \n\nare nontender to palpation throughout.  NEURO:  Alert, oriented x \n\n3.  Follows commands, appropriate.  Cranial nerves II-XII are \n\nintact.  There is 5/5 motor strength in individual motor group \n\ntesting of the upper extremities and lower extremities bilaterally. \n\nThe patient is unable to stand without assistance.  Comprehension \n\nis within normal limits.  Further details of the physical \n\nexamination are as per the resident's note.\n\nLABORATORY EVALUATION:  Labs are significant for a glucose of 162, \n\nBUN of 20, creatinine 1.3, sodium 145, potassium 4.2, chloride 108, \n\nbicarb 26, calcium 9.4.  White count is 8.1, hematocrit 39.0, \n\nplatelets 341.  A UA shows no blood, no leucocyte esterase, no \n\nketones.  Head CT shows no acute intracranial abnormality and mild \n\ninvolutional changes.  EKG shows a sinus rhythm at 57 beats per \n\nminute with non-specific T wave changes.  This is compared to an \n\nEKG from 2068 and was found to be without significant change.\n\nTHERAPY RENDERED/COURSE IN ED:  The patient was seen and evaluated \n\nin the Emergency Department with labs and studies obtained as \n\ndocumented above.  The initial concerns were for a focal seizure \n\nversus a TIA.  The patient was hypertensive on her arrival and, \n\ntherefore, received labetalol for improved blood pressure control \n\nand the Neurology Service was consulted early in the patient's \n\ncare.  The patient does not have any evidence of focal motor group \n\nweakness at this time, nor sensation changes.  The patient will \n\nrequire admission to the Neurology Service for further workup of \n\nher seizure versus TIA.\n\nFINAL DIAGNOSIS:  TIA.\n\nDISPOSITION (including condition upon discharge):  The patient is \n\nadmitted to the hospital in satisfactory condition.\n\n___________________________________                    OH527/2519 \n\nYULIANNA ELKINS, M.D.   YE96                            D:01/24/73 \n\n                                                       T:01/24/73 \n\nDictated by:  YULIANNA ELKINS, M.D.   YE96 \n\n ******** Not reviewed by Attending Physician ********\nRecord date: 2079-09-01\n\n \n\nRheumatology Consult Note\n\nName: Mullins, Dolores U\nMRN: 72841920\nDOB: 06/06/02\nLocation: 78Q-47-4\nConsult date: 09/01/79\nReferring Physician: Gay Langley\nSource of history: patient interview, medical records\nCode status: Full\n\nReason for Consult: bilateral LE pain up to knees\nHPI:\n77 yo F w/h/o type I DM and HTN.  At the beginning of this year, she began to have intermittent    burning    pain of her feet and sometimes her lower legs/feet.  This pain typically occurred on one leg more than the other, without an overall predominance of one side.  In the past month, she has had continuous, bilateral    burning    pain that began in both feet.  Several weeks ago, her pain worsened considerably such that she was having difficulty shopping.  Around this time, the pain spread up her legs to above her knees.  She also noted having difficulty putting on shoes and was told by a friend that her feet were swollen (she is unable to see her feet due to blindness).  Her pain continued to worsen until the night prior to admission, when she was in her bathroom and found herself in such pain that she was unable to get up to leave the bathroom.  A friend found her after 8 hours and EMS was called.  In the ED, she was found to have BP elevated to 190, Cr elevated to 2.8, FSG down to 51, and R-sided hydronephrosis.  Labetolol/diltiazem were given for HTN with good response, IV hydration was given with subsequent decline in Cr, and Foley was placed with resolution of hydronephrosis on subsequent MRI.   \n\nShe has never had    burning    pain of the kind that she presented with prior to this year.  Of note, she has had    years    of tingling without numbness in her lower extremities bilaterally extending to above her knees.  She also notes numbness of the tips of her R 2nd-4th digits.  ROS positive for subjective decline in urine output and constipation (1 BM/2days).  She denies fever/chills/sweats, recent weight loss, fatigue, hypoglycemic episodes, cough/rhinorrhea/sore throat, SOB, orthpnea, CP, palpitations, abdominal pain, diarrhea, dysuria, polyuria/polydipsia.  \n\nPMH: \n1) DM     type 1, since 2060, c/b retinopathy, nephropathy\n2) HTN\n3) Hypercholesterolemia\n4) L internal capsule CVA 11/72\n5) L eye legally blind 2/2 open angle glaucoma\n6) thyroid nodule 7/78        benign    per patient\n7) CRI     per HHMR, Cr 1.4 (4/78, 1/79) and 1.84 on 6/29/79\n\nPSH:\n1) bilateral cataracts\n2) L eye    glaucoma    surgery\n3) L eye    pressure shunt   \n4) TAH at age 25\n\n\n\n\nAdmission Meds:\n1) Labetalol 200 mg bid\n2) HCTZ 25 mg qd\n3) Lovastatin 20 mg qd\n4) Enalapril 20 mg qd\n5) Diltiazem 120 mg bid\n6) ASA 81 mg qd\n7) Novolin 10 U qam\n8) NPH 70 U qam, 40 U qpm\n\nInpatient Meds: \n1) Ferrous sulphate 325 po tid\n2) Enoxaparin 30 sc qd\n3) Simvastatin 40 po qhs\n4) Diltiazem SR 120 po bid\n5) Labetolol 200 mg bid\n6) Novolog SS ac, RISS qhs\n7) NPH 70 U qam, 30 U qpm\n8) Regular Insulin 10 U qam\n9) Colchicine 0.6 mg qd (2 doses given)\n10) Lumigan ou 1 drop qd\n11) Prednisolone 1% 1 drop au bid\n12) Colace 100 mg po bid\n13) ASA 81 mg po qd\n14) Oxycodone 10 mg po q6h prn\nGabapentin 100 mg tid     5 doses given before being discontinued\n\nAllergies: NKDA\n\nSH: Never smoked, does not currently drink ETOH, no h/o substance abuse, lives on the 2nd floor of an apartment (15 steps) and has neighbors who check in on her.

She was found to have exquisitely tender joints up to and including her knees with visible synovial effusions of her knees bilaterally.  Aspiration of one of her knees revealed needle-shaped negatively birefringent crystals, diagnostic of gout.  This is consistent with her elevated uric acid and her elevated markers of inflammation (ESR/CRP).  Given that she has a long history of symptoms of LE diabetic neuropathy and that she has some diffuse soft tissue tenderness, she may also have some pain from diabetic neuropathy that may declare itself after her gout is treated.  However, her current inability to walk can be clearly attributed to gout.  \n\nRecs:\n- Solumedrol 40 mg bid IV, prednisone 40 mg qd starting tomorrow with 12-day outpatient taper (40 mg x 3 days, 30 mg x 3 days, 20 mg x 3 days, 10 mg x 3 days)\n- Colchicine po 0.6 mg qd for 2 weeks, then 0.6 mg qod for 2 weeks\n- Continue to hold HCTZ     discuss with PCP need to restart as outpatient as it is a risk factor for hyperuricemia\n- F/u with rheumatology in 4 weeks for initiation of allopurinol (please arrange appointment w/ Dr. Yau)\n\n\n\nProcedure: R knee aspiration\nPatient was informed of the risks of bleeding and infection and gave consent. The medial aspect of the right knee was sterilized using iodine swabs x3, sterile gloves used in a one-handed sterile lateral approach. 1.5cc of 1% lidocaine was injected to raise a wheal inferior to the R patella. A 18G needle was inserted into the knee and approximately 20cc of opaque, yellow fluid was withdrawn. A slide was prepared and examined under the microscope by myself, Dr. Yau, and Dr. Woodard.  Abundant intracellular and extracellular needle-shapped negatively birefringent crystals were observed.  Synovial fluid sample was also submitted for culture, Gram stain, cell count, and crystal analysis.\n\n\n\n__________________________________\nIsaac Ito, MS4 x79975\n\n\nAddendum:\nPatient seen, records reviewed, case reviewed with medical student.

The patient has\n\nbeen in Southwest Montana for the last several weeks.  During her\n\nrehabilitation stay, the patient was noted to have sinus\n\nbradycardia and sinus pauses.  The patient's metoprolol was\n\nstopped.  The patient was previously on metoprolol 6.25 mg every\n\n6 hours.  The patient was noted to have atrial fibrillation with\n\nrapid ventricular response on exam this morning.  The patient is\n\nfollowed by Dr. Octavia Xue of Heritage Hospital Cardiology. \n\nGiven the difficulty that Southwest Montana has had ____\n\nthe patient's atrial fibrillation, the patient was transferred\n\nhere to Riverton General Hospital for further management and\n\nfurther placement.  The patient is asymptomatic.  The patient\n\ndenies any chest pain or shortness of breath.  The patient denies\n\nany lightheadedness.  The patient has no other complaints.\n\nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  The patient's vital signs revealed the\n\nfollowing:  Temperature is 96.4, heart rate of 79, respiratory\n\nrate of 18, blood pressure is 112/63, and oxygen saturations at\n\n100% on room air.

No rebound or guarding. \n\nMinimal suprapubic tenderness to palpation.  G-tube in place. \n\nRectal exam:  Deferred.  GU exam:  Deferred.  Skin:  Warm and\n\ndry.  No rash or lesions were noted.  Back:  No costovertebral\n\nangle tenderness.  Extremities:  Warm and well perfused.  Lower\n\nextremity pitting edema rising up to the knees.  No palpable\n\ncords.  Neurologic:  The patient was alert and oriented.  The\n\npatient moved all 4 extremities with fair strength.  The patient\n\ndid have a right facial droop.  I did not ambulate the patient.\n\nINITIAL IMPRESSION AND PLAN:  The patient is a 78-year-old female\n\nwith history of atrial fibrillation, and recent left MCA stroke\n\nwho was transferred from Southwest Montana for management\n\nof her atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response.  The\n\npatient is hemodynamically stable at this time.  The patient is\n\nasymptomatic.  The patient will need rate control and will need\n\nto be admitted to Heritage Hospital Cardiology.\n\nEMERGENCY DEPARTMENT COURSE:  Upon arrival to the Emergency\n\nDepartment, the patient had history and physical exam performed. \n\nThe patient then had 12-lead EKG performed.  The patient's\n\n12-lead EKG was notable for atrial fibrillation with rapid\n\nventricular response.  The patient did have some nonspecific ST-T\n\nchanges when compared to her prior EKG.  The patient's laboratory\n\nstudies so far has been largely unremarkable.  The patient's\n\nfirst set of cardiac markers were negative.  The patient's\n\ncomplete blood count was notable for an elevated white blood cell\n\ncount of 10.8.  The patient's hematocrit of 33.2.  The patient's\n\nplatelets were somewhat elevated at 560,000.  The patient's\n\nportable chest x-ray has been ordered and results of the\n\npatient's portable chest x-ray are still pending at this time. \n\nThe case was then discussed with the Heritage Hospital\n\ncardiologist on call.  The patient ____ will be admitted to\n\nHeritage Hospital Cardiology and to a monitor bed.  I did try to\n\npage Dr. Octavia Xue to let her know about the patient's\n\nadmission to Heritage Hospital Cardiology.  The patient and\n\npatient's family were in agreement with the plan.  The patient\n\nwas started on metoprolol down her G-tube.  The patient had a\n\ngood response to the metoprolol.  The patient was given\n\nmetoprolol 6.25 mg.\n\nPRIMARY DIAGNOSES:\n\n1.  Atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response.\n\n2.  History of a left MCA stroke.\n\nDISPOSITION:  The patient was admitted to Heritage Hospital\n\nCardiology.\n\nCONDITION AT TIME OF DISPOSITION:  Stable and satisfactory.\n\n______________________________\n\nTAVARES, IDRIS M.D.\n\nD: 07/19/80\n\nT: 07/19/80\n\nDictated By: TAVARES, IDRIS\n\neScription document:4-5337537 BFFocus\n\n ******** Not reviewed by Attending Physician ********"}

We increased his 70/30 insulin from 30 to 35U BID last month.  He has been keeping track of sugars at least BID since then.  He still has the majority of sugars in the low 200 range, some in the 300's, a few in the 100's.  Interestingly, his fasting sugars are for the most part higher than his daytime sugars.  He has not been adhering to a good diabetes diet - he enjoys a blueberry muffin from RR Donnelley daily.  His daughter-in-law who is also my patient has told me that he eats anything he wants and all the wrong things.  I addressed this issue w/ Mr. Oshea.  He says he tries, but he enjoys these things and feels he doesn't have much else in life to enjoy.  He is worried about his remaining vision.  He was told by Dr. Villagomez that the pressure in his L eye was unusually high.  She wants to see him back again this month for another exam and wants him to bring his eye drops.  He also is having trouble sleeping.  He never had a great sleep pattern since he worked as a Senior Manager of Broadcasting and was up at all hours.  He has no trouble falling asleep, but wakes up about 2 a.m. every morning and can't fall back asleep.  He does take naps in the afternoon at times.\n\n\n\nProblems\n\n      H/O Cerebrovascular accident    : unclear when; pt describes as mild stroke; was started on dipyrimadole at that time by neurologist.\n\n      Diabetes mellitus\n\n      Hypertension\n\n      Glaucoma\n\n      Visual impairment    : pt legally blind\n\n      Retinopathy    : s/p multiple laser surg; legally blind\n\n      Benign prostatic hypertrophy    : followed by Dr. Landers\n\n\n\nMedications\n\n      Artificial Tears   2 DROP OS TID \n\n      TRAZODONE   50MG TABLET take 1 Tablet(s) PO QHS PRN insomnia \n\n      Timolol Maleate 0.5%   2 DROP OU BID \n\n      Insulin 70/30 Human   35 UNITS SC BID \n\n      DIPYRIDAMOLE   75MG TABLET take 2 Tablet(s) PO TID \n\n      Enalapril Maleate   20MG TABLET take 1 Tablet(s) PO BID x 90 days\n\n      Metoprolol Tartrate   50MG TABLET take 1 Tablet(s) PO BID x 90 days\n\n      Lipitor (ATORVASTATIN)   10MG TABLET take 1 Tablet(s) PO QD \n\n      Ambien (ZOLPIDEM Tartrate)   5 MG (5MG TABLET take 1) PO QHS PRN insomnia \n\n      Proscar (FINASTERIDE)   5 MG (5MG TABLET take 1) PO QD \n\n      Flomax (TAMSULOSIN)   0.4 MG (0.4MG CAP.SR 24H take 1) PO QD \n\n\n\nAllergies\n\n      NKA\n\n\n\nSocial History\n\nlanguage: English\n\nliving: w/ son and his wife; pt's wife passed away; moved here from NY in 12/2084\n\nwork: retired Senior Manager of Broadcasting\n\ntobacco: 2 ppd x 24 yrs; quit age 39\n\nEtOH:  remote hx heavy use; quit age 39\n\ndrug: none\n\nsexual: not active\n\ndomestic violence: neg\n\n\n\nReview of Systems\n\n Denies headache, visual change, confusion, focal weakness or paresthesias; denies chest pain, sob, change in exercise tolerance, pedal edema, orthopnea; denies symptoms of hypoglycemia; does have frequent urination, some urinary incontinence despite meds.\n\n\n\nVital Signs\n\n      BLOOD PRESSURE   124/60 \n\n      PULSE   72 \n\n      WEIGHT   238 lb\n\n\n\nPhysical Exam\n\nGen: obese man, NAD, appears tired today\n\nHEENT: PERRL, EOM intact, oral mucosa moist, no lesions\n\nNeck: supple, no LAN, no masses\n\nLungs: clear bilat\n\nCV: RRR, nl S1, S2, no M/R/G\n\nExtrem: no edema; radial and p.t. pulses 2+ bilat\n\n\n\nAssessment and Plan\n\n75 y.o. man w/ DM type 2, HTN, hyperlipidemia, BPH, legally blind, still w/ elevated blood sugars.\n\n1) DM: emphasized to pt the importance of diet in controlling blood sugar; he says he will make an honest attempt to do better; will recheck HbA1c in April; he will continue to monitor blood sugars at home; has appt w/ Dr. Villagomez of MEDIQUIK this month, is up to date w/ podiatry.\n\n\n\n2) hyperlipidemia: will recheck fasting lipids in April; continue lipitor.\n\n\n\n3) HTN: good control today; continue enalapril, metoprolol.\n\n\n\n4) BPH: followed by Dr. Landers; has f/u w/ him later this year.\n\n\n\n5) insomnia: early morning waking difficult to treat w/ a pill; despite my discussion w/ pt regarding this, he would like to try Ambien.

Pt lives with daughter-in-law and grandchildren, who were both recently sick and recovering from influenza.  The pt began to have a non-productive cough associated with a fever (101o-102o), watery eyes, diaphoresis, and chills early this week after his family was sick.  His daughter-in-law states that he has also been increasingly confused during this time period.  He has been confusing the time of day (confusing night for daytime and vice versa), increasingly forgetful, and falling more than usual.  He has been falling with increasing frequency over the last 3 months.  On average, he would fall about once a week.  On the day prior to admission, the pt walked to Procter Gamble (2 blocks from house) and fell twice.  He was helped back up by by-standers.  He describes the fall as his legs giving out from under him, and has been shuffling his gait more than usual recently.  During each fall he denies LOC, denies CP, denies, SOB, denies incontinence, and denies head trauma.  On the day of presentation, the daughter-in-law reports that the pt fell 13 times and when she could no longer help him rise called EMS.\n\n\n\nEW Vital signs:  T:98.6o, P:99, BP:174/65, RR:20, SaO2: 91% on RA\n\nEW: After the pt presented to the EW, he tested positive for influenza A and was treated supportively.

She\nhas stenosis in both anterior and posterior circulation. \nPast right carotid endarterectomy.  \n\nIn August 2095, she was admitted to BMH with a right\ncerebellar stroke, complicated by a brief intubation and\npneumonia.  She underwent stenting of her right vertebral\nartery and left common carotid artery.  She had subsequent\nepisodes of worsening speech, and was started on Coumadin,\nwith an INR goal of 2.5 to 3.0.  She is followed closely by\nNeurology and may, at some point, undergo further\ninterventional radiology procedures, to be determined.  \n\nDuring her most recent hospitalization she had some\nconfusion which was attributed to low sodium.  This was\nfelt to be the result of osmotic diuresis, and possible\nSIADH.  This is being treated with salt tablets, saline\nboluses in her G-tube, water restriction, and low-dose\nLasix.  No evidence of adrenal insufficiency.  \n\nSince leaving the hospital, she has had ongoing weight loss.\n Baseline weight 170 pounds.  Weight in early September, 167\npounds.  Weight October 20th, 160 pounds.  Weight November \n\n28th, 141 pounds.  Weight today in clinic 146 pounds on our scale.  \n\nShe had a swallowing study on October 26, 2095, which\nrevealed no aspiration, but very poor bolus formation.  The\nG-tube was placed in August, and has healed well, but has\nnever been used for daily tube feeds on an outpatient basis.\n Over the past couple of weeks, she has worsening trouble\nwith coughing, choking and sputtering, as she attempts to\nswallow.  Her caloric p.o. intake sounds as if it has been\nquite minimal, with a couple of ounces of potatoes or pureed\nfoods here and there.  She is drinking two or three can of\nbooster Ensure daily, but clearly not meeting her caloric\nneeds.  Today's visit was with the patient, and her daughter\n(phone number 507.741.8042).  \n\nMost recent laboratory studies, done 12/7/2095: Sodium 137,\npotassium 4.8, chloride 95, Bicarb 32, BUN 22, creatinine\n1.0, calcium 9.9, glucose 162.  \n\nThe patient has felt increasingly weak and debilitated, as\nher weight has decreased.  \n\nREVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  Also remarkable for slight bright red\nblood per rectum within the last week.  The patient's\ndaughter describes that she had a normal colonoscopy in\nearly 2095, at the Richwood Area Community Hospital.  The\npatient's daughter will bring me these records at the next\nvisit. \n\nPAST MEDICAL HISTORY:\n1. Cerebrovascular disease, as noted above. \n2. Throat cancer in early 2060s.  Status post XRT to the\nneck (may have predisposed her to the severe carotid and\nvertebral disease).\n3. Breast cancer.  Details unknown.  Will review at next\nvisit. \n4. Diabetes, type II.  On glyburide.  Further details\nunknown. \n5. SIADH.  Will review hospital chart in detail. \n6. Hypertension.  Per Neurology, goal blood pressure 140 to\n170.  \n7. Hypothyroidism.  Details unknown.  Recent TSH normal.  \n8. Glaucoma. \n9. Anxiety.  Being followed by Psychiatry on an active\nbasis.  This was apparently a large factor during her recent\nhospitalizations.  \n10. Possible recent anemia.  Has not been evaluated thus\nfar.  \n\nMEDICATIONS:\n1. Lisinopril 40 mg p.o. q.d.\n2. Synthroid 100 mcg p.o. q.d.\n3. Lasix 10 mg p.o. Qa m and Qpm\n4. Glyburide 5 mg p.o. b.i.d.\n5. Colace 100 mg p.o. b.i.d. to t.i.d.\n6. Enteric-coated baby aspirin 81 mg p.o. q.d.\n7. Sodium chloride 1 g p.o. Qa m via G-tube\n8.

PRN\n\nALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.  \n\nSOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient has four children.  Her\ndaughter Fitzpatrick is a Food Service Supervisor.  Another daughter is staying with the\npatient full-time.  Visiting nurse is involved.  Previous to\nthe last few months, the patient was fairly independent. \n\nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  \nGENERAL:  Cachectic, anxious woman, who is slightly unsteady\non her feet, but safe with ambulation if she moves slowly\nand carefully.  Has a cane, but does not always use it.  \nVITAL SIGNS:  BP 214/108, initially (patient very anxious),\nand 171/74 on repeat.  Pulse 80.  Weight 146.5 pounds, fully\nclothed.  \nABDOMEN:  With good bowel sounds.  Soft, nontender and\nnondistended.  No hepatosplenomegaly.  No masses.  G-tube is\nflushed with water, and flushes easily.  G-tube site itself\nis well-healed and nontender, with no pussy discharge.  \nLUNGS:  Clear to auscultation.  \nHEART:  Regular rate and rhythm.  No murmurs.  \n\nASSESSMENT AND PLAN: \n1. Weight loss.  Probably due to poor caloric intake.  This\nis a significant health concern for her, as she has become\nprogressively cachectic and weak.  This is probably\nattributed to, by some extent, her progressive dysphagia. \nShe is referred urgently to Nutrition, and will see them on\nTuesday.  I suggested to the daughter and to the nutritionist\nthat we transition her to tube feeds for at least a couple\nof weeks, to get her muscle mass up, and then reevaluate. \nShe should continue to take p.o. foods as tolerated, but she\nneeds to attempt to meet her caloric intake via the G-tube,\nsince she is clearly not meeting it p.o.  Will try Glucerna\nbecause of her diabetes history.  The patient's daughter and\nthe nutritionist are aware of her issues with vitamin K and\nCoumadin, and they will discuss this further when she sees\nNutrition Clinic in two days.  \n2. Cerebrovascular disease.  Followed closely by Neurology. \nNo acute change in neuro status today.  Will continue\nCoumadin.  Being followed closely by Internal Medicine for\nthis.  Recent INR 1.4.  Will adjust Coumadin as advised by\nIM nurse.  \n3. SIADH.  I need to review these records more closely, and\ntry to make sure there is no other underlying disorder.  In\nthe meantime, her sodiums have been quite good recently. \n4. Diabetes.  Recent hyperglycemia, with sugars in the 300\nto 350 range.  Most recently, with sugars in the 100 to 200\nrange over the past few days.  Continue glyburide 5 mg p.o.\nb.i.d.  Finger-sticks three to four times daily.  Further\nadjustments PRN.  Our current goal is simply to maintain her\nsugars between 120 and approximately 220 to 250.  Once her\ndietary issues are stabilized, we can aim for slightly\ntighter control.  Wish to avoid hypoglycemia, given her\ntroubles with p.o. intake.    \n5. Recent history of bright red blood per rectum.  Daughter\nwill bring me her recent colonoscopy report, and we will\ntake it from there. \n6. Constipation.  Continue Colace.  Add Dulcolax PRN. \nContinue Fleet Enema PRN by visiting nurse.  If she does\nhave chronic constipation, this may impact her appetite and\nher ability to eat successfully.  \n7. Hypertension.  Currently in reasonable control.  Goal BP\n140 to 170, systolic.  Initial severe hypertension this\nvisit, attributed to anxiety, which clearly is a major issue\nfor her.  Follow-up at next visit. \n8. Anxiety.  Followed by Psychiatry.  Extensive reassurance\ngiven today to the patient.  She is very concerned about her\nweight loss, as am I.  I tried to reassure her that we would\ntake this seriously and address it in a very rapid fashion. \n\nAddendum - spoke with psych - they will start paxil 5 mg qd\n\nwatch for worsening SIADH and/or anthicholinergic side effects.\n9. Multiple other issues.  To be addressed at further\nvisits.  Given her weight loss and complexity, I will see\nher on a weekly basis for the next few weeks, or sooner PRN.\n Daughter has my pager number, and knows how to reach me.\n\n\n______________________________\nJulia Yale, M.D.\n\n\nCC:\n\neScription document:0-136282 ST eScription\n\nDD: 12/09/95\nDT: 12/09/95\nDV: 12/09/95\nRecord date: 2097-11-30\n\n\nCookson Memorial Home\nInternal Medicine Room 960\n50 Wellesley Rd                                        DARLING, BETTY\nSeattle, SC 84126                                      78567873\n(121) 537-3484                                           11/30/97\n\n\nCHIEF COMPLAINT:  Hypertension, proteinuria, status post fall,\nreevaluate Coumadin.\n\nHISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Urgent care visit for this\n77-year-old woman with the history of diabetes, multiple strokes,\nhypertension, hyperlipidemia, and multiple other issues.  Last\nweek she was at Saint Joseph Memorial Hospital for an eye evaluation.\n It was a very very windy day.  Afterwards she was outside and a\nhuge gust of wind knocked her over.  Her daughter Fitzpatrick was with\nher and Fitzpatrick herself actually had to hold on to something when\nthe wind blew.  There is no chest pain or presyncope, and no loss\nof consciousness either before, during, or after the episode. \nShe struck her left trochanteric area, left deltoid area, and\nleft eyebrow.  She was taken to EFH where she had a normal head\nCT.  A single stitch was placed in the laceration along the\nlateral edge of her left eyebrow.  She had films of her wrist and\nhips both of which were fine.  She has bruising in these areas. \nOther than some pain where the bruising is she feels entirely\nback to normal.\n\nShe had marked hypertension up to 250.  She was treated with\nhydralazine in the ER, and was noted to have proteinuria with\nsome hematuria.  Her blood pressure at home since then has been\n180 and 210 systolic on her usual 40 mg daily of lisinopril.  She\nis not on a beta-blocker currently.  She has not had any episodes\nof chest pain.  She does feel slightly more woozy than usual.\n\nMEDICATIONS:  Metformin 500 mg p.o. b.i.d., Prevacid 30 mg p.o.\nq.d., atorvastatin 10 mg q.d., sertraline 50 mg q.d., warfarin,\nlisinopril 40 mg q.d., Ambien 10 mg q.h.s. p.r.n., levothyroxine\n100 mg p.o. q.d., aspirin, eyedrops, Colace, and Dulcolax.\n\nSOCIAL HISTORY:  She is looking forward to a good Christmas. \nShe is here today with her daughter Fitzpatrick.\n\nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Temperature 97.2, pulse 74, BP 208/66,\nweight 148 pounds.\nGENERAL: Well appearing woman.\nHEENT: PERRL.  Single stitch along the lateral aspect of her left\neyebrow is easily removed.  No evidence of any infection.  Her\nleft deltoid area is fine and she has good range of motion in the\nshoulder.  Her left ribcage is slightly tender but without any\nbony step-offs.  She walks well with no pain in her left hip. \nThere is a hand sized deep purple bruise over the trochanteric\nbursa.\n\nASSESSMENT AND PLAN:  Mechanical fall with laceration and\nbruising but no more serious complications.  Fortunately she did\nnot have intracranial bleeding.  I am not sure why her blood\npressure is up, whether this is related to the stress of the\nfalls verses independent causes.  Given that the high blood\npressure has persisted, I will add atenolol 12.5 mg p.o. q.d.,\nand discuss via phone or E-mail with her daughter next week to\nsee how well this is working.  Goal BP 140-160 systolic.  Her\nurine was checked today.  Hematuria has resolved.  She has 2+\nproteinuria.  I will recheck this in a week or two after we treat\nher hypertension.\n\nWe spent over half of today's 45-minute visit discussing risks\nand benefits of Coumadin therapy.  Although she is at risk for\nfalls, she feels quite clearly that she prefers to be on the\nCoumadin due to her fear of having a repeated thrombotic stroke. \nShe feels that she has not had any bleeding complications, and\nthat she really would not like to suffer through another stroke. \nI explained that there was some risk with falls of intracranial\nhemorrhage and its consequences.  I spoke with Dr. Dewitt last\nmonth about her Coumadin, and we both feel that it seems to be\nworking well in terms of stroke prevention, but that she is at\nincreased risk for falls.  It seems to me that she is in a gray\narea with no clear right answer in terms of risk benefit analysis\nfor Coumadin for her.  She feels very strongly that she wishes to\ncontinue.  This was discussed in detail with her and her\ndaughter, and this probably is a reasonable decision.  I\nencouraged her to restart physical therapy to work on her\nstrength and hopefully diminish her risk of a subsequent fall. \nMore than half of today's 45-minute visit spent in patient\ncounseling and education.\n\n\n\n\n\n______________________________\nJulia Yale, M.D.\n\n\nDictated By: Julia Yale\n\n\neScription document:3-5285833 EMSSten Tel\n\n\n\nDD: 11/30/97\nDT: 11/30/97\nDV: 11/30/97\nRecord date: 2098-06-13\n\nBetty has been doing \"okay\" since our last visit; she continues to report a slow decline in swallowing ability.  She had a video swallow at SJMH; she and Fitzpatrick were told that the underlying problem was local changes due to her radiation.  Her gait has been unchanged, but she still feels it has deteriorated a little over the last year.\n\n\n\nShe is gardening, and trying to stay active; she has had no falls and uses a cane.\n\n\n\nShe recently added amlodipine for her hypertension.\n\n\n\n\n\nEchocardiogram:\n\nDate: 9/02/95: borderline LVH, preserved EF.

The estimation of stenosis in the left internal carotid artery may be low because of tandem stenoses in the left carotid artery.  Compared to the study of 9/04/95, the LICA lesion is modestly worse. >50% in B ECAs.\n\n9/26/95: Lbif stenosis >= 50%.  Rbif without significant stenosis.  RVA dominant.\n\n  \t  \t  \t  \t  \t  \tUltrasound:\n\n8/24/95: Low RCCA 50-75%, Mid LCCA 75-90%, calcified LICA possibly >50%\n\n  \t  \t  \t  \t  \t  \tAngiography:\n\n8/27/95: proximal RCCA stenosis >80%, ACA cross-filling from L-->R.

Cognitively, she appears unchanged; her speech is fluent, with intact repetition and comprehension, and her recall of recent events (corroborated by her daughter) is good.\n\n\n\nPupils are equal and reactive, EOMI, VFFTC.  Face, tongue and palate are symmetric, but she is dysarthric; glottal sounds worst.  This sounds slightly worse than our previous visit.  Strength is full in all extremities; her mild dysmetria is unchanged.  Her walk, always wide-based and slightly unsteady, appears mildly worse than our previous visit, but she is not using a cane, and is able to catch herself after mild stumbles.  She is unable to tandem gait.\n\n\n\nImpression:\n\nBetty is a 78 year old woman with progressive cerebrovascular disease due to local radiation, plus diabetes, hypertension, hyperlipidemia.  She is s/p left ICA stents and right VA angioplasty.  Her most significant vascular lesion is stenosis proximal to the ICA stent, but there is no hint now of transient or orthostatic symptoms.\n\n\n\nMy continued feeling is that we ought to focus on her controllable risk factors, such as diabetes, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, as you are doing.  I understand you have recently been adjusting her antihypertensive regimen.  I would recommend a goal systolic blood pressure no lower than 120 mmHg.\n\n\n\nI think a reasonable way to approach this is to use (1) her clinical status, and (2) 'functional' imaging, such as Diamox SPECT, to follow her cerebrovascular disease.  I think intervention would be warranted if there were a deterioration in one of these parameters.\n\n\n\nI have not yet heard from Howard Yelverton about his thoughts regarding the recent scan, but I did review the CT scans with neuroradiology.  Our impression is that, while the wording of the reports seems to suggest significant progression of the LICA stenosis, it's not significant enough to prompt us to act, in the absence of symptomatic or functional changes.\n\n\n\nI am ordering a Diamox SPECT scan, since the previous one was in July of last year.\n\n\n\nThis is my last general neurology clinic at BMH; I will be a neuromuscular fellow here next year.  While I can be available for questions or concerns, I will be referring Betty's care to one of the more junior residents.\n\n\n\n________________________\n\nElvin Cox MD, MBA\n\nBMH Neurology"}

The patient is interviewed and available records are reviewed.  In February, she developed left leg weakness on arising one morning.  There was also some possible ataxia of the left upper extremity with decreased control of both the arm and the leg.  This seemed to occur for two days in a row and on one occasion, she fell getting out of bed.  The symptoms resolved before she could be evaluated.  She attributed the symptoms to not enough air pressure in her air mattress and once this was corrected, she feels that the event has not re-occured.\n\nThe second event was apparently associated with some left facial weakness as well.\n\nShe was seen by Neurology on 02/10/43 after she was admitted.  The history includes also lightheadedness and foggy vision per that report.  Initially MRI of the head showed no acute events but did show a change in the right posterior cerebral artery and a lesion in the left temporal lobe.  Also, in the record is noted that at the time of the second event, her glucose was very low at around 32 and symptoms resolved after treatment with D50.  There was also further history that the patient had been seeing a chiropractor for treatment of neck pain in the several months leading up to the event.\n\nOn examination at the time of admission, there were no clear findings.  MRI was said to show periventricular white matter changes.  The area of abnormality adjacent to the left lateral ventricle was thought to perhaps represent an old prior small hemorrhage.  MRA of the brain showed absence of visualization of the right PCA about 1 cm beyond its origin but MRA of the neck showed no significant changes.  Subsequent echocardiogram showed mild LVH with no evidence of a shunt.\n\nCurrently, the patient is asymptomatic and presents for routine followup.  It has been unclear what the cause of her symptoms was.  Some have attributed the symptoms to hypoglycemia and another formulation was that of a thalamic TIA given the changes in the right PCA on MRA.  Another consideration was dissection from manipulation by the chiropractor.  There is no clinical history to go with the possible old small hemorrhage.\n\nREVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  Notable for multifocal muscle aches and a chronic cough.  The patient also has some shortness of breath but there is no report of chest pain or fever or chills.  There are no medication allergies reported.\n\nPAST FAMILY/SOCIAL HISTORY:  Past medical history is notable for hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, spinal stenosis, diabetes, depression, neuropathy, anxiety, COPD, arthritis, and sinus symptoms.\n\nMEDICATIONS:  Lisinopril, Lopressor, glyburide, Naprosyn, Neurontin, Paxil, Lescol, Advair, trazodone, Glucophage, and ?___?.\n\nNot withstanding the above, the patient continues to smoke.  She uses alcohol occasionally.  She has a 12th grade education.  She lives alone and is a widow.\n\nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Blood pressure is 148/86, pulse 83 and regular, respirations 20.  The patient is overweight.  Height is 5 foot 3 inches.  Weight is 217 pounds.  Range of motion of the neck is reduced in all quadrants, though without clear spasm.  Poor neck posture is noted.  Funduscopic examination is normal with regard to disks and vessels.  Cardiovascular testing, carotids are 2+ without bruits.  Temporal arteries are normal.  Musculoskeletal testing, gait and station show a slight slowing of gait that has been present for years.  Romberg is negative.  Tandem gait is normal.  The patient does move slowly in general, this is probably not reflective of true bradykinesia.  There is some asymmetry of the shoulders with elevation on the right compared with the left.  This affects movements of the arms and range of motion of the arms but it appears to be orthopedic in nature and not neurologic.  There is no focal muscle weakness or atrophy noted.\n\nNEUROLOGICAL TESTING:  Mental status is essentially normal to orientation, memory, attention, language and fund of information.  Cranial nerve testing, pupils are 3 mm and briskly reactive.  Extraocular movements are full.  Visual fields are intact.  There is no facial sensory loss, but there is a mild facial asymmetry that did not look pathological.  Visual fields are intact.  Hearing is intact.  Oropharynx is normal.  Palate elevates well.  Tongue is midline.  Sensory testing shows absent vibration sensation in the feet bilaterally but sensory testing is otherwise intact.  Reflexes are absent in the lower extremities and 1+ in the upper extremities.  There is possible withdrawal at the left toe but the right toe seems downgoing.  Coordination testing today seemed intact.\n\nPrior neurologic evaluation from 02/10/43 is reviewed.  Homocystine level was elevated at 14, normal zero to ten.  Recommended treatment included folate, pyridoxine, and B12.\n\nIMPRESSION:  Transient neurologic symptoms, question etiology.  Comment.  I would agree with prior examiners that the symptoms probably do not relate to the position of the bed or air in the air mattress.  I do not think the symptoms are approximate enough to the chiropractic manipulation to be relevant.  Symptoms could have related to hypoglycemia or could have been vascular in nature.  In this regard, the PCA stenosis or occlusion may be relevant.  It is not immediately clear how to fit in the old hemorrhage.\n\nPLAN:  Although, she should be on some type of antiplatelet agent.  She was on aspirin at the time of the event and therefore would be considered an aspirin failure.  We therefore suggested Plavix 75 mg daily.  We were subsequently called by the pharmacy and informed that she is already on Aggrenox.  It probably does not matter which medication she chooses; however, she should be on one or the other and not both.  For treatment of the homocysteine level elevation, we have added simply multivitamins two daily.  I am not sure how significant this finding is in relation to the above symptoms.  She is advised to watch her glucose level and adjust medicines accordingly.  We have suggested a followup in Neurology in six months.\n\n\n______________________________\nRobert F Titus, MD\n\n\n\n\n\neScription document:0-9416184 IL\n\n\n\nDD: 04/11/43\nDT: 04/11/43\nDV: 04/03/43\nRecord date: 2145-07-25\n\n\n\nOlga comes in for 4 mo f/u.

She has also lost some weight (intentional) and states that, although she still gets short of breath with exertion, it is noticeably better.  She is being followed by the pulmonary department and is under consideration for a cardiopulmonary exercise test.\n\nFor her cough, the nexium has helped a lot and she likely has sig reflux despite the negative esophagram. The weight loss is probably helping with the gerd as well.\n\nRegarding her arthritis, he L shoulder pain is much improved with PT.  Her biggest complaint at the moment, though, is her low back pain. She was seen in pain clinic for two injections. She states that the injections may have helped for 1-2 days but then the pain returned. She says this is her most limiting symptom.

The patient has persistent presence of bacteria in his urine and there is a concern that he might have a persistent source of infection.  The patient denies fevers, chills, sweats, decrease in energy, loss of appetite, pain in the lower abdomen or penile discharge.  He reports there is some soreness around the meatus, which he attributes to self-catheterizing he is required to do 3 times a day.  He is well educated in terms of cleaning around the side and the appropriate way to do self-catheterization.   \nPAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Diabetes, hypertension, paraplegia secondary to unclear disk problems in 2107, right hip ulcer with trochanteric osteomyelitis in December 2118, treated with Unasyn x6 weeks and debridement and surgical flap, sacral decubiti in 2119 treated with Unasyn x6 weeks, local debridement healing by secondary intention.  No history of kidney stones.   \nSOCIAL:  Ex-tobacco use 2-3 packs per day, quit 25 years. Alcohol prior heavy use, quit 25 years.  Lives alone.  Prior work included Heavy-Duty Equipment Mechanic, Ironworker, as well as Electric Appliance Servicer.  \n \nALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.  \n \nMEDICATIONS:  Blood pressure medication, name unknown. Metformin.  Note, patient had been on Bactrim prophylaxis over the spring.   \nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Blood pressure 150/100, heart rate 100, temperature 97.9.  In general, vigorous, well-appearing man in wheelchair.  Awake and alert.  HEENT, sclerae anicteric.  Conjunctivae noninjected.  Neck supple.  No significant lymphadenopathy.  Chest, clear to auscultation bilaterally.  Cardiac, regular rate and rhythm.  No murmurs.  Abdomen benign.  Extremities, warm and well perfused.  No edema.  \n \nIMPRESSION:  Presence of bacteria in static urine within the bladder is not necessarily diagnostic as infection given patient's lack of symptoms and likely reflects colonization.   \nPLAN:  Would not treat patient with antibiotics unless he develops signs or symptoms of infection such as fevers, chills, sweats, elevated white blood cell count, pain in the suprapubic area or decreased energy.  \n \n_________________________ \nRosita Ko, M.D.  \n \nDD:10/23/2120 \nDT:10/24/2120 \nAO:29724     :0269\nRecord date: 2121-05-19\n\n\n\n\n\nInternal Medicine\n\nHOLY CROSS HOSPITAL\n\n\n\nHistory of present illness   The patient is a 72 year old male, with a past medical history of paraplegia (due to spinal ischemia), DMII, HTN, and recurrent UTI's, who came in for a follow up visit.

COMPARISON: 12/22/86          FINDINGS:     Lines/tubes:  None.          Lungs and pleura:  There is continued right mid and lower chest     opacity consistent with loculated pleural fluid and atelectasis.     This appearance of fluid has decreased slightly since the previous     study. There is no  pneumothorax. No focal consolidation is     demonstrated in the left hemithorax.  There may be a small     posterior left pleural effusion as well. There is subtle     suggestion of Kerley B lines at the lung bases consistent with     mild CHF.          Heart and mediastinum:  The heart and the mediastinum are     unchanged from the prior study. The aortic arch is calcified and     tortuous.          Bones:  The thoracic skeleton is unchanged from the prior study.          IMPRESSION:     Continued signs of atelectasis and pleural fluid involving     predominantly the right mid and lower hemithorax.  The appearance     of this has improved slightly since the prior exam.  No new focal     consolidation is demonstrated compared to the prior study.          There is subtle suggestion of Kerley B lines consistent with mild     CHF.     Plan:\n1. Recurrent pleural effusion: for repeat CT chest. Continue treatment for CAP.\n2. Hematuria: hold off Coumadin at present. Monitor Foley drainage. Consult Urology if no resolution. Otherwise for outpatient follow-up.\n3. Hodgkin's Lymphoma: Alert Dr Joyce of admission as courtesy.\n4. A Fib: rate controlled at present. Hold off Coumadin. \n5. HTN: BP poorly controlled. For admission anti-hypertensives. Monitor.\n6. Psych: he appears depressed. Likely reactive to current poor health. I will alert PCP.\n7. Code: FULL\n8.

She has described marked increased daytime sleepiness.  She essentially describes a nocturnal sleep pattern which involves \"sleeping around the clock\" during which time she may initiate sleep between 12:30 and 1:00 a.m., and after a couple awakenings, will wake up at 10:00 a.m., only to demonstrate frequent and often prolonged daytime naps of four hours duration.  The patient states she will waken for a couple of hours and then reinitiate sleep for an additional four hours.  She states that she is so tired that she can \"fall asleep right after breakfast\".  She then would get up for lunch and then go right back to sleep and sustain sleep until 3:00 p.m.  in the afternoon.  \n \nMs. Mckee also demonstrates a history of seizures initiated at 3 to 4 years of age, and was initially started on phenobarbital therapy.  She later switched to Dilantin therapy, but more recently and particularly since the mid 10's, she has been on Tegretol antiepileptic monotherapy 200 mg tablets, four tablets po q.a.m. and three tablets po q.h.s.  While Ms. Mckee also demonstrates both daytime and nocturnal seizures, there has been increased predilections for nocturnal seizures over the last year, and an increased amount of \"diffuse\" spike wave discharges are evident during light sleep, as detailed during a recent polysomnographic evaluation (please see below).  \n \nCURRENT MEDICATIONS:  Remeron, Celexa, Zestril, Prilosec, carbamazepine (200 mg tablets, four tablets in the morning and three tablets at night), clonazepam, hydrochlorothiazide, Premarin, tetracycline and klor-con.  \n \nALLERGIES:  No adverse drug allergies reported.  \n \nSLEEP HISTORY:  Sleep onset intended for 11:00 p.m. but the patient does not often sleep until 12:30 to 1:00 a.m.  She describes one to two early morning awakenings, with relative ease with regards to subsequent reinitiation and maintenance.  Sleep offset initially occurs at 8:30 to 9:00 a.m. and sometimes as late as 10:00 a.m.  The patient will then get up and right after breakfast fall asleep for several hours in duration (up to four hours). The patient then will reawaken and have lunch and then after a couple of hours of sustained wakefulness, will reinitiate sleep for an additional four hours of sleep.  Patient may sleep until 3:00 p.m. on certain given afternoons.  \n \nThe patient describes a history of prominent snoring symptomatology and suspected nocturnal respiratory pauses as well as \"restless\" sleep.  She denies a history of restless lower limb sensory complaints of nocturnal lower limb movements suggestive of periodic limb movement disorder.  She denies the history of abnormal arousal behaviors or associated narcoleptic symptoms.   \nPAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  \n1.   Seizure disorder.  \n2.   Hypertension.  \n3.   Borderline diabetes.  \n4.   Gastroesophageal reflux disease.  \n5.   Depressive disorder.  \n6.   Panic related symptoms.  \n \nSOCIAL HISTORY:  Patient denies active tobacco use.  She has discontinued all alcoholic beverage intake due to her reflux disease.  She averages two cups of tea per day.  While describing an overweight status, she has increased her weight by 10-20 pounds over the past four years.  \n \nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  On examination, the patient demonstrates a mildly hypersomnolent facies.  Speech is clear and fluent.  Receptive language functioning essentially intact.  No obvious cranial nerve deficits are appreciated.  No focal sensory motor neurologic deficits are noted.  No significant appendicular dystaxias or dysmetrias are currently in evidence. The routine gait appears to be normal based, without evidence of significant gait dystaxias.  No current clinical ictal manifestations are present.  No acute evidence of \"microsleeps\" are noted.   \nOn HEENT examination, there is evidence of a small posterior oropharyngeal apeture, with increased redundant tissue evident posteriorly and a mildly elongated uvula, as well as a high riding base of the tongue and mildly increased tonsillar size.   \nVital signs include a blood pressure of 144/88 (seated, left arm) and a heart rate of 88, with a respiratory rate of 14.   \nIMPRESSION:  \n1.   Hypersomnia (780.54):  Likely to be a result of frequent sleep disordered breathing events and their associated arousals.  Other diagnostic possibilities include the presence of gastroesophageal reflux associated arousals as well as nocturnal sleep disruptions due to sleep related epilepsy (although seizures appear to be under relatively good control on Tegretol anticonvulsant monotherapy).  \n2.   Obstructive sleep disordered breathing (780.53):  Patient describes a history of prominent snoring symptomatology and nocturnal respiratory pauses as well as extremely frequent intermittent obstructive apneas and a respiratory disturbance index of 26 per hour as noted during a recent 3/26/27 sleep study with associated O2 desaturations down to 76 percent.  Good clinical response to nocturnal CPAP therapy noted.  3.   Seizure disorder:  Recent literature suggests that there is a possible association between treatment of obstructive sleep disorder and increased seizure frequency in patients who are susceptible; i.e., thereby giving a further impetus for regular ongoing home CPAP therapy.  \n \nPLAN:  \n \n1.   Suggest regular home CPAP administration (CPAP Mallinckrodt; Respironics \"contour classic\" mask; ramp time of 20 minutes; warm air humidification; at 12 cm of water pressure).  \n \n2.   Pending clinical response, will reassess the patient's level of alertness, decrease amount of early morning awakenings, and possibly decrease seizure frequency at the next sleep study evaluation in 12-14 weeks times.  \n \n3.   In addition, patient is advised to continue efforts at weight reduction, use of an oro-dental, and/or potential ENT surgical approaches may also help to improve upper airway signs and symptoms.  \n \n4.   Patient to continue on Tegretol anticonvulsant monotherapy 200 mg tablets, four tablets po q.a.m. and three tablets po q.h.s. until an assessment of seizure frequency with nocturnal CPAP therapy has been made.  \n \n5.   Follow up neurologic reevaluation in our sleep study department is tentatively scheduled in 12-14 weeks time.   \nOnce again, thank you for allowing me to share in the medical care of Ms. Norma Mckee.  I hope this letter finds you in the best of health.  \n \nSincerely, \n \n \n \nSalvador B. Irvin, M.D.  \nDepartment of Sleep Studies \nHouston Medical Center \n \n \nADDENDUM:  Sleep study results (3/26/27):  \n1.   Extremely frequent intermittent obstructive (82) and partially obstructive apneas (63) during supine sleep, as well as intermittent hypopneas (19) and nocturnal hypoventilations, intermittent snore arousals (4) and episodes of moderate snoring (respiratory disturbance index = 26 per hour) with associated arousals and O2 desaturations down to 76%.  Insofar as stage REM sleep was not achieved, the actual degree of respiratory compromise may be under represented.  \n \n2.   CPAP administration (CPAP Mallinckrodt; Respironics \"contour classic\" mask; ramp time of 20 minutes; warm air humidification; at 12 cm of water pressure) served to considerably reduce the frequency of these nocturnal respiratory disturbances, help consolidate sleep, as well as improve O2 saturations (i.e., to 96% and above, even during REM supine sleep) and overall sleep stage architecture.  \n \n3.   Slightly increased periodic limb movements of sleep, activated during both \"light\" non-REM, as well as stage REM sleep (index = 8 per hour) with infrequent limb associated arousals (index = 1 per hour) both of which may serve to interfere with the continuity of sleep (the presence of REM related nocturnal lower limb movements may suggest some degree of REM motor disinhibition).  \n \n4.   Cardiac rates typically ranged between 72-87 beats per minute; average 80 beats per minute.  \n \n5.   EEG evidence of frequent bursts and brief runs of \"diffuse\" spike-wave discharges were evident during light sleep, without associated clinical accompaniment.  \n \n6.   Inability to achieve stage REM sleep under pre-CPAP conditions, but with prominent \"slow wave and REM rebounds\" subsequently noted with CPAP administration; i.e., accounting for more than 41% and more than 31% of the CPAP sleep times, respectively.  \n \n7.   Total recording period:  405 minutes; total sleep time:  377 minutes.  \n \n \n \nDD:05/18/2127 \nDT:05/20/2127 \nRS:91294     :1305\nRecord date: 2130-02-16\n\n\n\n\n\nINTERNAL MEDICINE ASSOCIATES\n\nHOUSTON MEDICAL CENTER\n\n\n\nPersonal data and overall health   This is a 54-year-old woman with hypertension, hyperlipidemia, glucose intolerance, depression, and agoraphobia.\n\n\n\nReason for visit   Extended interval visit.\n\n\n\nMajor Problems\n\nDepression\n\n/chronic mood disorder with elements of paranoia/(?) psychosis/agoraphobia.  Medicines reviewed.  She will follow up with Dr. Thurston.  She is largely homebound, fearful of her phone, fearful of going out, overeating, under exercising but not despondent or self-destructive.  She does have support from sister and brother who live at home with her. \n\nP:  Per Dr. Thurston.  Discussed the potential of transitional therapist if she relocates.\n\nFamily history risk factors\n\n/ cad;diabetes.  An episode of chest discomfort occurred at rest watching TV.  He had to get up and go to bed.  They were no episymptoms of sweat, nausea, vomiting, and dyspnea, but she did have both chest and left arm discomfort, the duration was an hour, this occurred a month ago.  She has been active since then around the house without pain and had no pain walking in today.  \n\nA:  Episode of chest discomfort with family history of CAD and multiple risk factors. \n\nP:  Check EKG.  She will call for recurrent symptoms.\n\nGlucose intolerance\n\n/family history of diabetes.  Lots of sugars and carbohydrates.  Weight is up. \n\nP:  Update hemoglobin A1c next month when she returns for fasting blood; urine microalbumin today; long overdue for an eye exam and she and her sister promised to schedule this.  Diet reviewed and weight program urged.\n\nHiatal hernia\n\nOnly occasional reflux and heartburn but one episode at the holiday rather vigorous reflux with a vomiting episode without chest pain.  There was vigorous vomiting and she actually experienced some blood.  She states \"one-half cup.\"  Stools were dark for several days thereafter, then cleared, now normal and she has had no satiety, dysphagia, or recurrent symptoms.  She has a well documented GERD and reflux, and HH on barium swallow in 2123.  She has not been having major breakthrough reflux on Prilosec 20 mg.  \n\nA:  Episode of reflux, vomiting possible esophageal tear with symptoms now abated and color looks good.  She does not appear markedly anemic.  There are no symptoms to suggest Barrett, but obviously this is a consideration. \n\nP:  Check CBC, stool guaiac for starters and iron level.  If she significantly anemic and these symptoms persist an EGD would be appropriate though he may have to negotiate this, given her agoraphobia.  Minimally, she will stay on Prilosec one or two a day in the meantime and call me if there is anymore vomiting, bleeding, or black stools.\n\nHypertension\n\nBlood pressure is okay.P:  Continue current treatment.     02/16/2130:\n\nMenstrual disorder\n\n/ status post hysterectomy, BSO for endometriomas, fibroids.  Ran out of Premarin three days ago, not terribly troubled by hot flashes. \n\nP:  Discontinue Premarin.  If hot flashes reoccur badly, we can go to 0.3 and then wean more slowly.  She will let me know.\n\nOverweight\n\nP:  Encouraged weight loss.     02/16/2130:\n\nSciatica\n\nNo recurrence.     02/16/2130:\n\nSeizure disorder\n\nWe will check Tegretol level, CBC, and LFTs.  She is overdue and had episode at the holidays of fainting like feeling without seizure prodrome or seizure activity. \n\nP:  Check levels.  Call for any further episodes.  Described episode was not clearly arrhythmic by her symptoms and she had no post ictal.  She will let me know if this occurs again and seek attention at that time.\n\nSleep apnea\n\nSister states she needs a new sleep device and we will take care of a referral on contact from her supplier.\n\nGallstones\n\n/ status post cholecystectomy at time of hysterectomy.  The episode of abdominal discomfort and vomiting was not clearly colic and she is post hysterectomy, but might have a recurrent stone.  No obvious icterus today. \n\nP:  LFT profile.  Call for further difficulties.\n\nChest pain\n\nCT as above. \n\nP:  Check EKG.\n\n\n\nActive Medications\n\n Tegretol 200mg po 7 TABLETS PER DAY\n\n potassium chloride 20meq po QD\n\n hydrochlorothiazide 12.5 mg po qd\n\n tetracycline 500mg po QD\n\n lisinopril 30 mg po qd\n\n Prilosec 20mg po QD\n\n Celexa 20 mg 2 po qd\n\n Klonopin 0.5mg po 1/2 qd\n\n Remeron 15 mg  po 2tabs qd\n\n Seroquel 25 mg  po 2tabs bid and 4 ab qhs\n\n Flexeril 10 mg po tid PRN muscle spasm\n\n Lipitor 10mg po qd\n\n\n\nChange in therapies and Renewals\n\nTegretol 200mg po 7 TABLETS PER DAY QTY:350 Refills:nr Start: 4/12/20\n\npotassium chloride 20meq po QD QTY:90 Refills:3 Start: 8/2/20\n\nhydrochlorothiazide 12.5 mg po qd QTY:90 Refills:3 Start: 10/16/23\n\ntetracycline 500mg po QD QTY:90 Refills:3 Start: 9/11/21\n\nlisinopril 30 mg po qd QTY:90 Refills:3 Start: 5/22/23\n\nPrilosec 20mg po QD QTY:90 Refills:3 Start: 9/18/23\n\nCelexa 20 mg  2 po qd Start: 11/2/24\n\nKlonopin 0.5mg po 1/2 qd Start: 10/18/2125\n\nPremarin 0.625mg po QD QTY:90 Refills:3 Start: 10/18/2125 End: 2/16/2130 - Inactivated\n\nSeroquel 25 mg  po 2tabs bid and 4 ab qhs Start: 8/13/2127\n\nLipitor 10mg po qd QTY:90 Refills:3 Start: 11/30/2129\n\n\n\nProcedures\n\nInfluenza vaccine STATUS POST left arm, lot# N2453KM, Aventis.\n\n\n\nFamily history   Negative in the interval.\n\n\n\nSocial history   See detail above.

As you recall he is a 71-year-old gentleman who is\nstatus post angioplasty on the left for high-grade stenotic\nlesions of the distal superficial femoral artery and the\npopliteal artery on the left.  The patient presents now for\nfurther evaluation of his \"claudication symptoms\".\n\nThe patient states he has bilateral lower extremity symptoms,\nthere are about equivalent in nature.  He has very minimal low\nback pain.  He states it seems to be getting worse and seems to\nbe associated with some abnormal gait.  He states on a bad day\nits about a 9/10 and even on a good day sometimes it can be as\nhigh as 8-9/10.  The episodes are almost daily and are brought on\nby things like walking.  He can walk less than one block at which\npoint he has lateral calf burning and at times notes some slow\nshuffling and occasionally falling.  When he is having severe\nsymptoms he notes his legs to be weak.  He denies any bowel or\nbladder abnormalities of late, but has a historic of a chronic\nUTI secondary to his benign prostatic hypertrophy.  He has very\nlittle back pain associated with his symptomatology.  He has had\nno physical therapy to date and no spinal injections.  He\ndescribes his general health as poor, but when specially asked he\nstates it is because he his 71 and has a history of hypertension.\n Years ago he stated he was in excellent health.  His weight is\nsteady at 200 with no significant weight gain or loss.  He\ndoesn't smoke and drinks socially.  Quit smoking 33 years ago. \nHe does not think he will ever be pain free.\n\nReview of Systems:  Reveals that he is a diet controlled diabetic\nand he has been for the past couple of years.  He has difficulty\nwith sleep.  He has a balance problem and also has benign\nprostatic hypertrophy leading to chronic urinary tract infection,\nfor this he takes Cardura.  He has a history of high blood\npressure.  Denies any other cardiovascular abnormality.  No\nrespiratory malfunction.  He has had surgery for something \"in\nhis colon\" he has also had a bypass surgery.  He is on Plavix and\naspirin.\n\nPhysical Examination:  Shows that he is solid built, healthy\nappearing male.  He is able to toe and heel walk but on the left\nside his T band seems to be slightly weak.  Single toe raises\nshow that the right leg is stronger than the left leg.  He has no\ntenderness to his PSIS and he has no Waddell signs.  He has\nnegative Trendelenburg bilaterally.  Forward flexion allows him\nto get to the patella.  Extension is pain free and passive\nhyperextension does not reproduce the symptoms.\n\nMotor testing is normal in his lower extremities.  Sensory is\nsymmetric.  He has negative straight leg raises.  He has no\npalpable pulses.  He is hairless in his lower extremities.  He\nhad no clonus or Babinski and a negative Hoffman's suggesting\nthat he is not myelopathic despite his \"balance abnormality\".\n\nHe is on multiple meds for his hypertension, for his diabetes,\nand for his gastroesophageal reflux.\n\nPersonal review of his plain films and a CAT scan indicating\nwith, show decent residual lumbar lordosis with a stent noted in\nhis iliac artery on the right.  CT scan shows lumbosacral facet\nhypertrophy.\n\nAt this point, impression is of spinal stenosis and degenerative\ndisk disease.  I have asked him to obtain an MRI and return to\nsee me after that.\n\nThanks for the referral.\n\n\n\n\n\n______________________________\nStephen Nichols, M.D.\n\n\nDictated By: Stephen Nichols\n\n\neScription document:6-0190274 EFFocus\n\n\n\nDD: 11/14/54\nDT: 11/14/54\nDV: 11/14/54\nRecord date: 2155-07-11\n\n\n\nJuly 11, 2155\n\n\n\nName:\tOlive, Xavier\t\t\n\nMRN: 26690002\n\n\n\nMr. Olive was seen with Dr. Innis in general neurology clinic on 07/11/55.   Dr. Innis was present for or performed all salient aspects of the history and physical exam and together we discussed with the patient the work-up and treatment plan. \n\n\n\nReturn visit.\n\nMr. Olive is a 71y old RHM, with Idiopathic Parkinson's disease. He was started on Sinemet 25/100mg tid with significant improvement in his balance & gait & rest tremor. However there were still periods of shuffling & stumbling especially going down slope. He also complained of persistant fatigue in his legs. We started him on Amantadine 100mg tid during his last visit. He did not tolerate it well & complained of dizziness especially when he goes out, even with reduced dose of 100mg bid.

His referring physician is Dr.  Ximena Keane, practicing out of Alexandria Clinic.  Mr.  Olive also heard about the TMH VC through TV advertisements.  \n\n\n\nHe is 73 years old, has history of diabetes starting in 2135, known history of peripheral artery disease with claudication and calf discomfort, for which he has previously seen Dr.  Cain at Alexandria Clinic, and also has been evaluated and treated at the Corcoran District Hospital.  Specifically, he describes having been evaluated by Dr.  Cain and others some three or four years ago, and undergoing at least two procedures, all related to his legs cramping up.  He received prior stenting to his right common iliac artery and his left superficial femoral artery, so far as I can tell.  The stents were placed at Pomeroy Care Center (Big Rapids, AC) and also he had evaluation at the Corcoran District Hospital, and may have had a stenting procedure or revascularization procedure there.  The patient and his wife are somewhat unclear about the dates and locations and times, but he does state that the treatments apparently did not help him at all.  Currently, he has discomfort in both calves when he walks too far or too fast, and this stops him at about 50 yards.  \n\n\n\nThe issue was complicated by the fact that he has had progressive parkinsonian-type symptoms, walking in a shuffle, tipping forward, and occasionally even falling forward and losing his balance completely.  His legs are rubbery, and he does even realize that he is falling forward when it happens.  It is worse when he is carrying things that weigh anything.  At the same time, his calves do cramp up in a typical fashion consistent with claudication, and he has known peripheral artery disease.  Also feels though his hips sometimes are cramping up.  The patient feels quite disabled by his symptoms, especially as a gentleman who was active and never had physical problems of this nature.  Again, there is some degree of blurring between the parkinsonian symptoms and his claudication, as to which is truly causing his disability.\n\n\n\n\t\t\tPast medical history:\n\n   Diabetes, onset in 2135.  \n\nParkinsonian-type movement disorder, followed by Dr.  Jeffers and Innis, and for which he was placed on Sinemet, presuming it was due to Parkinson's.  The patient has not improved despite trying the medications.  MRI at AC starting in 2153 has shown apparent central and peripheral atrophy, unchanged.  \n\nStatus post vertebrobasilar TIA by report.  \n\nNeuropathy, documented by EMG in 2151 with no spinal stenosis by MRI.  \n\nCervical spondylosis.  \n\nTracheal tumor resection in 2128 performed via a suprasternal incision.  \n\nHypertension.  \n\nMild renal artery stenosis documented by arteriography in 2153 during one of his peripheral angiograms.\n\n\n\nCurrent Medications:\n\n  lisinopril 2.5 mg QD\n\n glyburide 2.5 mg QD\n\n cilostazol 100 mg BID\n\n terazosin 4 mg QD\n\n Sinemet 25/100 mg 2 tabs TID\n\n aspirin 325 mg QD\n\n pyridoxine 50 mg QD\n\n atenolol 25 mg QD\n\n folic acid 1 mg QD\n\n gabapentin 100 mg BID\n\n metformin hydrochloride 850 mg TID\n\n ranitidine HCl 150 mg QHS\n\n Zocor 10 mg QHS\n\n Plavix; Dir: Stopped because of ecchymosis and epistaxis -stop\n\n\n\nAllergies:\n\n\t\t\t\n\nNo known allergies   \n\n\n\n\t\t\tFamily history:\n\n   Noncontributory.  No coronary artery disease or MI.\n\n\n\n\t\t\tSocial history:\n\n   He is retried Motor Vehicle Body Repairer.  He used to work at GM.  He lives with his wife, who comes in today with him.  He has three children.  Nondrinker.  He smoked until 30 years ago.\n\n\n\n\t\t\tReview of systems:\n\n   Detailed review of systems was carried out.  It was also reviewed on the patient questionnaire sheet that the patient brought with him.  He does claim to have some dyspnea with exertion as well as intermittent indigestion consistent with GERD.  He has nocturia.  He wears dentures.  No significant weight loss or anorexia.  No visual changes or other neurologic symptoms other than the gait disturbance and neuropathy.  He denies chest discomfort or anything to suggest cardiac ischemia.  Otherwise, review of systems is negative in detail.\n\n\n\nPhysical examination:\n\n\t\t\t\n\n-Pulse:   68 and regular.  Afebrile\n\n-BP: 105/55    , obtained by myself.  Equal bilaterally\n\n-General:   Well-developed male in no distress, appears his stated age.  Slightly stooped over, and has a parkinsonian-type affect and appearance\n\n-Skin:   Without rashes\n\n-Heent:   Normal facies, or slightly masked, with normal extraocular motions and reactive pupils\n\n-Neck:   Carotid upstrokes are normal, no bruits.  No JVD\n\n-Chest:   Clear\n\n-Cardiac:   Discloses normal S1 and S2, no S3 or S4, and no murmurs\n\n-Abdomen:   Moderately obese, protuberant, soft, and nontender.  Good bowel sounds, no organomegaly, no enlargement of the aorta.  May be a soft bruit in the midline to deep auscultation\n\n-Extremities:   Femoral pulses are 2+ bilaterally, with soft bruits on both sides.  Below this, no cyanosis or edema (perhaps trace to 1+ edema), and posterior tibial pulses are 1 to 2+.  Dorsalis pedis pulses are not easily palpable.  Good capillary refill\n\n-Neuro:   Gait is disturbed, with slight shuffling and slightly stooped.  His strength is normal, and sensory findings are slightly abnormal with diminished sensation in a stocking-glove distribution.  He does not have any cogwheeling to my examination.  Otherwise, no focal deficits\n\n\n\nProcedures:\n\n\t\t\t\n\nFree text procedures  Exercise ABIs-resting ABI is normal on the right and left at 0.  92 and 1.03, respectively.  The toe brachial index drops to 0.29 on the right side and 0.91 at 1 minute after exercise.  I am not sure what to make of these ABIs since it appears that the actual ankle-brachial indices were not measured following exercise.\n\n\n\n\t\t\tEKG:\n\n    demonstrates normal sinus rhythm or sinus bradycardia at heart rate of 55.  There is normal axis and intervals, with no evidence of prior infraction, and perhaps a slight right ventricular conduction delay.\n\n\n\n\t\t\tOther Data:\n\n   DOB: 11/25/2083.\n\n\n\n\t\t\tAssessment and plan:\n\n   Lower extremity arterial disease (PAD)-the patient clearly has history of PAD with prior interventions on both sides.  Currently, complains of symptoms that sound like claudication, predominantly involving the calves on both sides, right slightly ahead of the left, and I would not be surprised if he has significant focal obstructive disease along the length of his iliac of SFA.  Since his ABIs are well preserved at rest, I suspect he does not have pre-occlusion of the SFA, for example.  On the other hand, he does have diabetes and his ABIs may be falsely elevated.  \n\n\n\nHis major limitation is due to a combination of the claudication that occurs less than 50 yards and stops him at that point, and the gait disturbance that he has related to his movement disorder, possible Parkinson's disease.  I am not sure that this latter entity has been well enough defined, and I would suggest that we have him see a neurologist here to better ascertain the nature of that disease, and as to whether there is anything better available in the way of treatment.  \n\n\n\n1.  As far his peripheral artery disease, it would be extremely helpful to obtain films from AC and/or the CDH, to better define what procedures were actually performed and where stents were placed.  Given that it has been a year or more since his last intervention, it is likely he will need another angiographic study (or MRA/CTA) in order to ascertain the nature of his disease.  \n\n\n\n2.  Neurologic disorder-we will refer to a neurologist.  \n\n\n\nPLAN: \n\n1.  Formal exercise ABIs.  \n\n2.  Obtain angiographic studies from AC.  \n\n3.  Followup visit in one month.  \n\n4.

In 7/77, he had been treated at NAMG for a left lower lobe PNA with levofloxacin, and developed diarrhea while in the hospital.  After discharge, he continued to have profuse diarrhea, and was treated with IV hydration and metronidazole C. diff infection, first found to be positive on 7/31/77.  Since then he has had multiple episodes of recurrent C. diff.   Most recently, he was admitted to NAMG for treatment of recurrent C. diff in 1/77, with improvement after receiving inpatient vancomycin and flagyl, and discharged to NAMG, where he was for 3 weeks.  He received 21 days of flagyl.  After about two weeks, he noticed a gradual increase in his stool frequency.  Three weeks prior to admission, he began taking 500 mg PO Flagyl q8h, which he had at home.  He felt that his symptoms were improved somewhat on the flagyl.  One week ago, he saw his PCP, where a C. diff stool toxin was negative.   At that point, he stopped the PO flagyl, and shortly afterward his diarrhea again progressively worsened.  Currently he is having 10 BM per day, and he states that they are similar to odor, color, and frequency to his prior C. diff episodes.  He has also had a few days of lower abdominal pain, 2-3/10, with no clear pattern, and noticed a few flecks of blood in his stool 2 days ago on one occasion.   He denies other symptoms including fever/chills, n/v, cp, sob, and dizziness. He reports that when he had taken PO vancomycin in the past, it cost $40 per tablet.\n\n\nED:  Afebrile, HR 70s.

Quick\n\nATCH: \t\t655-75-45\n\n\n\nDear Harry and Yair:\n\n\n\nMy thanks for your kind referral of the above noted patient with respect to her disabling claudication and of course she is not in a very happy circumstance.  As you know, she is just 52 years of age.  Her cardiovascular risk factors include type 2 diabetes treated with metformin and Glyburide, hypertension, hyperlipidemia and she is a former cigarette smoker but she has not smoked in a year.  She spends a lot of time caring for her partially disabled husband.  She has known and impressive history of peripheral vascular disease.  She has undergone bilateral leg revascularizations.  On the left side initially an iliac stent was tried but in January of 2063 she had a left iliofemoral endarterectomy with angioplasty and in situ above knee left fem-pop bypass graft.  This reconstruction is functioning well, as evidenced by pulse examination and she certainly does not have any major symptoms in the left side.  In April of 2063 she had a right common femoral and external iliac endarterectomy with a right fem-pop bypass graft to the above-knee popliteal artery using transposed greater saphenous veins.  There had previously been a right iliac PTA and stent.  She states that the procedure in the right leg was only transiently of benefit.  By last spring, i.e. a year ago she again had rather limiting claudication.  She says this is now worse over the past several months and she quantifies this as severe calf pain after just a couple of blocks.  Importantly she does not have ischemic rest pain and she has never had tissue loss.  Recently resting ABIs were recorded at 0.46 on the right and 0.8 on the left.  Her continued complaints led to a repeat arteriogram last October documenting a superficial femoral artery occlusion (??? length thereof - she did not bring the films themselves) and a patent albeit small reconstituted above-knee popliteal artery with decent runoff.  Understandably Dr. Adcock was reluctant about recommending further revascularizations.  She has sought an opinion here in this regard.  She has no known coronary artery disease and her general system review is notable for a prior hospitalization in 2061 for severe pancreatitis requiring laparotomy.  On physical examination blood pressure was 140/80.  Pulse was 70 and regular.  Carotid upstroke was normal and there were no major carotid bruits.  She has femoral pulses on both sides and the left fem-pop bypass graft in situ is palpable, as is the left popliteal pulse.  There is no right popliteal nor right foot pulse.  She does have dependent rubor on that right side although there is no tissue breakdown.\n\n\n\nThis is of course a very unhappy situation.  Further attempts at surgical revascularization in the setting of having both greater saphenous veins harvested and so forth is really not justified for claudication alone since the result can be anticipated to be not very good.  However I am not absolutely ruling this out.  I would suggest the following.  Her risk factor control is decent and she should certainly stay on the Lipitor, aspirin and Plavix.  Since her problem is claudication I would like Yair to institute Pletal at full dosages and give this at least a couple of months before we can say that she has had an adequate trial with question benefit.  She will get the actual arteriogram from the October study to me.  If it seems reasonable and the right superficial femoral artery block is not too long an attempt at percutaneous recanalization could be considered.  I will get back to you after review of the films themselves.  My thanks once again.  With every best wish.\n\n\n\nSincerely,\n\n\n\n\n\nDaniel W. Iniguez, M.D.\n\n\n\ncc:\tYair K.

Over the past month, however, the patient reports that she has had progressive pain in her R foot and leg, which wakes her up from sleep almost every night.  She can walk less than one block without disabling claudication which improves with rest.  She also has noticed discoloration of her R foot, along with numbness and paresthesias, which have been progressive over the same time period.  \n\n\n\nShe denies all symptoms other than RLE pain and claudication as described.  Specifically, she denies chest pain, shortness of breath, dizziness, headache, and fevers/chills.  She reports that her left leg is occasionally painful, although it has been tolerable in comparison to her R leg.  She has been taking aspirin and plavix regularly, but has not taken coumadin for 2 days (last dose 7/31/65).  \n\n\n\nShe last underwent arterial LENIs on 7/17/65, which demonstrated critical ischemia in her R leg and a thrombosed R fem-pop BPG (see below for official report).  She is admitted for elective revascularization of her R leg.  \n\n\n\nPMH:  \n\nDM II\n\nHTN\n\nPVD\n\nHyperlipidemia\n\nChronic Pancreatitis\n\n\n\nPSH: \n\n9/20/64: angio/PTA L proximal fem-pop bpg and L SFA\n\n9/17/64: R CFA endarterectomy; R fem-BK pop BPG w/ propatent graft\n\n10/2063, angio w/ BLE runoff\n\n4/2063: R CFA and EIA endarterectomy; R fem-pop BPG to AK pop using transposed greater saphenous veins\n\n1/2063: L iliofemoral endarterectomy with PTA &amp; in situ vein AK L fem-pop bpg\n\n2061: Whipple procedure for chronic pancreatitis\n\n\n\nMeds: \n\n  1.

Ate frequently but watched portions.  Apparently patient checks blood sugars between 3:00 and 3:00 and when she has shakiness.  She was under the impression that after lunch she had to fast for three hours prior to checking sugar, at which point notes low blood sugars in the 50's to 70's with shakiness, for which she takes a handful of raisins.  Generally eats breakfast at 8:30, lunch 12:00 or 12:30, supper at 5:30.  Snacks in the evening, always apple and yogurt.  Most recently, additionally popcorn and saltine crackers, occasional pretzels.  After takes raisins, shakiness of hypoglycemic symptoms resolve.  While on cruise, patient found that she could actually walk more than she thought she could.  Since she has been home, has not been walking routinely.\n\n(2)\tHTN: No chest pain, shortness of breath or palpitations.  \n\n(3)\tBack pain/lower extremity pain.  States taking glucosamine chondroitin.  Over the last two or three months, feels that it is helping with decreased pain.  Also has been seen at physical therapy again.  Feels that this is helping.\n\n\n\nPE:\tWeight down 2 pounds!.  Blood pressure, right arm: 126/68.  Chest is clear.  Cardiac: Regular rhythm at 66, no murmur or gallop.  \n\n\n\nA/P:\t(1)\tDiabetes mellitus: Somewhat better control with mildly elevated morning sugars.  Have asked patient to decrease popcorn and/or crackers at h.s.  Have advised patient to take small handful of raisins prior to onset of hypoglycemic symptoms advised around 2:00 to 2:30 p.m.  Have encouraged patient to continue to walk daily.  Continue current treatment.\n\n(2)\tBack pain/lower extremity pain: Some improvement with PT and increased med.  Continue for now.\n\n(3)\tHTN: At goal.  Return to clinic at the beginning of November to Dr. Ullom to resume care.\n\nKathleen L Kuhn, RNC, ANP\n\nKL/utz/orton\nRecord date: 2063-12-13\n\n\n\n\nNAME:     Umphrey, Tammy \nMRN:       0942207\n\nThe patient is here as a walk-in.  Her spouse is present.\n\nPatient says she is status post a fall this past Monday at home.  Says that she seems\nto have lost her balance while opening a door at home.  Denies prodromal\nsymptoms including shortness of breath, dizziness, or palpitations.  There was no\nloss of consciousness.  Patient was seen in the emergency room that day for trauma\nto the head.  Had a negative CT of her head and had an x-ray of her pelvis, as she\ncomplained of some hip pain.  Both studies were negative.  Patient was then sent\nhome with Roxicet.  Patient was seen in the walk-in clinic at CPI yesterday, after\nnoticing a swollen tongue and some difficulty swallowing.  Patient was immediately\ntold to stop both her Roxicet and Monopril and was treated for angioedema with\nZantac and Claritin.  Today patient has no further throat tightness or tongue\nswelling.  She is, however, uncomfortable continuing the Effexor for unclear\nreasons and wants to stop it.\n\nPatient is also complaining of severe low back pain, which she says has persisted\nsince her fall on Monday.  Did not have an x-ray of the area.  Says it is very painful\nto sit.  Roxicet was not helping.  She is off her Ultram as well.\n\nPHYSICAL EXAM:  WD/overweight female in NAD.  Vital signs as per LMR,\nWNL.  Weight 213 pounds. \n\nLungs - clear bilateral breath sounds.  Cor - RRR, S1, S2, without murmur or S3\nnoted.  Back - slightly bent gait.  Tenderness over lower sacrum.  No asymmetry or\nobvious deformity.  \n\nX-ray of sacrum 12/13/63 - could not see fracture as per my reading.\n\nASSESSMENT AND PLAN:  \n\n(1)  Angioedema.  Agree that most likely culprits are Roxicet since it was started\n     only two days ago, and ACE inhibitors which have been associated with\n     angioedema.  Currently on Lopressor and Dyazide, patient's blood pressure\n     is WNL.  So will follow for now.\n\n(2)  Low back pain.  Reviewed the possibility of a coccygeal fracture for which\n     treatment would not be any different than pain management and a donut\n     pillow.  Patient was given a prescription for the pillow.  She was told to look\n     out for signs of nerve compression and to go to the ER if she experienced\n     any perianal numbness or incontinence.  Will notify patient by phone if x-ray\n     shows a fracture. \n\n(3)  Depression.  Did not feel I was able to speak freely in front of the patient's\n     spouse.  Had been put on the Effexor by Dr. Zeman.  Advised patient to let\n     her psychiatrist know that we are tapering her off of the Effexor.  Will take\n     25 mg q.o.d. for the next week.  \n\n(4)  Pain control.  Will switch from Vicodin to Vicodin ES 1 q. 6 as needed. \n     Knows to go to ER if experiences any symptoms consistent with angioedema.\n\nReturn to clinic in approximately one month.\n\n\n\nSusan Ullom, M.D.\n\nSU/utz/rankin\nRecord date: 2064-08-28\n\nPatient Name: UMPHREY, FRANKIE;  MRN: 0942207\nDictated on: 08/28/2064 by WHITNEY EASTERLING, M.D. \n\n \nCHIEF COMPLAINT:  Falling and low back pain.  \n \nHISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 66 year old, right-handed female whose past medical history is significant for status post laminectomy at L3 to L5 in January of 2061.  The patient was in her usual state of health with some residual weakness from the stenosis and occasional buckling of her knees without loss of consciousness until 12/01 when she fell backwards.  There was no obvious leg buckling.  She said she just came off balance without loss of consciousness or dizziness or preceding lightheadedness.  Since then she has had several falls always when she is moving.   \nMEDICATIONS:  Her medications have included in the past Motrin 800 t.i.d. without significant effect on her low back pain.  Ultram q.i.d. was beneficial.  Neurontin 300 q.i.d. which was also beneficial without side effect and chondroitin sulfate which she feels has been very helpful without side effect.   \nREVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  She has bilateral dysesthesias, left sciatica to her ankle.  She has had weight loss without fevers, chills or night sweat.  She has had no retinopathy and she has a history of reflux and otherwise her cardiovascular, pulmonary, GI/GU and musculoskeletal review of systems are unremarkable.   \nPAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Spinal stenosis with a laminectomy at L3, 4 and 5 in January of 2061.  She has had left knee arthroscopy.  She had mild spinal stenosis at T12 to L1, severe at L3/4 and 4/5 with bilateral foraminal disease.  She has had a ten year history of diabetes.  She has hypertension and hypothyroidism.   \nMEDICATIONS:  Synthroid, Premarin, glynase, glucophage, metoprolol and Effexor.  \n \nALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.  \n \nSOCIAL HISTORY:  She is married.  No history of tobacco or alcohol.  \n \nFAMILY HISTORY:  Positive for coronary artery disease, breast cancer and diabetes.  \n \nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  She is a well-appearing, well-nourished, 66 year old female.  Her mental state examination is normal.  Cranial nerves II through XII are intact.  Motor strength is significant for full strength in the upper extremities as well as the lower extremities.  Sensation is intact to all modalities with bilateral lower extremity dysesthesia reported subjectively.  DTR's are symmetric with downgoing toes bilaterally.  Coordination is intact with no axial or appendicular ataxia.   \nASSESSMENT AND PLAN:  This is a 66 year old right-handed female with history of spinal stenosis status post decompression who has a history of falls.  We will obtain an MRI of her lumbosacral to evaluate that area for any recurrent pathology or new changes.  For her radicular pain will increase her Neurontin 400 q.i.d.  We would like to obtain EMG with nerve conduction studies of the lower extremities to evaluate possible need for reoperation.  The patient will return to clinic after these studies.  The patient was seen and evaluated and management was discussed with the attending.  \n \n \n_______________________________ \nWhitney Easterling, M.D.  \n \n \n \nDD:08/28/2064 \nDT:08/29/2064 \nDT:2617      :6415\nRecord date: 2066-08-27\n\n      Team A Intern Admit Note\n\nPatient Name: Tammy Umphrey\n\nMR#  0942207\n\nDate of Admission:  8/26/66\n\nAttending: Yoel Pollard\n\nPCP:  Susan Ullom\n\n\n\nCC/ID:  70 yo woman with significant disability following cerebral aneurysm rupture 1/ 66, admitted with likely UTI and question of altered mental status\n\n\n\nHPI:  (As summarized from ED admit note and computer notes, pt is not able to give history and family is not present.)  Ms. Umphrey is somewhat cognitively and expressively impaired following rupture of a cerebral aneurysm 1/ 66; she was required sub-occipital craniotomy, clot evacuation, and placement for a VP shunt.  She was transferred to Kingsley County Clinic 2/66, and was d/c'd 5/31/66. Discharge summary indicates that her baseline at that time included being able to follow 1 step commands part of the time and some attempts at communication.  She gets nutrition and medication through a G-tube at this point, and has had an indwelling foley catheter.\n\n\tComputer notes suggest that prior to August 5, the indwelling foley catheter had been removed. However, the patient's constant incontinence and difficulty keeping a decubitus ulcer dry, the notes suggest that the foley was replaced 8/5/66.  8/09/66 Ms. Umphrey was taken to the emergency room; the symptoms she was having at that time are not clear. U/A was suggestive of a UTI, and she was treated with a 3-day course of levofloxacin. There is no record of her foley catheter being changed at that time, and urine cultures were not sent.  Telephone notes from 8/23 suggest that Ms. Umphrey had yeast infection and foley blockage;  8/25 the VNA checked a U/A at home; results were consistent with a UTI.  Her husband reports that she has also been more somnolent and    less herself    over the last few days. She was sent to the PDI ED for further evaluation.\n\n\tIn the ED, repeat U/A was consistent with UTI; urine culture grew abundant staph aureus. She was given a dose of levofloxacin 500mg and transferred to the floor.\n\n\n\nPMH: (Per chart- pt unable to provide history)\n\n1.

Patchy low attenuation areas in the centrum semiovale\n\n\tbilaterally which are more prominent now and most likely are due\n\n\tto chronic microangiopathic changes in this agroup.\n\n\n\nEKG:\tNormal sinus rhythm, normal axis, normal intervals. Flattened T-waves, but not changed from prior exam. No evidence of acute ischemia.\n\n\n\nImpression:  70 yo woman with compromised baseline neurologic function, admitted with complicated UTI and possible change in mental status.\n\n\n\nMental status changes: given likely undertreated UTI 8/09/66, pt likely has recurrent complicated UTI and may have some mental status alterations from this source. Important to rule out VP-shunt complication as cause of mental status chage, but CT appears unchanged from 4/66. Hyponatremia may also be contributing somewhat  to mental status changes.\n\n-will treat UTI and pursue possibility of urosepsis with blood cultures\n\n-will check TSH and am cortisol which could also contribute to mental status changes, particularly given pts history of hypothyroidism\n\nUTI\n\n-likely UTI- tx\n\n-will send blood cultures to assess for sepsis from urinary source\n\n-unclear if staph aureus is true urinary pathogen, but will treat with vancomycin until sensitivities come back, then treat with appropriate antibiotic\n\n-treat with levoquin for complicated UTI while awaiting final microbiology data\n\n-change foley now\n\n-resend u/a and culture after 1-2 days of antibiotics\n\nHyponatremia- may be contributing to any change in mental status\n\n-volume status very difficult to assess- if hypovolemic, likely hypovolemic hyponatremia.

The information available today is limited to his knowledge of the events.\n\n\n\nHe is an 67-year-old Honduran man with a history of diabetes mellitus and HTN.  In August he suffered a stroke.  He reports that his speech was affected and that he developed severe right arm and leg weakness without sensory loss.  He recalls no problem with his vision.  He was hospitalized at Dubuque Obstetrics Gynocology Center.  He does no know the extent of the evaluation.  He was discharged on aspirin to Mitchell County Hospital.  He is now living at home with his wife and son with visiting nurse assistance.  His primary care physician is at Flagler Hospital.  He has severe residual weakness of the right arm and leg.  He also complains of dizziness and an abnormal numbness in his mouth.  The dizziness is worst in the morning.  He also notices a noise in his head when he sleeps.\n\n\n\nHe has DM and HTN.  He is a nonsmoker.  I don't have cholesterol information.  There is no history of cardiac disease.  There is no history of alcohol abuse.\n\n\n\nHe is currently taking aspirin, insulin, antihypertensive medication of some type and possibly a cholesterol lowering agent, although he is no sure of this.  He has no known allergies.\n\n\n\nHe is aware of no significant family history.\n\n\n\nHe is married.  He lives with his wife and 22-year-old son.  He came to america from Honduras in 2073.  He worked nights in construction until his stroke.\n\n\n\nPulse 66, regular.  BP 186/110.  There are no cranial bruits.  The carotid pulses are full with no bruits.  The lungs are clear.  The heart is regular with no murmur.  The abdomen is benign.  The mental state is normal; he speaks Spanish and broken English.  He is able to name, repeat, and comprehend well.  His fluency in his native language is probably normal.  Cranial nerves are intact.  There is severe weakness of the right arm and leg: right interossei and finger flexors 1/5, finger extensors 0/5, biceps 1/5, triceps 0-1/5, deltoid 0-1/5.  (He tries to raise his arm proximally by elevating the shoulder.)  Right iliopsoas 2/5, quadriceps 2/5, hamstrings 1/5, distally 0/5.  The tone is only mildly increased.  Sensation is intact.  Reflexes are slghtly brisker in the right upper extremity (RUE 2+/4, LUE 2/4, knees 2+/4, ankles 2/4).  The right plantar response is mute; he withdraws the left.  Coordination is intact; weakness inhibits adequate testing on the right.  He wears a right AFO.  He can stand up from his wheelchair and bear weight maneuvering himself to the examining table, but he cannot walk unsupported.\n\n\n\nHis examination is most consistent with a right equal arm and leg pure motor hemiparesis, sparing the face.  This was likely due to a lacunar infarction in the left basis pontis from small vessel occlusion.  He has major stroke risk factors, including DM, HTN, and probably hypercholesterolemia.  Currently his major needs are to establish good control of his blood pressure and to control other risk factors, including optimtal glucose control and likely medication for hyperlipidemia, and to continue physical and occupational therapy to maximize his functional status.\n\n\n\nTo review the studies that were done to investigate his stroke in August, I will request the record of that hospitalization from DOGC.  I will also request his records from his physician at the Flagler Hospital.  He will certainly need an adjustment of his antihypertensive regimen.  He tells me that he is planning to see his PCP for this purpose.  I asked him to return here in a month to review this.\n\n\n\n\n\nSincerely,\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPatrick Winn, M.D.\nRecord date: 2092-05-24\n\n\n\n\nBAYONNE MEDICAL CENTER\nInternal Medicine\n15 Hassell Brook Road\nDaytona Highridge Estates, AZ  39757\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tNancy-Jasmine, Nikkolas \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t69331181\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t05/24/92 \n\n\nThe patient is a 67-year-old man with hypertension, diabetes, and \nhistory of recent stroke who comes in for follow up and for \nevaluation of positive PPD.\n\nHISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  He was being evaluated for day \nprogram and in the course of this had a PPD placed which was \npositive.

He went to Honduras approximately 3 months ago, and ran out of many of his medications in the last 2 weeks, including plavix, lopressor, and metformin. He self-d/c'd zestril for new nausea that he felt was related. Since symptom onset 7 days ago, patient has noted slow improvement in both dysarthria and dysphagia. He continues to note vertigo present sitting, worse standing, and absent supine. He has had difficulty ambulating as well, despite the use of his tripod cane, and his children have helped him at home. He returned from Honduras 3 days ago to refill his medications and get his symptoms evaluated. ROS notable for poor vision bilaterally, worse on the L per patient.

She\npresented to the Emergency Room 5.5 hours after last seeming\nnormal.  Her initial NI stroke scale was 11.  She was admitted to\nthe Neurology Service for a stroke workup.  Her imaging studies\nshowed a left MCA infarct involving the left corona radiata, head\nof the caudate basal ganglia, and an MI cutoff on the CTA and MRA\nin addition to a left ICA occlusion.  She was taken to angiogram\nfor interventional neuroradiology.  She had an angiogram. \nRadiology felt they were unable to access the\ncause and no intervention was attempted and the patient was\nadmitted to the Neuro ICU for blood pressure monitoring and\nhypertensive therapy.  She remained stable anti-coagulated on\nheparin.  During the hospital stay, she spontaneously converted\nto rapid ventricular rate atrial fibrillation, which was felt to\nbe the likely source of her stroke and as such was planned to\nremain anti-coagulated.  She was discharged to rehab and\nsubsequently went home from rehab on 08/04/2067.  At home, she\nhad been noted to have elevations in blood pressure but has been\nfeeling O.K.  VNA sees her once a week.  At rehab, for unclear\nreasons, her warfarin was discontinued and in speaking to the\ndischarging physician from the Tracy Medical Clinic, this was\ndone for a question of vaginal bleeding although the patient is\nunaware of any such problems.  She continues to get PT and\noccupational therapy twice per week and complains that her memory\nremains poor.  According to the family member and her daughter\nwho are here interpreting for her at Clinic today, she continues\nto have right-sided weakness, although significantly improved and\ndecreased verbal output although her daughter seemed to be able\nto communicate well with her.  Since her discharge, she has not\nhad any new episodes of numbness, weakness, headaches, or visual\nchanges.\n\nREVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  She denies any fevers, chills, weight loss,\nchest pain, shortness of breath, palpitations, leg cramps,\nclaudication, dyspnea on exertion, cough, wheezing, hemoptysis,\nheartburn, abdominal pain, hematemesis, nausea, vomiting,\ndiarrhea, melena, dysuria, changes in bowel or bladder habits,\nrashes, arthralgias, myalgias, polyuria, polydypsia, breathing,\nor bleeding problems.  Review of neurological systems as above.  \n\nPAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Hypertension, diabetes, and elevated\ncholesterol.\n\nMEDICATIONS:  Metoprolol, Zoloft, Zocor, and Captopril.\n\nALLERGIES:  She has no known drug allergies.\n\nSOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient lives in Castle Rock with her son. \nNo history of tobacco or alcohol.\n\nFAMILY HISTORY:  A sister had a stroke.\n\nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Her blood pressure was 150/80, her heart\nrate was 70, respiratory rate of 12.  General:  Pleasant woman in\nno acute distress.  HEENT:  Atraumatic, normocephalic, sclera\nanicteric, and oropharynx is clear.  There is no thyromegaly. \nNeck:  Supple, no bruits, with 2+ carotids.  Heart:  Regular rate\nand rhythm.  Lungs:  Clear to auscultation.  Abdomen:  Has good\nbowel sounds, soft, nontender, no hepatosplenomegaly. \nExtremities:  No clubbing, cyanosis, or edema.  Skin:  No rashes\nor ulcers.  Neurological exam (conducted via her daughter and the\ninterpreter):  She is alert and oriented.  She is attentive.  She\nis non-fluent with really minimal verbal output.  She has\ndecreased naming and decreased comprehension.  She does not have\nany neglect or apraxia.  Registration is 3/4.  Short-term memory\nis 0/4 in 5 minutes.  Pupils are 3 and reactive to 2 millimeters.\n Fundi are normal.  Extraocular movements are intact with\nnystagmus.  Visual fields are full to confrontation.  She has a\nright facial droop.  Facial sensation is intact.  Hearing is\nnormal.  Motor exam:  There is increased muscle tone on the right\narm and leg.  She has strength on the left is normal.  On the\nright, her strength is at least 4/5 in all muscle groups on the\nleft on the neck, except for about 3/5 in the distal arm.  She\nreports decreased pinprick and temperature on the right arm. \nThere is no ataxia on the left.  Gait is slow, walks with a cane,\nand so conducts the right leg.  Her reflexes are brisker on the\nright at about 3 and she has a right plantar extensor response.  \n\nIMAGING DATA:  Initial head CT on 06/18/2067 did not show any\nacute stroke or hemorrhage.  On the CT, there was a question of a\nleft MI cutoff.  CT angiogram also showed a distal left ICA\nstenosis with minimal distal interflow.  MRI of the brain showed\na left MCA infarction involving the left corona radiata, head of\nthe caudate basal ganglia.  She has had mild to moderate chronic\nsmall vessel ischemic changes on her MRI.  Echo showed a normal\nEF of 55% without any clot, no PFO.  \n\nIMPRESSION:  This is a 73-year-old woman with significant\nvascular risk factors, including paroxysmal atrial fibrillation\nwith a left ICA MCA clot resulting in a left MCA territory\ninfarct.  On exam, she has residual aphasia involving both\ncomprehension and fluency; and a moderate right hemiparesis.  It\nis unclear to me why the warfarin was discontinued but given her\nstroke and the documentation of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation\nduring her hospital stay, I think that she would benefit from\nanti-coagulation therapy.  I have asked her to get a follow up\nPCP evaluation at the OCH to determine if indeed there are\nany contraindications to anti-coagulation.  If there are no such\ncontraindications, she should restart on warfarin.  In addition,\nher blood pressure is still not well controlled and I would ask\nher to increase her Captopril to 12.5 mg t.i.d. and to maintain a\nblood pressure diary.  \n\nRECOMMENDATIONS:\n1.  Continue anti-hypertensive and increase Captopril to 12.5 mg\nt.i.d.\n2.  Blood pressure diary for next clinic appointment.\n3.  Continue risk factor modification with the management of\nblood pressure, diabetes, and hypercholesterol as she is doing.\n4.  PCP evaluation for question of bleeding problem during rehab\nstay and resumption of warfarin if there are no contraindications\nper the PCP.\n5.  Continue physical therapy and occupation therapy for gait\ntraining and language rehab.\n6.  Return to clinic in 6 months or sooner if there are any new\nproblems.\n\nMore than 50% of this clinic visit was spent on patient education\nand counseling.\n\n\n\n\n\n______________________________\nJordan Namari Akers, MD, PHD\n\n\nDictated By: Jordan Namari Akers\n\n\neScription document:7-1410500 VSSten Tel\n\n\n\nDD: 09/16/67\nDT: 09/16/67\nDV: 09/16/67\nRecord date: 2069-05-27\n\nMay 27, 2069\n\n\n\nChad Norwood, MD\n\n\n\n\n\nRe: Hannah Heath\n\nOCH #: 91156456\n\n\n\n\n\nDear Dr. Norwood,\n\n \n\nI had the pleasure of seeing your patient, Hannah Heath, for consultation in the Vascular dept at the OCH.  As you know she is a 72 year-old woman with prior stroke. I will review his medical history for our records.\n\n\n\nHPI: This is a 72-year-old right-handed woman with a history of hypertension, diabetes, and hypercholesterolemia and PAF with a prior stroke (2067) who subsequently was admitted to the OCH again for SDH with supratherapeutic INR in 2068. She has a prolonged hospital course as well as rehab stay and now returns having made significant recovery.  She is here with her family who is translating.  She ambulates with walker, but does well over short distances without it.  She communicates well with eth family and is able to feed and dress herself.  She has an aid for bathing three ties per week. She has not needed the PEG tube in the past 6 months and is eager to have it removed.

She has had a significant recovery. Our goal should now be secondary stroke prevention and risk factor modification.  Given that her bleed was a SDH and in the setting of elevated INR, it is worth considering restarting warfarin,  until then, she should at least be on ASA and I have communicated this with them. She should continue with her BP and cholesterol treatment as well. She is eager to remove the PEG and I will refer her to Dr Queen for this. RTC as needed.

I confirm that I have\n\ninterviewed and examined the patient, reviewed the resident's\n\ndocumentation on the patient's chart, and discussed the\n\nevaluation, plan of care, and disposition with the patient. \n\nPlease see the resident's note for further details.\n\nCHIEF COMPLAINT:  Altered mental status.\n\nHISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 76-year-old female\n\nwith history of prior strokes, hypertension, diabetes, and\n\nparoxysmal atrial fibrillation, who presents with altered mental\n\nstatus.  As per report, the patient has not been acting like\n\nherself and not communicating or speaking like herself.  The\n\npatient was in her usual state of health until a few days ago\n\nwhere she started to develop a cough as well as some chills.  The\n\npatient's family members state that the patient has not been out\n\nof bed and has been unwilling to eat.  The patient's family\n\nmembers state that the patient is not acting like her usual self.\n\n The patient's family members deny noting the patient complaining\n\nof any nausea, vomiting, chest pain or shortness of breath.  The\n\npatient was actually taken to clinic yesterday because the\n\npatient was starting to speak less.  The patient was seen clinic\n\nand was thought to be depressed.  The patient has a known history\n\nof a facial droop.  The patient was incontinent of urine today.\n\nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  The patient's vital signs reveal the\n\nfollowing:  Temperature was 102.8, heart rate 110-160 beats per\n\nminute, respiratory rate 20, blood pressure is 144/110, and\n\noxygen saturation was 95% on room air.  The patient's oxygen\n\nsaturation was interpreted as borderline low.  General:  No acute\n\ndistress, multiple family members at bedside.  HEENT:  The\n\npatient's head was normocephalic and atraumatic, no scalp\n\nhematomas.  Pupils were equal, round, and reactive to light. \n\nMucous membranes were somewhat dry, right facial droop noted, no\n\ndrooling.  Neck:  Supple, no JVD, no carotid bruits appreciated. \n\nThere was no meningismus.  Respiratory:  Poor cooperation with\n\nexam.  Fair aeration, no focal rhonchi, rales, or wheezes, no\n\nincreased work of breathing or use of accessory muscles was\n\nnoted.  Cardiovascular:  Irregularly irregular, tachycardic,\n\nunable to appreciate any gross murmurs, rubs, or gallops.  GI: \n\nAbdomen:  Soft, no rebound or guarding, prior well-healed prior\n\nG-tube scar noted.  Rectal exam deferred.  GU exam:  The patient\n\nwas incontinent of urine.  Skin:  Warm and dry.  No rash or\n\nlesions were noted.  Back:  The patient did not have any\n\ncostovertebral angle tenderness.  There is no midline thoracic,\n\nlumbar, or sacral spine tenderness to palpation.  Extremities: \n\nWarm and well perfused, no clubbing, cyanosis or asymmetrical\n\nlower extremity edema was noted.  There were no palpable cords. \n\nNeuro:  The patient was alert, the patient was a verbal.  The\n\npatient grossly moved all 4 extremities with fair strength.  The\n\npatient responded to touch appropriately.  The patient was unable\n\nto cooperate with cranial nerve examination.\n\nINITIAL IMPRESSION AND PLAN:  The patient is a 76-year-old female\n\nwith history of prior stroke, hypertension, diabetes, and\n\nparoxysmal atrial fibrillation, who presents with altered mental\n\nstatus and urinary incontinence.  Differential diagnosis at this\n\ntime includes infectious versus a metabolic abnormality.  The\n\npatient has no new deficits on neuro exam as per the family and\n\nas per review of prior notes.  Repeat stroke is certainly on the\n\ndifferential, however, I have a lower suspicion then for a\n\nmetabolic or infectious etiology.  The patient will need to have\n\na large workup including laboratory studies, urine studies, Foley\n\ncatheter, portable chest x-ray, and repeat noncontrast head CT\n\nscan.\n\nEMERGENCY DEPARTMENT COURSE:  Upon arrival to the Emergency\n\nDepartment, the patient had history and physical exam performed. \n\nThe patient was noted to be in atrial fibrillation with rapid\n\nventricular response.  The patient's 12-lead EKG revealed a rate\n\nof 166 beats per minute, atrial fibrillation with rapid\n\nventricular response, stable T-wave inversions noted over the\n\nlateral leads as well as over the precordial leads.  No definite\n\nST segment abnormalities were noted.  The patient then had a\n\nportable chest x-ray and as per report, the patient's portable\n\nchest x-ray did not reveal any acute cardiopulmonary process or\n\nfindings.  The patient did have a noncontrast head CT scan and\n\nthe patient's noncontrast head CT scan was notable for some\n\nright-sided edema.  The patient will have this followed up with\n\nan MRI of the brain.  The patient's laboratory studies were\n\nnotable for sodium of 131 and potassium of 5.2.  The patient's\n\nlactic acid was 1.7.  The patient's white blood cell count was\n\nnot elevated.  The patient was not anemic.  The patient's\n\nurinalysis was consistent with infection.  The patient's first\n\nset of cardiac markers were negative.  The patient's coagulation\n\nstudies were normal.  The patient was treated with ceftriaxone\n\nfor her urinary tract infection.  The patient could possibly have\n\nurosepsis given her fever and tachycardia.  Urine sepsis is my\n\nleading diagnosis at this time.  The patient's right-sided edema\n\nis certainly concerning, however, I do not feel that the patient\n\nwill need to be admitted to Neurology at this time.  The patient\n\nwill be admitted to medicine for presumed urosepsis.  The patient\n\nwill need to be admitted to a monitor bed.  The patient's blood\n\npressure is normal, and as such, I do not feel that the patient\n\nneeds an intensive care unit bed.  In terms the patient's atrial\n\nfibrillation with rapid ventricular response, the patient was\n\ngiven metoprolol IV.  The patient was not given any oral\n\nmedications secondary to her possible stroke.  The patient was\n\ngiven rectal Tylenol as well as rectal Kayexalate for her\n\nelevated potassium at 5.2.\n\nPRIMARY DIAGNOSES:\n\n1.  Urosepsis.\n\n2.  Atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response.\n\n3.  Hyponatremia.\n\n4.  Hyperkalemia.\n\nDISPOSITION:  The patient was admitted to the Medicine and to a\n\nmonitor bed.\n\nCONDITION AT THE TIME OF DISPOSITION:  Stable, but guarded.\n\n______________________________\n\nYEAGER, CHRISTOPHER M.D.\n\nD: 03/01/72\n\nT: 03/01/72\n\nDictated By: YEAGER, CHRISTOPHER\n\neScription document:4-2135677 IFFocus\n\n ******** Not reviewed by Attending Physician ********"}

I also\n\npersonally interviewed and examined this patient.\n\nHISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 50-year-old female with\n\npast medical history of type 1 diabetes, peripheral vascular\n\ndisease, and hypothyroidism who presents for evaluation of an\n\ninfected left heel ulcer.  The patient is status post bypass\n\ngrafting in her lower extremities and skin grafting of a\n\nnonhealing ulcer on her right heel.  Since that time, she has\n\ndeveloped a chronic nonhealing ulcer on the left heel, which has\n\nbeen followed closely by VNA.  Today, she was seen by her VNA who\n\nwas very concerned about redness and swelling of her left foot\n\nwith redness that extended underneath the plantar surface of the\n\nfoot and over the dorsal surface and concern for infection of\n\nthis ulcer.  The patient has minimal sensation in the left foot. \n\nShe states sometimes she can feel a pressure sensation.  She does\n\nhave some pain when she tries to weightbear, has not noted any\n\nfevers, has noted some chills and states that her fingerstick\n\nearlier today was elevated.

She has an extremely complicated history of R and now L. foot infections and ulcerations, in setting of here severe neuropathy and DM. She originally sustained a R. 5th metatarsal fracture in 2083, with poor union, and subsequent fracture of her 2nd &#8211; 4th metatarsals. She developed a chronic ulcerated callus over her R. lateral metatarsal heads, with underlying osteomyelitis&#8212;this did not improve despite multiple courses of antibiotics. She underwent I+D of her R. foot ulceration in 12/89, OR cultures grew P. aeruginosa. In 3/90, she underwent debridement of her chronic R. lateral plantar ulceration and skin grafting. In 6/90, she underwent deep debridement of her ongoing 5th metatarsal osteomyelitis, along with excision of her 5th metatarsal&#8212;bone cultures grew MSSA. She did well until 2/92, when she underwent R. ankle revision for an equinovarus deformity of her R. hindfoot (calcaneal osteotomy, lateral translation, dorsiflexion first metatarsal osteotomy, and Achilles lengthening). She subsequently developed a R. heel ulceration, and in 4/92, underwent debridement of this ulceration, removal of a screw, and placement of a vacuum sponge. Her wound continued to heal poorly, and she underwent R. SFA to posterior tibial bypass grafting. In 7/92, she underwent debridement of her R. heel wound and placement of a full thickness skin graft, which has taken well; she feels that her R. heel has been healing nicely. During her long hospitalization in 4/92, she started developing L. heel and L. forefoot ulcerations. She attributes the heel ulcerations to chronic pressure from her position in bed, and the forefoot ulcerations to the boots that were used to relieve her heel pressure, which apparently abraded her forefoot chronically. These ulcerations continued to worsen over the next few months, and she presented with cellulitis of this area in 8/92. She received vancomycin, levofloxacin, flagyl initially, then augmentin, with persistent poor healing of her wounds. On 9/10, she underwent operative debridement of her L. plantar heel ulcer&#8212;she was found to have extensive necrotic yellow-brown tissue underlying her L. heel eschar, which was extensively debrided; she received a course of linezolid postoperatively. She had an angiogram on 9/12, which showed no significant flow limiting lesions in her LLE, and good flow through her prior R. SFA to posterior tibial bypas graft. She feels that her wounds have been healing fairly well recently; she feels that her R. heel is almost completely healed, and that her L. heel ulcer is smaller than it was previously. Her L. forefoot ulcer is also more shallow than it was in the past. Over the past 2-3 days, she developed fairly acute swelling, erythema, and pain around her forefoot ulcer, with erythema spreading to the dorsal surface of her foot. She was seen in vascular surgery clinic, and was admitted for antibiotics and further debridement. She has a chronic &#8216;fast heartbeat,&#8217; denies any systemic symptoms (no fevers, chills, sweats, notable weight changes), headaches, sinus symptoms, sore throat, cough, shortness of breath, chest pain, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, diarrhea, blood in her bowel movements, dysuria, frequency, LE edema, rashes, myalgias, or new arthralgias. She feels that her foot erythema has improved significantly overnight with vancomycin.\n\n\nPMH:\n\npoorly controlled type I DM since age 12&#8212;complicated by diabetic retinopathy s/p bilateral vitrectomies for retinal hemorrhage, nephropathy, peripheral neuropathy, autonomic nephropathy (gastroparesis)&#8212;on an insulin pump\nchronic foot ulcerations, initially R, now L, requiring numerous antibiotic courses and operative interventions:\n\n2083: R. 5th metatarsal fracture in 2083, poor union, subsequent fracture of the remainder of her R. metarsals\nchronic ulcerated callus over R. lateral metatarsal heads, with underlying osteomyelitis, no improvement despite multiple courses of antibiotics\n12/89: I+D of R. foot ulceration&#8212;cultures grew P. aeruginosa\n3/90: debridement of chronic R. lateral plantar ulceration and skin grafting\n6/90: deep debridement of her 5th metatarsal osteomyelitis, excision of her 5th metatarsal&#8212;cultures grew MSSA\n2/92: calcaneal osteotomy, lateral translation, dorsiflexion first metatarsal osteotomy, and Achilles lengthening for equinovarus deformity of her R. hindfoot\n4/92: subsequent development of R. heel ulceration, s/p debridement of her ulceration, removal of a screw, vacuum sponge placement\n4/92: R.

Pt was initially treated with insulin and has been requiring insulin since diagnosis. Pt was started on an insulin pump in 2079. Current basal rates are 0.6 units from 12am-6am, 0.7 units from 6am to 6:30pm and then 0.6 units at 6:30pm again. Pt uses a carb ratio of 10:1. Pt cannot recall her correction factor as it is programmed into her pump. Monitors her blood glucoses at least 4 times per day and reports variable glucoses for 70-&gt;200. Reports hypoglycemic episodes 1-2 times per week and she is usually symptomatic with glucoses of 70. Reports that she was admitted to the hospital about one month ago with DKA. States that she had flu-like symptoms and severe vomiting and was admitted ot Ames Pathology Center for treatment. Had never had DKA before. Pt reports complications associated with diabetes. Reports retinopathy and has had several laster surgeries. Reports nephropathy as well as an episode of renal failure related to a hospitalization this summer. Reports peripheral neuropathy as well as peripheral vascular disease, including non-healing ulcers that have lead to right TMA. \n\n\nPatient is admitted for stenosis of right bypass graft stenosis and is going to the cath lab for angiogram shortly. Currently receiving D5W with 150 meq of Bicarb at 125 ccs/hr for renal protection. \nBG today (with IV fluid infusing): 230 (4am), 271 (9am), and 195 (11am - prior to leaving for cath) \nBG 12/25: 152 (1pm), 196 (6pm), 172 (8pm)\nPt is using her insulin pump. \n \nAllergies\nErythromycins - rash \nSulfa - rash\nAspirin - rash\n\n\n\n\nMedications             \nDiabetes medications at home included: Insulin pump, see HPI\nDiabetes medications now include: Insulin pump\n\n\nProblems\nAnemia \nAnxiety \nDeep venous thrombosis \nDepression \nHypothyroidism \nPalpitations \nRight TMA\nLet ankle fracture\n                        \nFHX\nNo history of hormonal disorders in any family members \n                  \nSHX and Habits\nNon-smoker\n \nROS \nPatient is post-operative. \n\n\nPhysical Examination\nGeneral:  Patient is in no apparent distress.  \nVitals: BP 110/60, HR 99, Temp \nHENT: Inspection reveals no abnormalities. \nEyes:  Conjunctivae, sclera and lids are normal. No icterus. \nRespiratory:  Assessment of respiratory effort reveals even respirations without use of accessory muscles\nSkin: No skin rash, warm and dry skin.  No acanthosis nigricans.\nNeurological Examination: Alert and oriented to person, place, time, and situation.

Pt appears alert, oriented and confident to use her insulin pump in the hospital. Pt is able to verbalize her insulin doses and states that she would prefer to continue with pump use. Suspect that IV fluids are contributing to hyperglycemia, therefore reluctant to change insulin doses since IV fluids will likely stop later today. While in procedure, will need to monitor blood glucoses more closely, but anticipate that pump can continue as programmed. \n\n\nRecommendations\n1. Continue with insulin pump. Instructed pt that she must:\n       a. report all pre-meal bolus doses to the RN so that it can be documented on the \n       flow sheet.\n       b. have blood glucoses checked as ordered using the hospital approved glucose meter. \n       c. alert RN if she feel uncomfortable using insulin pump. RN should page HO and/or diabetes dept \n       immediately for orders for SC insulin. \n       d. agree to discontinue insulin pump and start SC insulin if deemed necessary by house staff. \nPt agrees to all of the above. \n \n2. Monitor blood glucoses at least before all meals and at bedtime. Please also check blood glucoses with any symptoms of hypoglycemia or at pt's request. Be sure to record these values on the daily flow sheet. \n \n3. For procedure today, I spoke with Kathryn Kincaid and asked that blood glucoses be monitored hourly while in cath lab unless BG is less than 140. If BG less than 140, monitor blood glucoses every 30 minutes. Treat BG less than 80 with 1/2 amp D50 and continue to monitor as described above. Do not remove insulin pump. Page 5-8112 with any concerns during the procedure. \n \nDiabetes dept will continue to monitor. Please page 5-8112 with any questions or concerns. Thank you.\n \n \n________________________\nFaye Easley, NP\nRecord date: 2094-03-19\n\n\n\n \nInfectious Disease Consult Note \n\n\nPt: Rose Mack\nMR#: 06129040\n\nConsult Date: 3/19/94\n\n\n\nCC/RFC: \nPt is a 52 year old w/ chronic R heel wound, now w/ wound infection. Consultation was requested by Dr. Katz for recommendations regarding antibiotic management.\n\n\n\nHPI:  Pt has longstanding DM and PVD complicated by severe R foot ulceration. She underwent R femoral to posterior tibial bypass graft in 5/92 and skin grafting in 7/92. R heel wound subsequently improved but pt developed L plantar ulceration requiring debridement 10/92. Cultures grew MSSA. Pt was subsequently treated w/ extended course of doxycycline, rifampin through 2/93. She subsequently did well until developing R heel ulcer while undergoing psychiatric hospitalization in mid 2/94. She was initially hospitalized at Altadena Hospital, where she underwent debridement of wound and treatment w/ extended course of penicillin VK and probenicid. Wound failed to improve. Pt was rehospitalized on 3/18 at GCCfor further management. She underwent incision and debridement on 3/18. Intraoperative evaluation revealed ulcer wound tracking to bone.

Also with frontal-occipital headache during this time. He presented to the Sheffield Center ED, and shortly after he was seen his left sided weakness resolved, although his visual field deficits and right hand paresthesia as well as his headache had remained. He denies F/C/N/V. No neck stiffness. \n\n\n\nHe had a noncontrast head CT which was negative for any acute process per radiology read.  He had an LP with 2 WBC, 2 RBC, glucose 98, protein 84, appeared clear. Gram stain with no orgs, rare polys.  ESR 44, crypto ag pending.  He was transferred to HSH because Sheffield Center does not have an MRI machine.\n\n\n\nHe says that his pulmonary status has been stable, and produces a moderate amount of yellow sputum.

Mr. Aguilar is a 48 yo man with h/o CF with mild pulmonary disease, who presented to an OSH on 1/26 with sudden onset of right upper ext paresthesias, followed by a loss of left visual field, diplopia, and left sided weakness.  The patient denies incontinence but had some gait instability related to weakness.  The patient was evaluated at the OSH with non-contrast head CT and L/P which were significant only for elevated CSF protein.  Currently symptoms have resolved other than persistent occipital headache which began with the onset of the other symptoms, as well as unilateral hemianopsia in the left eye evident on exam.  Exam also notable for disdiadochokinesis, otherwise neurologic exam non-focal.  Lung exam notable for diminished BS but no wheezes or crackles.  DDX for above includes ischemic process, though symptoms appear to be multi-focal, vs. mononeuritis multiplex related to inflammatory process.  Less likely is mass lesion leading to above symptoms, or meningeal process.  We plan to obtain CNS MRI, neuro consult.  Will await MRI findings prior to pursuing further serologic work-up.  Continue maintenance medications for CF.\n\n\n\n_______________________\n\nDebra F. Mullen, MD\nRecord date: 2082-09-29\n\nI have personally reviewed the history, examined the patient, and reviewed and edited the note and I agree with the assessment and plan developed under my personal supervision as documented by previosu PA note from Ursula Bowers, PA-C. Please see additional comments below.\n\nVicente Aguilar is a 49 y/o male with cystic fibrosis, moderate to severe lung disease, colonized with mucoid-type Pseudomonas aeruginosa pancreatic insufficiency, CF related DM, HTN, renal insufficiency with proteinuria, recent h/o CVA, gout, cataracts who is currently experiencing a subacute exacerbation of his pulmonary disease requiring hospitalization to initiate IV antibiotics. His symptoms include long-standing fatigue, increased cough and sputum production, some SOB with mild chest tightness and wheezing. His FEV1 significantly decreased during recent clicni visit. He also reports some sinus headaches, but denies sinus pain or tenderness.  He denies hemoptysis, fever/chills, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea or constipation.  Please see details regarding recent MRI/MRA results on PA note above, as well as medications, and other pertinent historical data reviewed independently. \n\nVSS: afebrile, oxygen saturation \nGen: alert, NAD\nHEENT: sclera clear, persistent visual defects right upper quadrant visual field, neck supple\nCV: regular\nLungs: essentially clear with good aeration, no wheezes wuth few scattered ronchi. \nAbdomen: soft, NT, ND, no masses\nExt: warm, clubbing\nNeuro: normal gait, oriented x 3.\n\nAssessment/Plan: Vicente Aguilar is a 49 y/o male with cystic fibrosism noderate to severe lung disease with past medical history as noted above who is currently experiencing a subacute exacerbation of his pulmonary disease requiring hospitalization to initiate IV antibiotics\n\n1. PULM/ID: We will start treatment with tobramycin 700 mg IV q am, as well as  Ceftazidime 2 g IV q 8 hours based on culture results. We will continue maintenance pulmonary medications including bronchodilators, mucolytics and steroids. We will discuss hypertonic saline therapy and trial its use if agreeable. We will send a new sputum sample for culture. Chest x-ray after PICC placement. Will review routine admission labs.\n\n2. CVS: monitor blood pressure assess need for other protective medications. Will continue antihypertensives, ACEi and ARB if creatinine stable. We will review findings from recent MRI/MRA. Check lipid profile if not done, on Zocor. \n\n3. FEN/GI: High calorie, high protein CF diet. \n\n4. Renal: check electrolytes, as well as UA with random protein and creatinine. His creatinine was elevated to 1.6, now 1.5 and was 1.1-1.4 at baseline. He described an incident last week with nausea and vomiting that likely led to above result while taking colchicine, celebrex, and other meds. This is probabyl on its way to improvement. We did not hold ACEi and ARB at this time, but will repeat Cr tonight. He will drink fluids during the day priro to PICC by IR. He does not have a nephrologist adn will need to find him one. He did have a renal biopsy in teh late 60s adn thus will look for results, but renal disease likely multigfactorial. We will tobra levels bvery close adn started at low dose for his size. Will likely check renal US while here.\n\n5. Endo: continue insulin regimen. He will check blood sugars more frequently and folow HgA1c. He did state that he occasionally gets blood sugars in the 40s when he wakes up, but usually nto when he is sedentary, ie. admitted to hospital. IF BS normal here, he will check them very closely at home as well and make adjustments as necesary. We will also need toset him up with Endocrinologist. \n\n6. Access: PICC line to be placed in IR\n\n7. Dispo: 14 day of inpatient IV antibiotics\n\n8. Neuro: He was last seen by Neurologist on 8/30 and was discharged from routine follow-up. He will continue anti-hypertensive meds and ASA. He contineu sot have visual deficit in R upper quadrant.\n\n\n\n\n_____________________________________________\nQuinton Israel,D.O.\nRecord date: 2084-12-07\n\n\nPulmonary Service Admission Note\nVicente Aguilar #98179909\nDecember 7, 2084\n\n\nHPI  51 y/o male with cystic fibrosis, pancreatic insufficency and CRI who was last admitted for cleanout in 1/2084 now presenting after being seen by Dr Mann as outpatient on long island with newly increased creatinine above baseline and to initiate cleanout.

A lot has happened since I last saw him in 10/2119. A CTA revealed severe stenosis of his left ICA. He is status post bilateral carotid endarterectomies and also has known vertebral disease with a history of a left occipital stroke. He subsequently was referred to Dr. Mccarthy and was scheduled to undergo left ICA stent placement in December. In November 1 morning after going to the bathroom he developed sudden onset of vertigo. His wife called 911. He continued to have positional vertigo in the emergency room such that if he sat up he would become very vertiginous and off balance but if he laid with his eyes closed. He felt better. He was found to be orthostatic and his symptoms improved according to the chart by the next day though according to the patient, it took a couple of days for his symptoms to improve significantly. An MRI of the brain was unrevealing for ischemia. Although he significantly improved he still feels &#34;a little off balance&#34;.  He is fine when he is sitting but he notes when he stands up he just &#34;feels off&#34;.  He does not feel acutely vertiginous and does not have any sense of movement but does not feel as steady as he used to on his feet. He has seen Guy in physical therapy and is working on balance therapy. He subsequently did undergo left ICA stent placement on 12/22/2119 without any complication. There was no worsening of his sense of imbalance or no new neurologic symptoms. Also of note, I neglected to mention above, that when he became acutely vertiginous in November there were no other accompanying symptoms. He was discharged after his left carotid endarterectomy on Plavix as well as aspirin that he had been on prior to his admission. He also was switched while in the hospital from hydrochlorothiazide to Inderal for blood pressure control although he was orthostatic sitting up.  Lying down he was hypertensive. He has had no new neurologic symptoms since his discharge from NDMG after his carotid endarterectomy on 12/22/2119. \n\nCURRENT MEDICATIONS: Aspirin, gemfibrozil, nifedipine, Plavix, propranolol, ranitidine. \n\nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION: Pleasant, healthy-appearing 74-year-old male. Blood pressure 160/90 sitting, standing 155/90. Cranial nerve examination notable for right homonymous hemianopsia. Auscultation of the neck: Unremarkable. No bruits. There are bilateral CEA scars. Motor examination: No drift. Power 5/5 throughout. Fine finger movements intact. In the lower extremities. Power 5/5 on the right. The left he is status post left knee fusion. The left iliopsoas and dorsiflexion are full strength. His gait shows left limp due to knee fusion, but he appears steady. DTRs 1+ throughout. \n\nDATA: MRI of the brain in 11/2119 shows chronic left occipital lobe infarct otherwise unremarkable. CTA of the head and neck 11/14/2119 showed stable left PCA territory chronic infarct with encephalomalacia and nonspecific periventricular white matter hypoattenuation as previously described. CTA of the head showed stable moderate stenosis of the left supraclinoid ICA. Stable occlusion or near occlusion of the left vertebral artery at the dural penetration to the take off of the PICA. There is reconstruction of contrast in the distal aspect. There is moderate stenosis of the distal left interdural vertebral artery with severe stenosis at the left vertebrobasilar junction and also unchanged.  Stable moderate to severe stenosis within the right intradural vertebral artery.  Mild areas of stenosis within the basilar artery and left T1 and T2 segments also unchanged. A CTA of the neck shows a short segment of severe stenosis of the proximal left ICA, which is stable since the most recent study.  The right carotid artery demonstrates no significant stenosis. Dominant right vertebral artery with hypoplastic left vertebral artery demonstrates moderate stenosis at its origin and diffuse areas of moderate stenosis of the throughout unchanged. Mild to moderate right subclavian artery stenosis just proximal to the vertebral artery take off unchanged. Multiple thyroid nodules as described since most recent study. New ground glass nodule in the lower lobe the right lung, which is likely inflammatory in nature. Followup chest x-ray 11/14/2119 was unremarkable. Cardiac ultrasound shows evidence of a PFO, which is now noted following performance of Valsalva maneuver not previously noted.  In 09/2113 Holter monitor was unremarkable. \n\nIMPRESSION: A 74-year-old male with long-standing cerebrovascular disease and history notable for left occipital lobe infarct with vertebrobasilar disease as described above, status post bilateral carotid endarterectomies with recent restenosis on the left treated with stenting in 12/2119.  He has been doing well considering. \n\nThe cause of his episode of vertigo and imbalance is unclear.  It is difficulty to tease out whether or not this was a posterior circulation TIA versus small stroke not detected on MRI versus vasovagal etiology. He checks out well today and I do not find any new findings on examination and his walking is steady though subjectively he feels he is not quite back to baseline. Agree with Plavix added to his aspirin dose after his carotid stent placement. His blood pressure is a little high today. He will be following up with Dr. Kinney in 2 weeks. Recommended that he continue to work with Guy on vestibular therapy. \n\nFollowup with me in 3 months. \n\n\n___________________________\nTaniya Xing, M.D.\n\n\ncc:\n\n\nDD: 01/20/2120 11:05:58\nTD: 01/21/2120 07:49:40\nTR: 7038300\nBackJob ID:  6183328\nVoiceJob ID:  62867896\nRecord date: 2121-06-06\n\nReason for Visit Here for CPE and f/u on chronic cough/HTN (not using flovent).

Albright, M.D.\nColumbia Kingwood Medical Center\n57 Wood St, Q6-24\nNorth Andover, KY  41454\n\n\nHISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Ms. Uhrich is a 73-year-old woman with past medical history notable for hypertension and dyslipidemia, but no coronary artery disease who presents with a three-day history of progressive weakness and lightheadedness.  The history is obtained in Spanish from the patient and through her daughter who assisted with translation.  In general, she has apparently been doing well with no episodes of chest discomfort or exertional dyspnea until roughly three days ago when she has began to notice episodic problems with walking even short distances before she feels as though she might pass out.  The episodes have occurred multiple times per day and after a particularly severe episode this morning, she brought her mother to the emergency department for evaluation.  There have been no syncopal episodes and no complaints of palpitations, orthopnea, PND, or lower extremity edema.  The patient has not had symptoms like this before and has been chronically treated with atenolol for hypertension for many years.\n\n\nHer only cardiovascular evaluation has been with adenosine MIBI in 2085, which revealed normal systolic function and no evidence for ischemia.\n\n\nPAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Notable for hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, gastritis, and osteoarthritis.  She also carries the diagnosis of diabetes mellitus but is not currently treated for this.\n\n\nMEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:  Included amitriptyline 25 mg at bedtime, aspirin 81 mg daily, atenolol 25 mg daily, Lipitor 10 mg at bedtime, hydrochlorothiazide/lisinopril 25/20 one tablet daily, loratadine 10 mg daily, and Protonix 40 mg daily.\n\n\nShe developed gastrointestinal irritation with higher doses of aspirin.\n\n\nSOCIAL AND FAMILY HISTORY:  As noted in the housestaff notes.\n\n\nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  In the Emergency Department, her heart rate is 38 beats per minute and her blood pressure is 110/70 mmHg.  Her venous pressures are low and there are BLANK waves present every other beat.  The chest is clear to auscultation and percussion bilaterally.  Cardiovascular exam reveals bradycardia with normal S1, wide physiologically split S2, and an audible S4.  There is no murmur.  The abdomen is soft and nontender.  The liver is not palpably enlarged.  The extremities are warm without edema.\n\n\nElectrocardiogram reveals sinus rhythm with 2:1 AV block and right bundle-branch block.  There is left axis deviation consistent with left anterior fascicular block.\n\n\nThere is no response of her heart rate to mild calisthenics in the bed.\n\n\nLaboratories are notable for normal BUN to creatinine ratio of 23/1.2 with a potassium of 4.1 and a hematocrit of 35%.  Initial cardiac biomarkers were negative.\n\n\nIn summary, Karson Uhrich is a 73-year-old woman with hypertension and dyslipidemia who presents with a three-day history of presyncope and weakness in the context of a new diagnosis of 2:1 AV block.  Review of previous electrocardiograms reveals no right bundle-branch block and left anterior fascicular block and of late this represents progression of her underlying conduction system disease.  We will proceed to permanent temporary pacemaker implantation for backup support and will arrange electrophysiologic consultation for permanent pacemaker implantation.  There is no history to suggest an ischemic syndrome, so I did not think additional pharmacologic stress test is necessary.  Her beta-blocker will be held overnight in addition to her amitriptyline to see if this facilitates recovery of her AV nodal function.  Overall, I think this likely represents infra-hisian block and a pacemaker should be curative therapy.  Additional plans will be dictated by her clinical course.\n\n\n\n\n______________________________\nXavier Alvin Kaufman, MD\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\neScription document:3-6100190 IFFocus\n\n\nCC: Owen Quentin-Xiong M.D.\nColumbia Kingwood Medical\n35 Wood St\nNorth Andover, KY 41454\n\n\n\n\nDD: 09/28/90\nDT: 09/28/90\nDV: 09/28/90\nRecord date: 2092-05-05\n\n05/05/2092\nSpanish\n81 Wood St UHRICH, KARSON\nNorth Andover, KY 41454 45630268\n(884) 486-9594 07/01/2091\nHISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: Ms. Uhrich is 75.

Following the diagnosis, he was discharged to Bellaire City Hospital, where he continued to experience falls.  After one episode, he was forcibly picked up, and began to have L shoulder pain thereafter.  He also noted a cut over the L elbow on transfer to the NH that was slow to heal.   After several weeks of worsening shoulder pain, erythema, and warmth, he was re-hospitalized at Ouagadougou, where he underwent L shoulder aspiration.  MRI 10/87 demonstrated complete rupture of the rotator cuff, with associated large joint effusion.  Of note, he denied fevers, chills, or NS.\n\nL shoulder aspiration 10/10/87 demonstrated purulent fluid, with 2,800,000 WBC (97%PMN). Gram stain demonstrated GPC in clusters.  He subsequently underwent L shoulder I&D 10/12, with removal of 300cc of frankly purulent fluid.  He was started on cefazolin.  Culture results returned a pan-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus isolate (including to ampicillin, cefazolin, clindamycin, penicillin, rifampin).  Blood cultures were negative.  He was taken back to the OR 10/16 for arthroscopy, with extensive debridement.  Interop findings included demonstration of significant fibrinous tissue, with no normal-appearing cartiledge present.  A penrose was placed into a large cavity down the subdeltoid rescess, and a second in the subacromial space.  He was transitioned to ampicillin 2g q6 hours x 2 weeks, and then given amoxicillin (either 1g BID or 500mg TID, unsure which) x 2 weeks.  \n\n\n\nRepeat R shoulder MRI obtained 12/12/87, which was reviewed with staff radiologist, and demonstrated again complete tear of the supra/infraspinatus/teres minor/ subscapularis/ biceps tendons, with also persistent large joint effusion, extensive synovitis, and full thickness cartiledge loss of glenoid and humeral head.  Also noted was possible AVN of medial portion of the humeral head. Overall, was difficult to tell from MRI whether findings represented prior vs active disease.  \n\n\n\nMr. Moss was seen in the ID clinic 1/18, at which time he complained of a several week h/o progressively worsening L shoulder discomfort with activity.  He did not experience shoulder pain at rest, and had not recently noted erythema.  No drainage.  Appetite was near baseline, though he had experienced fatigue.  Blood glucoses had been well controlled.  His daughter in law brought in extensive data on his home vital signs, which revealed absence of fever except for a single isolated temp of 103, with stable pulse/BP, and overall well controlled blood sugars.    \n\n\n\nDate \t\tESR\tCRP\n\n12/6/87\t88 \t23\n\n12/19/87\t96\t28\n\n1/18/88\t67\t9.4\n\n\n\nUnfortunately,  Mr. Moss sustained a mechanical fall 1/19.  Following the fall, he had significantly increased hip pain.  Hip/pelvis films notable for femoral component with lucency measuring more than 2mm superolaterally and along the stem. Orthopedic team felt that loosening of hardware would require another hip revision.  \n\n\n\nROS: as per HPI.  Denied having R hip pain prior to his fall.

The acetabular component demonstrates vertical inclination with evidence of polyethylene wear. The femoral component demonstrates lucency measuring more than 2mm superolaterally and along the stem consistent with granulomatous disease. There is no subsidence or loosening based on Grauer's classification.\n\n\n\nAP chest film: no acute pulmonary process, probable cardiomegaly.\n\n\n\nAssessment: 77 yo M with DMII, CHF (EF 20-25%), afib, Parkinson's, prostate cancer s/p XRT c/b proctitis and GIB, multiple hip replacements, recently treated for S. aureus L shoulder septic arthritis (10/87 - 11/87) who presented 1/19 s/p fall.  With regards to his shoulder, it is difficult to know whether his infection was cured by the 4-week abx course.  Though his shoulder does not appear to be grossly infected on exam, 2 months after completion of his course, it is too early to determine sterilization of the shoulder on a clinical basis.  The MRI is difficult to interpret, and may well reflect prior inflammatory changes.  He did have persistently elevated inflammatory markers (though confounded by multiple comorbidities).  Given the possibility that he had cleared the infection, our plan as of the clinic visit Wednesday had been to observe him clinically, off abx, for signs of recurrent infection.  However, given his fall and the possibility of new hardware placement, would now favor a more aggressive workup of his shoulder.  As such, would recommend shoulder aspiration off antibiotics.  \n\n\n\nThe source for the L shoulder staph infection was never elucidated, and blood cultures were negative.  However, such septic arthritis often results from hematogenous seeding, and there is a small change that his R hip may also have become infected.  This could help to explain the prosthesis loosening.  Alternatively, he may have had hardware mechanical failure in setting of falls, or less likely involvement by his prostatic ca (?read of granulomatous disease around the prosthesis).  \n\n\n\nRecommendations:\n\n-hold antibiotics, including pre-operative prophylactic antibiotics to allow optimal culture data\n\n-Aspirate shoulder.  Send fluid for cell counts, Gram stain, aerobic/anaerobic/fungal cultures\n\n-if do not see contraindication to proceeding with planned hip replacement\n\n-would obtain hip biopsies in the OR, again off abx, to assess for possible hip infection\n\n-likewise, would send OR hip specimen to pathology to assess for infection vs. neoplastic involvement\n\n-check CK, given elevated Cr following fall, and possible rhabdo\n\n\n\nThank you for this interesting consultation.  We will continue to follow with you.\n\n___________\n\nYair Gillespie \n\nPager #52719\n\nInfectious disease fellow\nRecord date: 2088-09-04\n\n\n\n\nBeckley Appalachian Regional Hospital\n315 Townsend West              MOSS, DEREK\nEspanola, WI  85976                    89659991\n895-239-5445                     09/04/2088\n\n\nREASON FOR VISIT:  Follow up with Mr. Derek Moss who is here with his son and daughter-in-law with multiple problems and for preop check of electrolytes.  Mr. Moss is 78 years old.\n\nMEDICAL PROBLEM LIST:\n1.  Diabetes mellitus type 2, insulin dependent.\n2.  Left shoulder pain.  Scheduled for surgical care tomorrow.\n3.  GI bleeding, ongoing.\n4.  Parkinson's disease.\n5.  Fatigue.\n6.  BCE.\n\nMEDICATIONS:  Medication list updated on the LMR.  Major change is furosemide now 60 mg b.i.d. instead of 80.\n\nINTERIM HISTORY:\n1.  Hyperkalemia occurred on higher dose of Lasix.  Apparently this has been a problem in the past.  He also bumped his creatinine to 2.3.  Potassium rechecked today and is now down to 5.1, stable creatinine.\n2.  Diabetes.  Blood sugars running in the 80s in the morning, higher later in the day on 16 units of Lantus sliding scale to cover other meals.  Uses regular insulin about twice a day.\n3.  GI bleeding ongoing by Mr. Moss's report, still having clots of blood, no abdominal pain, has not had GI follow up recently, is off Coumadin prior to shoulder repair.\n3.  Skin lesions, one on his left leg, one on his right medial leg and a lump on his back noticed by his daughter when she was giving him a therapeutic massage.\n4.  Left shoulder pain.  Scheduled for surgery in the a.m.\n\nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  He is brighter, cheerier, acutely oriented.  No acute pain.  Vital Signs:  Blood pressure 126/57, pulse 66 and regular, respirations 12 and unlabored, weight 161.  Skin shows seborrheic keratoses, actinic keratoses on the right leg, papule with eschar on the left leg, a subcutaneous nodule on the right upper back.  Chest is clear P&A.  Cardiac exam regular rate and rhythm, normal S1, S2, II/IV apical systolic murmur radiating to the left sternal border.  No gallop.  Extremities, trace edema.  Decreased ROM R shoulder.  Abdomen soft.  Neurologic, alert and oriented.\n\nIMPRESSION AND PLAN:  Hyperkalemia resolving.  Discussed importance of careful fluid balance, low-protein diet given azotemia, renal follow up, follow up with GI for GI bleeding, blood transfusions are available.  Continue lower dose of Lasix.  Skin lesions include seborrheic dermatitis, seborrheic keratoses, possible lipoma, although lump on his back is firm and may need a biopsy once he has recovered from shoulder surgery.  Long consultation with him and his daughter regarding home care after surgery.\n\n\n______________________________\nUrsula Yawn, MD\n\n\n\n\n\neScription document:7-9274121 EMSSten Tel\n\n\n\nDD: 09/04/88\nDT: 09/05/88\nDV: 09/04/88\nRecord date: 2089-03-11\n\nEDVISIT^89659991^MOSS, DEREK^03/11/89^GODFREY, XAVIER GEORGE\n\nI saw this patient with the resident, Dr. Louvinia Duvall.  Please\n\nsee her note for further details.  I confirm that I have\n\ninterviewed and examined the patient, reviewed the resident's\n\ndocumentation on the patient's chart, and discussed the\n\nevaluation, plan of care, and disposition with the patient.\n\nHISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 78-year-old male\n\nwith a history of diabetes, hypertension, atrial fibrillation,\n\ncongestive heart failure, prostate cancer, chronic renal\n\ninsufficiency, and Parkinson disease previously hospitalized 2\n\nweeks prior for right lower extremity cellulitis, which he had a\n\nPICC line placed, and was discharged to home on vancomycin. \n\nSince that time, he has had progressively increase in his\n\ncreatinines despite decreasing doses of vancomycin.  He was\n\nconcerned and requested that the patient to come in for a\n\npossible acute renal failure secondary to the antibiotic.  There\n\nis also concern that cellulitis had worsened, as the patient was\n\nexperiencing increasing weakness.  He is denying currently any\n\nfevers, chills, or constitutional symptoms.  His baseline\n\nshortness of breath has been going on for months.  No GI\n\ncomplaints.  He has had a mild headache, but no visual changes,\n\nno focal motor or sensory loss.\n\nREVIEW OF SYSTEMS: The systems reviewed and found to be negative.\n\nMEDICATIONS:  He has a long list of medications Please see the\n\nchart.\n\nALLERGIES:  Morphine.\n\nSOCIAL HISTORY:  Reviewed and found to be noncontributory.\n\nFAMILY HISTORY:  Reviewed and found to be noncontributory.\n\nPAST SURGICAL HISTORY:  Cholecystectomy and bilateral total hip\n\nreplacement.\n\nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  He is awake, alert, nontoxic appearing,\n\nand in no acute distress.  Vital signs reviewed and found to be\n\nwithin normal limits.  Afebrile at 95.6.  HEENT exam is\n\nunremarkable.  Mucosal membranes are moist.  Neck is supple. \n\nLungs are clear bilaterally.  Heart is regular rate and rhythm,\n\nno murmurs or gallops.  Abdomen:  Soft, nondistended, and\n\nnontender with normoactive bowel sounds.  Skin is warm and dry. \n\nExtremity exam:  He has right lower extremity cellulitis with 2\n\nsmall ulcerations and serosanguineous drainage is minimal.  No\n\nevidence of pus.  It is about where it was at the start based on\n\nthe initial skin markings.\n\nLABORATORY DATA:  Hematocrit of 32.  However, his BUN has been\n\n150 and creatinine of 3.  This has significantly increased from\n\nhis baseline of 1.8-2 he has had in the past.  Vancomycin level\n\nwas sent.\n\nDIAGNOSIS:  Cellulitis with acute renal insufficiency most likely\n\nsecondary to vancomycin.  This was discussed with his primary\n\ncare provider.\n\nDISPOSITION:  He is admitted to the Medicine Service.\n\n______________________________\n\nGODFREY, XAVIER GEORGE MD\n\nD: 03/17/89\n\nT: 03/17/89\n\nDictated By: GODFREY, XAVIER GEORGE\n\neScription document:7-3638497 BFFocus\n\n ******** Not reviewed by Attending Physician ********\nRecord date: 2090-02-18\n\n                                                       Patient Name: MOSS,DEREK P [ 89659991(QMC) ] \n\n                                                         Date of Visit: 02/18/2090\n\n\n\n\n\nProblems\n\n      Parkinsons disease\n\n      Diabetes mellitus type 2\n\n      Congestive heart failure\n\n      Atrial fibrillation\n\n      Pacemaker\n\n      Gastroesophageal reflux disease\n\n      Hyperlipidemia\n\n      Chronic renal dysfunction\n\n      H/O basal cell carcinoma\n\n      H/O prostate cancer\n\n\n\nChief Complaint\n\nComes in for his 2 month follow up visit\n\n\n\nHistory of Present Illness\n\n79 year old male comes in with his son for a follow up.\n\nHe reports right LE swelling and redness increasing over the last 1 week.

Had a CT scan later that showed the same and recommended an MRI. She had it done few 9/86. Recommended to repeat it soon. Left lower pole renal lesion with MRI signal characteristics consistent with a cystic, septated, unenhancing renal lesion or bosniak grade 2. However, when compared to prior CT examination demonstrating late filling of this lesion, follow up is warranted to exclude a cystic renal neoplasm making this an overall bosniak grade 2F. \n\n\n\n\n\nReview of Systems\t\n\nC/P: Denies PND, orthopnea.

I agree with the findings and recommendations in Dr. Lilly's note, with any small exceptions or points of emphasis noted below.  Please refer to it for details of HPI, PMH, medications and allergies, family and social history, laboratory and other data, and ROS.  I would only add/emphasize the following:\n\n\n\nMr. Gillespie is a 53 year-old man with medical history that includes: \n\nh/p Hodgkin&#8217;s lymphoma, 2070-2071, treated with local resection, bleomycin, adriamycin, and other agents, XRT to a wide chest field \nAtrial fibrillation - diagnosed in 3/84; on warfarin, metoprolol \nPectus excavatum &#8211; repair failed as a child \nPneumonia several times in the past \nCentral obesity &#8211; weighs about 315#, down from a high of 360# \nType II diabetes mellitus, last A1C 6.4, on metformin only, 1000 mg BID \nHypertension, on lisinopril 10 mg, Toprol XL \nElevated lipids - on statin \nNeurofibromatosis (Soft tissue mass in right apex noted on 3/84 CT may be neurogenic tumor.) \nKidney stones \nPatent foramen ovale\n\n\nHe presents with dyspnea, orthopnea, and palpitations as described by Dr. Lilly, and was found to be in atrial fibrillation/flutter with rapid ventricular response.  He has improved with heart rate control.  \n\n\nExam\nVS - as noted\nGeneral - pleasant obese white man with severe pectus deformity.  Breathing with abdominal muscles tensed on expiration.  \nCV - heart with regular rhythm, normal S1, prominent S2, and no murmurs, rubs, or gallops\nLungs - clear\nAbdomen - obese\nExtremities - minimal edema\n\n\nData  - reviewed in detail and are as in Dr. Lilly's note.  Bicarb 31, BNP 2050, WBC 15, INR 3.1.\n\n\n\n\nImpression:  Poorly tolerated atrial fibrillation/flutter with RVR, needing better rate control.  Given the severe pectus deformity as well as his history of lung-toxic chemotherapy drugs and XRT, he may have some restrictive lung disease that would limit his cardiopulmonary reserve.  I would not be surprised if he additionally has obstructive lung disease, given the \"belly breathing\" and the wheezing he had last admission.  \n\n\nRecommendations:  \n\nIncrease metoprolol dose.  May need Toprol XL 100 BID.  Best to maximize utility of BB prior to adding other agents.\n\nFilter all IVs (PFO)\nPFTs and Pulmonology consult as an outpatient\nBalance of plan per Dr. Lilly.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPeter Wiggins, MD, PhD\npager 32089\nRecord date: 2084-06-15\n\n\n\nPATIENT: Patrick Gillespie\nMRN: 2571454\nADMIT DATE: 6/13/84\nTRANSFER DATE: 6/15/84\nATTN: Wright\n\n\n\n\nReason for admission/transfer: aflutter starting on sotalol\n\n\nHPI\nPlease see admission note for full details.\n\n\nIn brief, this is a 54 y/o M hx neurofibromatosis, Hodgkin's lymphoma s/p chemo/XRT in the 70s, DMII (A1c 6.5 in 03/84), HTN, obesity and new diagnosis of Afib, recently discharged from the Mediquik 2 days prior to readmission 6/13 where he was being treated for AF w/ RVR.  His toprol was increased from 100mg dily to 100mg BID at that time. Prior w/u w/ fairly nl TTE and nl TSH. Now returned for his third admission with AF w/ RVR, rates into the 140s. He is considerably symptomatic with the AF w/ palpitations, lightheadedness, dyspnea, and diaphoresis. HD stable.

He was also given 0.5mg digoxin for possible dig load. Given he was failing on Toprol 100mg BID his medications were switched to diltiazem 60mg q6hr to see if a different drug class might help. Cardiology/ EP was consulted for the possibility of ablation given this was his third admission and he is so symptomatic. EP decided to start the patient on sotalol 80-mg BID with the plan to increase sotalol to 120mg BID on 6/15 if Qtc remains stable ( &lt;500 msec). He is planned to received 5 doses of sotalol prior to dispo and if he remained in aflutter through 6/15 is to get DCCV on 6/16. He received his first and only dose in the pm 6/14. Overnight he was bradycardic into the 40s while sleeping. He had a 3.5 second pause however on telemetry. His heart rates have ranged from 45-60 in AFlutter. BPs 90s systolic.

She denies any \nchest pain or heart palpitation.  She denies any shortness of \nbreath.  She denies any nausea, vomiting or diarrhea.  She denies \nany frequency, dysuria or thirst.  She has a history of non-\ninsulin-dependent diabetes at this time.\n\nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Her temperature was 98.5 degrees p.o., her \npulse was 80, her blood pressure was 118/60 in her right arm.  \nHer weight was 117 pounds, which reflects a one-pound weight loss \nsince her last visit.  Her blood sugar, which was random, was \n159, her last meal being at 12 noon.  Her son, who accompanied \nher states that it is questionable whether she is taking her \nmedications as instructed and voiced an interest in having his \nmother take insulin, which she has taken in the past.  Her heart \nhad a regular rate and rhythm at 80.  There was no evidence of \nany peripheral edema.  Examination of her toes revealed presence \nof some tinea interdigitally.\n\nASSESSMENT:\n1.  Non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus, moderate control.\n2.  Tinea pedis.\n\nPLAN:  Medication refills were given for Glucotrol 5 mg dispensed \nNo. 120 with two refills, two p.o. q.a.m., two p.o. q.p.m., \nGlucophage 500 mg No. 90 one p.o. q.a.m., two p.o. q.p.m., and \nAvandia 2 mg No. 30 with two refills one p.o. q.a.m., and a new \nprescription for Lotrimin AF 1% cream dispensed 12 g with one \nrefill, apply to the affected area b.i.d. for up to four weeks.\n\n\n\n\nXian, Imogene\n64187177\n07/30/72\nPage 2\n\nThe patient has an appointment scheduled with her primary care \nprovider Dr. Paul Shaw for 8/16/72, and was advised to \nkeep that appointment.\n\n\n\nGrace Vann, N.P.\n\nGV:arreola:06:278:08;37-60093.doc;DD:07/30/72;DT:08/01/72;DV:07/30/72;\nRecord date: 2073-05-29\n\n\nInternal Medicine\n97 Weld St                                        Xian, Imogene\nGrandview, NE 13472                                      81376761\n(552) 598-5590                                           05/29/73\n\n\nHISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Ms. Xian is 75 years of age. \nShe has adult-onset diabetes, which in the past has required\ntreatment with insulin.  She has been managed with oral\nhypoglycemics because of her reticence to using injections. \nShe also has a history of CVA.\n\nI last saw her in August of last year.  She was seen by Ms.\nVann, our nurse practitioner in early May.\n\nCURRENT MEDICATIONS:  Glipizide 5 mg two in the morning and\ntwo in the evening, Plavix 75 mg one p.o. q.d., and Avandia\n2 mg one p.o. q.a.m.  According to Ms. Vann's note of Apr\n29, 2073, she is also supposed to be taking metformin 500 mg\none in the morning and two with the evening meal as was\nprescribed back in 2072.  The patient and her son today are\nnot sure that she is taking this medication.  In fact, they\nbelieve that she is not.  There has been moderate polyuria\nand polydipsia.  Control of diabetes has been erratic. \nHemoglobin A1c has been elevated.  On Apr 29, 2073, blood\nglucose was 274, BUN was 25, creatinine 1.0, electrolytes\nwithin normal limits as was calcium.  Cholesterol was 315. \nHemoglobin A1c 10.6.  The patient has not experienced chest\npain, palpitations but she is moderately short of breath\nwhen climbing stairs.  There has been no orthopnea and no\nPND.  She denies dysuria and urgency and has not experienced\nnear syncope.  She denies nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and\nconstipation.\n\nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  On physical examination today, she\nappears well.  Blood pressure 122/66.  The heart rate is 90\nand regular, weight 113 pounds, approximately five pounds\nless than last year.  Random blood glucose was 224.\n\nThe patient suffered a minor CVA back in September 2071. \nShe denies any recurrence of motor deficits or symptoms\nsuggestive of TIA.  The patient has a past history of\nhyperthyroidism that was treated with iodine 131.  She has\nnot been hypothyroid since then.  In fact, the last TSH\nlevel was 0.05 in August of last year, just prior to her\ndeparture to Ghana.  She denies heat intolerance as well\nas palpitations.\n\nOn physical examination, she is a small lady in no acute\ndistress.  The neck veins are flat.  The extraocular\nmovements are full.  There are no symptoms of\nhyperthyroidism.  The chest is clear to auscultation.  The\nheart sounds are regular.  There are no rubs or gallops. \nThe lower extremities are free of edema and now her toes are\nfree of fungi but the nails are overgrown and require\nattention.\n\nASSESSMENT AND PLAN:  A 76 year old woman with a past\nhistory of hyperthyroidism, which was treated with I-131\nwith good results who, last year before she left the\ncountry, had a subnormal TSH.  She does not have obvious\nsymptoms of hyperthyroidism but today I have obtained a\nrepeat TSH as well as T3 and T4.\n\nDiabetes continues to be a problem.  Glycemic control\ncontinues to be difficult to achieve.  Today, I have\nreinstated metformin at 500 mg p.o. q.d.  The son is going\nto check on the medications to make certain that indeed she\nis not taking this medicine at this point.  The other\nmedications were continued.  It is indeed possible that she\nwill need insulin in the near future.  I plan close followup\nand will see her again in six weeks' time.  If she is\nhyperthyroid, this may also explain the difficulty in\nachieving glycemic control.  Against this is the high\ncholesterol.  She used to be on Lipitor, which was\ndiscontinued during her trip to Ghana.  I have\nreinstated the Lipitor today 20 mg p.o. q.d.  I have also\nadded a small dose of enalapril 2.5 mg p.o. q.d. to protect\nher kidneys even though she is not hypertensive.\n\n\n______________________________\nKevin Shamar-Trevino, M.D.\n\n\neScription document:0-389401 NFFocus\n\nDD: 05/29/73\nDT: 05/30/73\nDV: 05/29/73\nRecord date: 2080-06-15\n\n\nWalk-in visit because of  \nPt of Dr Shamar \nSeen in the EW bo  HA , work up negative.

As you will remember he recently underwent right carotid endarterectomy with Dacron patch angioplasty after treatment of a severe underlying pneumonia.  He returns today reporting that he is doing well from a neurologic standpoint.  He has had no focal, motor, sensory deficits, and no amaurosis fugax.  A follow up duplex examination performed in our vascular laboratory reveals mild right ICA disease after his carotid endarterectomy with moderate left ICA stenosis which should be followed over time.  \n\n\n\nAssessment and plan:  Overall, I am extremely pleased with Mr. Pearson's outcome given his high risk pulmonary status.  It would be prudent to see him again in follow up evaluation in six months' time with a repeat carotid duplex examination.  I would be happy to assist in the management of this or any of your other patients as you deem necessary in the future.  Thank you again for allowing me to assist in his care.  If I can be of any further assistance, please feel free to contact either myself or one of my partners directly.\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\tSincerely,\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\tSteven E.

Of note, he was hospitalized from May 26 until May 29 for a COPD flare, and was discharged home at that time on a prednisone taper, which he completed about one week ago.  He was in his usual state of good health and had even spent the past weekend with family in Connecticut camping.  But on the evening of June 13 he began to feel short of breath, without cough or chest pain, and the dyspnea was made worse with exertion.  Not made worse with lying down.  He also had a fever to 103, without mental status changes.  EMS was called and in the field he was noted to be breathing at a rate in the 40s; he was given a dose of IV lasix and he put out 600cc of urine.  He was then brought to the WMC ED where he continued to display labored breathing, breathing in the 40s, afebrile, tachycardic to 147bpm.  An ABG on BIPAP showed 7.35/53/100.  His blood pressure dropped from systolic 130s to 70/50, and so he was subsequently intubated, and a central and arterial lines placed.  He was given approximately 2L of NS with resultant CVP of 11.  He was also started on dopamine, which was eventually transitioned to norepinephrine.  He was given vancomycin, levaquin, and flagyl, as well as a dose of solumedrol.  He was then transferred to the Internal Medicine.\n\nReview of Systems: per HPI; no changes in mental status; no cough, chest pain, palpitations; no N/V/C/D; no BRBPR or melena; no sick contacts.\n\nPast Medical History\nCOPD on home O2 2LNC at all times, never been intubated\nCerebrovascular disease: s/p R CEA, and with L ICA on aspirin\nDM2\nLung cancer: s/p L partial resection\nBPH\nPTSD\n\nMedications on Admission\nAlbuterol and atrovent nebulizers prn\nAdvair 250/50 2puffs bid\nASA 325mg po qd\nCalcium and vitamin D 250mg po bid\nLasix 10mg po qd\nNeurontin 300mg po tid\nGuaifenasin 10mL tid\nZantac 150mg po bid\nSenna 2tabs bid\nZocor 20mg po qhs\nLosartan 100mg po qd\nToprol XL 100mg po qd\nLoratidine 10mg po qd\n\nAllergies: bactrim and tetracycline, reactions unknown\n\nSocial History: retired Civil Engineer, positive asbestos exposure; quit smoking 30 years ago; no EtOH or illicits\n\nFamily History: denies any known family history of lung disease, COPD, CAD, or cancer\n\nPhysical Exam\nGen: NAD, appears comfortable\nVS: T96.1 bp118/60 without pressors P93 CVP 6-9 O2sat 97% on mechanical ventilation\nHEENT: R eye not reactive to light; L eye 3  2mm with light; EOMI\nNeck: supple, JVP flat\nPulm: ronchi bilaterally without wheezing or crackles\nCor: regular, nls1s2, no mumurs\nAbd: soft, NTND, +BS, no HSM\nExt: trace lower edema bilaterally; warm, DP 2+ B\nNeuro: no focal findings, pt appropriate; CN 2-12 intact, tongue midlines, strength 5/5 all extremities, toes downgoing\n\nLabs\n\nDate/Time         NA             K              CL             CO2            \n06/14/2132                       4.3                                          \n06/14/2132        138            4.1            101            29.1           \nDate/Time         BUN            CRE            GLU            \n06/14/2132                                      132 (H)        \n06/14/2132        30 (H)         1.6 (H)        123 (H)        \n\nDate/Time         CA             PHOS           MG             TBILI          \n06/14/2132        9.4            4.1            1.4            0.9            \nDate/Time         DBILI          TP             ALB            GLOB           \n06/14/2132        0.0            6.7            3.4            3.3            \nDate/Time         LACT           \n06/14/2132        1.2            \n\nDate/Time         TEMP           FIO2           bPO2           bPCO2          \n06/14/2132        37.0           1.00           100 (H)        53 (H)         \nDate/Time         bPH            \n06/14/2132        7.35           \n\nDate/Time         ALT/SGPT       AST/SGOT       ALKP           TBILI          \n06/14/2132        16             22             54             0.9            \nDate/Time         NT-BNP         CK-MB          TROP-I         \n06/14/2132                       NEGATIVE       NEGATIVE       \n06/14/2132        325                                          \n\nDate/Time         PT             PT-INR         PTT            \n06/14/2132        12.8           1.0            26.8           \n\nDate/Time         WBC            RBC            HGB            HCT            \n06/14/2132        22.9 (H)       4.89           14.1           42.9           \nDate/Time         MCV            MCH            MCHC           PLT            \n06/14/2132        88             28.9           32.9           190            \nDate/Time         DIFFR          METHOD         %NEUT          %LYMPH         \n06/14/2132        RECEIVED       Auto           82 (H)         15 (L)         \n\nDate/Time         UA-GLUC        UA-KET         UA-SPGR        UA-BLD         \n06/14/2132        NEGATIVE       NEGATIVE       1.015          NEGATIVE       \n\nDate/Time         UA-PH          UA-PROT        UA-NIT         UA-WBC         \n06/14/2132        5.0            NEGATIVE       NEGATIVE       NEGATIVE       \n\n06/14/2132 07:10 CXR\n     Right upper lobe and right middle lobe opacity, new since\n     5/27/2132, suspicious for pneumonia.\n     Lines and tubes as described above, without evidence of\n     pneumothorax following left IJ placement.\n\nEKG: sinus tachycardia at 134bpm; right ventricular hypertrophy; 0.5mm ST depression V6\n\nAssessment and Plan\n\nMr. Pearson is a pleasant 87 year old gentleman with a history of COPD, never intubated, who presented with one day of dyspnea.  He had a fever to 103, and presented with hypotension and respiratory distress requiring intubation.  He has an elevated wbc and an increased creatinine to 1.6; his chest x-ray is consistent with a RUL and RML pneumonia, and he has a low bnp negative for cardiac stretching.  His presentation is consistent with sepsis secondary to pneumonia.\n\nSepsis: continue EGDT, with goal MAP>65 and goal CVP of 8-12\na. IVF with NS for goal CVP 8-12\nb. pressors as needed (vasopressin +/- levophed) for goal MAP>65 (currently off pressors)\nc. monitor urine output\nd. measure central venous oxygen saturation\ne. antibiotics for pneumonia: would treat with vancomycin and cefepime, check vancomycin trough tomorrow am\nf.  f/u all culture data\ng. continue advair 250/50\nh. no need for steroids currently, and will not check cort-stim in setting of having received solumedrol in ED\ni.  hold antihypertensives (losartan 100mg qd and toprol 100mg qd) in setting of hypotension\n\nARF: creatinine up to 1.6 from baseline of 1.1, likely pre-renal etiology in setting of sepsis; will give trial hydration\n\nPpx: ranitidine and heparin\n\n \n_______________________________\nNoah G.
